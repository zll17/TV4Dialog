1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,040
<1-1,Chandler>我真不敢相信你会这么说
<1-1,Chandler>I can't believe you'd actually say that.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,620
<1-1,Chandler>我不是咸味先生而是花生先生
<1-1,Chandler>I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,930
<1-2,Joey>才怪  咸味先生是个水手
<1-2,Joey>No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,490
<1-2,Joey>他应该是最强硬的点心
<1-2,Joey>He's gotta be the toughest snack there is.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,640
<1-3,Ross>我说不好  你不会想和玉米作对的
<1-3,Ross>I don't know. You don't wanna mess with Cornnuts.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,260
<1-3,Ross>它们简直是疯了
<1-3,Ross>They're crazy.

8

<1-4,Monica>上帝呀  你们应该看看这个
<1-4,Monica>Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,530
<1-4,Monica>有个变态拿着望远镜
<1-4,Monica>There's some creep out there with a telescope.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,330
<1-5,Ross>我真不敢相信他在看我们
<1-5,Ross>I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,730
<1-6,Rachel>真恶心
<1-6,Rachel>Oh, that is so sick.

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,590
<1-7,Chandler>我感觉被冒犯了
<1-7,Chandler>I feel violated.

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,470
<1-7,Chandler>而且很不爽
<1-7,Chandler>And not in a good way.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,510
<1-8,Phoebe>怎会有人这样
<1-8,Phoebe>How can people do that?

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,080
<1-8,Phoebe>你们看  丑裸男有双重力鞋
<1-8,Phoebe>You guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,820
<2-1,Chandler>我跟你们说  几年后  学童将会把它
<2-1,Chandler>I'm telling you, years from now, school children will study it...

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,180
<2-1,Chandler>奉为首次约会完美案例研究
<2-1,Chandler>...as one of the greatest first dates of all time.

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,750
<2-1,Chandler>太令人难以置信了
<2-1,Chandler>It was unbelievable.

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,120
<2-1,Chandler>我们可以完全做自己  无须耍任何花招
<2-1,Chandler>We could totaly be ourselves. We didn't have to any play games.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
<2-2,Monica>你打过电话给她没
<2-2,Monica>Have you called her yet?

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,270
<2-3,Chandler>让她知道我喜欢她  你疯了不成
<2-3,Chandler>Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?

37
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,500
<2-3,Chandler>-伙计  -太恶心了
<2-3,Chandler>- Guys. - It's gross.

38

<2-3,Chandler>才第二天  你要我显得多渴望
<2-3,Chandler>It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,940
<2-4,Joey and Ross>-我说的对吧  -对  让她悬着心吧
<2-4,Joey and Ross>- I'm right. Right  - Yeah, let her dangle.

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,660
<2-5,Monica>我无法相信我爸妈催着我找你们这种男人
<2-5,Monica>I can't believe my parents are actually pushing me to find one of you people.

41
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,930
<2-6,Phoebe>算了  行动吧
<2-6,Phoebe>Come on. Just do it.

42
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,380
<2-6,Phoebe>打给她  别这么大男子主义
<2-6,Phoebe>Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,160
<2-7,Chandler>我得说一句  这还是旧金山特色
<2-7,Chandler>Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,510
<2-7,Chandler>-机器声  -她的答录机吗
<2-7,Chandler>- I got her machine. - Her answering machine?

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,480
<2-9,Chandler>不  有趣的是  她的落叶清扫机接的
<2-9,Chandler>No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,890
<2-10,Phoebe>那你为何不留言
<2-10,Phoebe>So, why didn't you say anything?

47
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,050
<2-11,Chandler>不行  上次我想随意留两句话的时候
<2-11,Chandler>No. Last time I left a spontaneous message...

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,060
<2-11,Chandler>最后说了"对滴  是这样哦"
<2-11,Chandler>... I ended up using the phrase,"Yes,indeed-io."

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,380
<2-12,Monica>看  是瑞秋和巴瑞
<2-12,Monica>Look, it's Rachel and Barry.

50
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,900
<2-12,Monica>不  大家别一起回头
<2-12,Monica>No, don't everybody look at once!

51
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,450
<2-13,Ross>怎么了
<2-13,Ross>What's going on?

52
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,570
<2-14,Phoebe>-他们只是在讲话  -他是否神情落寞
<2-14,Phoebe>- They're just talking. - Does he look upset?

53
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,550
<2-15,Ross>他是否像被告知滚远点的样子
<2-15,Ross>Does he look like he was told to shove anything?

54
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,500
<2-16,Phoebe>没有  其实他正在微笑
<2-16,Phoebe>No. Actually, he's smiling.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,010
<2-16,Phoebe>我的老天  不要那样干
<2-16,Phoebe>Oh, my God. Don't do that.

56
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,400
<2-17,Ross>怎么啦  怎么啦  怎么啦
<2-17,Ross>What? What? What?

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,690
<2-18,Phoebe>对街的男人刚踢了一只鸽子
<2-18,Phoebe>That man across the street just kicked that pigeon.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,150
<2-19,Chandler>基本上  法案就是这么成为法律的
<2-19,Chandler>And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-21,Chandler>懂了吗  嗨  瑞秋
<2-21,Chandler>See? Hey, Rach.

60
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,190
<2-22,Monica>情况如何

<2-23,Rachel>你们知道吗  其实感觉好极了
<2-23,Rachel>You know, it was actually really great.

62
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,360
<2-23,Rachel>他带我到俄罗斯茶室餐厅吃饭
<2-23,Rachel>He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room,

63
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,130
<2-23,Rachel>我点了那种一戳有奶油喷出来的鸡肉
<2-23,Rachel>I had that chicken, where you poke it and butter squirts out.

64
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,180
<2-24,Phoebe>今天真不是鸟儿的好日子
<2-24,Phoebe>Not a good day for birds.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,100
<2-25,Rachel>然后我们一路走到本多尔商场
<2-25,Rachel>Then we took a walk down to Bendall's,

66
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,530
<2-25,Rachel>我告诉他不要  他还是买了香奈儿给我
<2-25,Rachel>And I told him not to,but he got me a bottle of Chanel.

67
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,840
<2-26,Ross>真体贴  这是在你跟他说别再来电话
<2-26,Ross>That's nice. Now was that before or after you told him...

68
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,860
<2-26,Ross>别再送你花  别再来烦你之前还是之后
<2-26,Ross>...to stop calling,stop sending flowers and to generally leave you alone?

69
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,860
<2-27,Rachel>老实说  我没机会开口
<2-27,Rachel>Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

70
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
<2-27,Rachel>能再见到他的感觉真好
<2-27,Rachel>It was just so nice to see him again.

71
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,070
<2-27,Rachel>感觉是那么自在而熟悉

72
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,390
<2-27,Rachel>感觉真好
<2-27,Rachel>It was just nice.

73
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,730
<2-28,Ross>你已讲了两遍
<2-28,Ross>That's nice twice.

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,420
<2-28,Ross>瑞秋  这是怎么回事
<2-28,Ross>Rachel, what's going on?

75
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,440
<2-29,Monica>你难道忘了曾经在婚礼上抛弃巴瑞吗
<2-29,Monica>Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?

76
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,310
<2-30,Joey>你上哪儿去了

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,520
<2-31,Rachel>今天和他在一起感觉不同
<2-31,Rachel>It was different with him today.

78

<2-31,Rachel>他今天不像是牙医
<2-31,Rachel>He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.

79
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,280
<2-31,Rachel>我们玩得很开心  这样有什么不对吗
<2-31,Rachel>I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that?

<2-32,Chandler>是的

<2-35,Monica>那么他订婚的对象刚好...
<2-35,Monica>How about the fact that he's engaged to another woman...

<2-35,Monica>是你曾经的好友这件事呢

<2-36,Rachel>我下午会去找他谈分手
<2-36,Rachel>I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.

<3-3,Rachel>我没疯对吧  我们从未如此合拍过
<3-3,Rachel>I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.

<6-2,Monica>For future reference, that thing in your hand...

132
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,950
<6-2,Monica>...也可以当电话使
<6-2,Monica>...can also be used as a phone.

133
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
<6-3,Chandler>这电话没问题啊
<6-3,Chandler>Yes, it's working.

134
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,710
<6-4,Joey>-她为何不回电  -或许她没听到你留言
<6-4,Joey>- Why isn't she calling? - Maybe she never got your message.

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,100
<6-5,Phoebe>如果愿意  你可以打给她的答录机
<6-5,Phoebe>If you want, you call her machine,

136
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,180
<6-5,Phoebe>如果听见许多哔声
<6-5,Phoebe>and if she has a lot of beeps...

137
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,970
<6-5,Phoebe>那代表她或许还没收留言
<6-5,Phoebe>...that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.

138
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,460
<6-6,Chandler>你不认为这样会使我有点
<6-6,Chandler>Doesn't that make me seem?

139
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,000
<6-7,Ross>绝望  迫切  可悲吗
<6-7,Ross>Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,620
<6-8,Chandler>你显然看过我的个人广告
<6-8,Chandler>You obviously saw my personal ad.

141
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,660
<6-9,Phoebe>哔几声
<6-9,Phoebe>How many beeps?

142
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,300
<6-10,Chandler>她接了
<6-10,Chandler>She answered.

143
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,690
<6-11,Monica>此时你该向她打招呼才对
<6-11,Monica>This is where you'd use that "hello" word.

144
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,570
<6-12,Chandler>我不能跟她讲话  她显然听到我的留言
<6-12,Chandler>I won't talk to her. She got my message...

145
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,650
<6-12,Chandler>而且选择不回电  我既迫切又被人冷落
<6-12,Chandler>...and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.

146
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,940
<6-12,Chandler>我真想念纯迫切的滋味
<6-12,Chandler>God, I miss just being needy.

147
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,520
<6-14,Phoebe>他接受了吗
<6-14,Phoebe>So how'd he take it?

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,320
<6-15,Rachel>事实上  还不错
<6-15,Rachel>Pretty well,actually.

149
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,740
<6-16,Monica>瑞秋  你头发上为何有牙线
<6-16,Monica>Rach. How come you have dental floss in your hair?

150
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,700
<6-17,Rachel>-有吗  -当然
<6-17,Rachel>- Oh, do l? - Uh, hmm.

151
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,320
<6-18,Monica>我们以在他椅子上做爱告终
<6-18,Monica>We ended up having sex in his chair.

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,090
<6-19,Rachel>你们在他椅子上做爱
<6-19,Rachel>You had sex in his chair?

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,130
<6-20,Monica>我说得有点太大声了  是不是
<6-20,Monica>I said that a little too loudly, didn't l?

154
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,880
<6-21,Ross>你们做了什么
<6-21,Ross>You had what?

155
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,140
<6-22,Phoebe>在他椅子上做爱
<6-22,Phoebe>Sex in his chair.

156
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,570
<6-23,Ross>什么  你到底在想什么
<6-23,Ross>What...? What were you thinking?

157
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,190
<6-24,Rachel>我不知道  我们仍在乎对方
<6-24,Rachel>I don't know. We still care about each other.

158
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,820
<6-24,Rachel>我们曾相爱过  就像你和卡罗尔一样
<6-24,Rachel>There's a history there. It's like you and Carol.

159
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,060
<6-25,Ross>不  根本不像我和卡罗尔
<6-25,Ross>No, it's nothing like me and Carol.

160
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,840
<6-26,Rachel>得了吧  如果她说
<6-26,Rachel>Please. If she said to you,

161
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,840
<6-26,Rachel>"罗斯  我此时只想和你在这沙发上缠绵"
<6-26,Rachel>"Ross,I want you on this couch... right here, right now,"

162
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,450
<6-26,Rachel>你会怎么回答
<6-26,Rachel>what would you say?

163
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,160
<6-27,Chandler>如果能帮你思考  我可以过去点
<6-27,Chandler>If it helps, I could slide over.

164
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,940
<6-28,Ross>这完全是两回事  就像苹果和桔子
<6-28,Ross>It's a totally different situation. It's apples and oranges.

165
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,130
<6-28,Ross>是牙医和女同志的差别  我走了
<6-28,Ross>It's orthodontists and lesbians. I gotta go.

166
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,010
<6-29,Phoebe>-你要上哪儿去  -我就是要走  行吗
<6-29,Phoebe>- Where are you going? - I just have to go, all right?

167
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,470
<6-30,Ross>我需要理由吗  我有自己的人生要过
<6-30,Ross>Do I need a reason? I have things to do with my life.

168
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,070
<6-30,Ross>我有许多事要做
<6-30,Ross>I have a jam-packed schedule.

169
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,000
<6-30,Ross>我现在已经迟到了好吗
<6-30,Ross>And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?

<7-2,Chandler>你这种人都该下地狱
<7-2,Chandler>Hell is filled with people like you.

230
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,720
<8-6,Mindy>除了萝瑞·沙弗之外
<8-6,Mindy>except for maybe Laurie Schaffer,

231
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,410
<8-6,Mindy>我现在也不跟她说话了
<8-6,Mindy>who I don't talk to anywhere,

232
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,300
<8-6,Mindy>因为她减肥成功后刻薄许多
<8-6,Mindy>...'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight...

233
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,470
<8-6,Mindy>但是脸蛋却依旧丑陋无比
<8-6,Mindy>...and it turns out,she doesn't have a pretty face.

<8-7,Rachel>-那我问了  -好的

<8-11,Rachel>-你就想问我这些  -对  就这些
<8-11,Rachel>- That's all you wanted to ask? - That's all.

238
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,340
<8-14,Mindy>-怎么了  -不只这样
<8-14,Mindy>- What? - That's not all.

<8-15,Rachel>-当然是的  -也不全是
<8-15,Rachel>- Oh, sure it is. -Oh, no, it isn't.

240
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,270
<8-16,Mindy>我认为巴瑞有其他的女人
<8-16,Mindy>I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.

241
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,200
<8-17,Rachel>你怎会这样想
<8-17,Rachel>What would make you think that?

242
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,400
<8-18,Mindy>宣布订婚后他就变了样
<8-18,Mindy>Ever since we announce the engagement, he's acted weird.

243
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,510
<8-18,Mindy>昨晚他回家时  身上有香奈儿的味道
<8-18,Mindy>And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.

244
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,000
<8-18,Mindy>真的
<8-18,Mindy>Really?

245
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,050
<8-19,Rachel>明蒂  如果这样能让你好过点
<8-19,Rachel>Mindy. If it'll make you feel any better...
