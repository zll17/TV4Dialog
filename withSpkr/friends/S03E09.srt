<1-2,Phoebe>You know, instead of watching football, you could help.

00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,550
<1-3,The Guys>我们知道啊
<1-3,The Guys>We know.

5

<1-4,Monica>瑞秋  你要把棉花糖排成同心圆

<1-5,Rachel>不  莫妮卡  是你要把棉花糖排成同心圆
<1-5,Rachel>No, Mon. you want to put them in concentric circles.

<2-1,Phoebe>我倒想坐下来看看橄榄球
<2-1,Phoebe>I am gonna sit down and try to watch one of these things.

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,010
<2-2,Ross>中场休息
<2-2,Ross>Halftime.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,330
<2-3,Joey>谁想出去玩球
<2-3,Joey>Hey, who wants to throw the ball around a little?

29
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,040
<2-3,Joey>来个三对三怎么样
<2-3,Joey>Maybe a little 3-on-3 going?

30
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,780
<2-4,Rachel>-一定很好玩  -我可以参加吗
<2-4,Rachel>- That would be so much fun! - Can I play too?

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,230
<2-5,Phoebe>我从来没玩过橄榄球
<2-5,Phoebe>I've never played football, like ever.

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,580
<2-6,Joey>太好了  你可以守钱德勒
<2-6,Joey>Great! You can cover Chandler.

33
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,620
<2-7,Chandler>不  我不想玩球
<2-7,Chandler>No, I don't really want to play.

34
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,910
<2-8,Joey>拜托
<2-8,Joey>Come on man,

35
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,060
<2-8,Joey>你跟珍妮斯分手之后就一直提不起劲
<2-8,Joey>you never wanna do anything since you and Janice broke up.

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,010
<2-9,Chandler>才不是这样
<2-9,Chandler>That's not true.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,660
<2-9,Chandler>我想整天穿着浴袍吃巧克力花生
<2-9,Chandler>I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,350
<2-9,Chandler>我还想在早上喝酒
<2-9,Chandler>I want to start drinking in the morning.

39
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,560
<2-9,Chandler>别说我没有目标
<2-9,Chandler>Don't say that I don't have goals!

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,630
<2-10,Joey>钱德勒  你得把她忘了  好吗
<2-10,Joey>Chandler, you have to start getting over her, all right?

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,280
<2-10,Joey>如果你来玩球  呼吸新鲜空气
<2-10,Joey>If you play, you get some fresh air,

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,450
<2-10,Joey>也许就会忘记珍妮斯
<2-10,Joey>maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,590
<2-10,Joey>你不玩  大家都会生你的气
<2-10,Joey>If you don't play, everyone will be mad at you

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,070
<2-10,Joey>因为两队人数就不平均了  来吧
<2-10,Joey>because the teams won't be even, come on.

45
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,850
<2-11,Chandler>好  我参加
<2-11,Chandler>All right, I'll play.

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,480
<2-13,Rachel>来吧  罗斯
<2-13,Rachel>Let's do it! Ross?

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,480
<2-14,Ross>-什么  -想玩橄榄球吗
<2-14,Ross>- What? - Wanna play football?

48
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,370
<2-16,Ross>莫妮卡跟我都不能玩橄榄球
<2-16,Ross>Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.

49
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,570
<2-17,Joey>谁说的  你老妈
<2-17,Joey>Says who? Your mom?

50
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,880
<2-18,Monica and Ross>是的
<2-18,Monica and Ross>Yes.

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,200
<2-19,Monica>以前每年感恩节
<2-19,Monica>Every Thanksgiving,

52
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,090
<2-19,Monica>我们都举行触身式橄榄球比赛
<2-19,Monica>we used to have a touch football game...

53
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,820
<2-19,Monica>叫做盖勒杯
<2-19,Monica>called The Geller Bowl.

54
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,230
<2-20,Chandler>不不不  你的口气要很骄傲才对
<2-20,Chandler>No, no, no. You say that proudly!

55
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,760
<2-21,Monica>反正  罗斯跟我每次都当队长
<2-21,Monica>Anyway, Ross and l were always captains, and...

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,000
<2-21,Monica>竞争越来越激烈  有一年  第六届盖勒杯
<2-21,Monica>It got kind of competitive, and one year, Geller Bowl VI...

57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,550
<2-21,Monica>我不小心打断了罗斯的鼻子
<2-21,Monica>I accidentally broke Ross' nose.

58
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,460
<2-22,Ross>你是故意的
<2-22,Ross>It was so not an accident.

59
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,920
<2-22,Ross>她看到我就快抱住她  就用她的
<2-22,Ross>She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw...

60
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,830
<2-22,Ross>大妈胖手肘撞我的脸
<2-22,Ross>her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face...

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,500
<2-22,Ross>然后拼命往前跑
<2-22,Ross>and just kept running.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,590
<2-23,Monica>因此获得致胜的一次触地得分
<2-23,Monica>To score the winning touchdown, by the way.

63
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,250
<2-24,Ross>你没有赢  那次得分不算
<2-24,Ross>You did not win the game. The touchdown didn't count...

64
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,730
<2-24,Ross>因为你公然犯规
<2-24,Ross>because of the spectacularly illegal,

65
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,320
<2-24,Ross>野蛮地打断我的鼻子
<2-24,Ross>and by the way savage, nose-breaking.

66
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,460
<2-25,Monica>我赢了
<2-25,Monica>I won the game.

67
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,830
<2-26,Ross>是吗  那你怎么没得到盖勒杯
<2-26,Ross>Oh yeah? Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?

68
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,360
<2-27,Rachel>还真有盖勒杯吗
<2-27,Rachel>There was a Geller Cup?

69
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,250
<2-28,Ross>对  这是赢球的奖杯
<2-28,Ross>Yes, there was a trophy you got if you won the game.

70
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,880
<2-28,Ross>但爸爸说我们谁都没赢
<2-28,Ross>But our dad said nobody won that game,

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,400
<2-28,Ross>他受够了我们打来打去
<2-28,Ross>and he was sick of our fighting.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,120
<2-28,Ross>所以他把奖杯
<2-28,Ross>So he took the trophy...

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,770
<2-28,Ross>丢进了湖里
<2-28,Ross>threw it in the lake.

74
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,700
<2-29,Chandler>这个诅咒解除了没有
<2-29,Chandler>And was the curse lifted?

75
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,150
<2-30,Ross>反正
<2-30,Ross>Anyway...

76
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,710
<2-30,Ross>妈妈说不准我们再玩橄榄球了
<2-30,Ross>That's when mom said we were not allowed to play football again.

77
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,170
<2-31,Monica>你知道吗  我觉得我们应该去打球
<2-31,Monica>You know what? I think we should play a game.

78
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,060
<2-31,Monica>我是说  都已经过了12年了
<2-31,Monica>I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.

79
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,150
<2-32,Ross>跟你私下说句话好吗
<2-32,Ross>Can I see you for a second?

80
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,700
<2-32,Ross>懦夫
<2-32,Ross>Wuss!

<2-35,Chandler>Wait a minute. How we gonna get there?

83
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,600
<2-35,Chandler>我妈不准我过马路
<2-35,Chandler>Because my mom won't let me cross the street.

84
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,730
<2-35,Chandler>接着
<2-35,Chandler>Here you go.

89
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,570
<3-5,Joey>我们要选队长
<3-5,Joey>All right, we have to pick captains.

130
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,410
<3-39,Rachel>刚才会议时你说  如果乔伊拿到球
<3-39,Rachel>Now you said in the huddle that if Joey caught the ball,

131
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,110
<3-39,Rachel>你会拦住他
<3-39,Rachel>you'd be the one to stop him.

132
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,310
<3-40,Ross>现在你没拦住  这是橄榄球计策吗
<3-40,Ross>Now, you didn't. So is that like a football strategy?

133
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,720
<3-40,Ross>是啊  一上来就落后是我计划的一部分
<3-40,Ross>Yeah, it was part of my plan to fall instantly behind. So...

134

180
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,660
<7-6,Joey>更有说服力一些
<7-6,Joey>if I ask for it myself, you know.

188
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,510
<7-10,Joey>我不想说得这么明显  不过...
<7-10,Joey>I don't like to say it out loud but...

<8-34,Monica>on the broken nose or the buzzer

240
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,290
<8-34,Monica>或是你可能单核细胞增多

<8-37,Ross>Oh, really? Why's that?

246
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,850
<9-1,Monica>因为赢得人可以拿到这个

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,520
<11-2,Rachel>我跑得很远

<11-3,Monica>Like the turkey, Ross is done!

282
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,050
<11-4,Ross>你赢没什么意外的
<11-4,Ross>There's no surprise that you're winning.

283
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,060
<11-4,Ross>你先挑队员  强的在你那队
<11-4,Ross>Cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.

284
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,270
<11-5,Monica>你真可悲  为什么你不肯承认我们赢球
<11-5,Monica>You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept that we're winning...

285
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,670
<11-5,Monica>是因为我比你厉害
<11-5,Monica>because I'm better than you?

286
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,620
<11-6,Monica>真会回嘴  好一声叹息
<11-6,Monica>Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!

287
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,940
<11-6,Monica>好吧  我要让你心服口服
<11-6,Monica>All right, you know what? I'll prove it to you, okay?

288
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,480
<11-6,Monica>我用乔伊跟你换瑞秋  我还是照赢不误
<11-6,Monica>I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.

289
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,350
<11-7,Ross>什么  男生对女生
<11-7,Ross>What? The guys against the girls?

290
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,380
<11-7,Ross>这太荒谬了
<11-7,Ross>See that's ridiculous,

291
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,990
<11-7,Ross>莫妮卡  我只要三次触地得分就追上你了
<11-7,Ross>Monica. Because I'm only down by three touchdowns.

292
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,280
<11-8,Monica>那就得分给我看啊
<11-8,Monica>Then bring it on!

293
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,700
<11-8,Monica>除非你怕会输给几个女生
<11-8,Monica>Unless of course you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.

294
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,770
<11-9,Ross>很好  瑞秋  你跟莫妮卡
<11-9,Ross>Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica.

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,280
<11-9,Ross>乔伊  你跟我一队
<11-9,Ross>Joey, you're with me.

296
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,360
<11-10,Rachel>你竟然把我交换出去
<11-10,Rachel>I can't believe you're trading me.

297
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,200
<11-11,Monica>来吧  瑞秋
<11-11,Monica>Come on Rach, come on.

<11-11,Monica>你也来尝尝赢球的滋味
<11-11,Monica>Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.

299
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,460
<11-12,Rachel>你会让我上场吗
<11-12,Rachel>You're gonna let me play?

300
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,970
<11-13,Monica>好了
<11-13,Monica>All right, then!

301
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,670
<12-1,Margha>比赛结束了  我们要去吃饭吗
<12-1,Margha>The game is over? We eat now?

302
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,530
<12-2,Chandler>比赛还没结束  我们在交换球员
<12-2,Chandler>No...The game's not over. We're switching teams.

303
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,170
<12-3,Joey>钱德勒觉得我对他造成了太大的威胁
<12-3,Joey>Chandler finds me so intimidating that

304
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,980
<12-3,Joey>还是跟他同一队比较好
<12-3,Joey>it's better if we're on the same team.

305
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,940
<12-4,Ross>好  我们比赛吧  走
<12-4,Ross>Okay, let's play. Let's go.

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,760
<12-5,Chandler>等一下  乔伊
<12-5,Chandler>Hold on a second, Joe.

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,720
<12-5,Chandler>荷兰人是从哪里来的
<12-5,Chandler>Where do Dutch people come from?

308
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,830
<12-6,Joey>这个嘛  宾州的达琪来自宾州
<12-6,Joey>Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania.

309
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,660
<12-7,Chandler>其他的荷兰人呢
<12-7,Chandler>And the other Dutch people?

310
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,430
<12-7,Chandler>他们是从荷兰附近来的吧
<12-7,Chandler>They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?

311
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,450
<12-8,Joey>别想骗我
<12-8,Joey>Nice try.

312
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,200
<12-8,Joey>荷兰是虚构出来的地方
<12-8,Joey>The Netherlands is this make-believe place...

314
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,720
<12-8,Joey>是小飞侠和小仙子的家
<12-8,Joey>where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.

<12-10,Ross>Enough with "geography for the insane." Let's play some ball, guys.

317
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,780
<12-11,Joey>我不跟这家伙一起打球
<12-11,Joey>No... I'm not playing with this guy.

318
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,420
<12-12,Chandler>我无所谓
<12-12,Chandler>Fine with me.

319
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,320
<3-17,Rachel>知道吗  我受够了
<3-17,Rachel>Okay, you know what, I've had enough of this.

320
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,150
<3-18,Ross>干脆直接点
<3-18,Ross>Let's just cut to the chase here, okay?

<13-4,Margha>which, by the way, I find really weird...

329
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,810
<13-4,Margha>不过我会选钱德勒
<13-4,Margha>I would have to say Chandler.

330
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,730
<13-6,Joey>等等
<13-6,Joey>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

331
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,520
<13-6,Joey>她显然没听懂问题
<13-6,Joey>She obviously didn't understand the question.

332
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,800
<13-7,Chandler>你可以请虎克船长  解释给她听啊
<13-7,Chandler>Why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her?

333
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,810
<13-8,Margha>对不起  乔伊  这是我的真心话
<13-8,Margha>I'm sorry, Joey. That is my truth.

409
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,970
<15-22,Phoebe>如果没有人抱住瑞秋
<15-22,Phoebe>If nobody tagged Rachel,

410
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,500
<15-22,Phoebe>那比赛就还没结束吧
<15-22,Phoebe>then isn't the play still going?

415
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,340
<15-25,Chandler>重要的是荷兰女孩选了我
<15-25,Chandler>The important thing is the Dutch girl picked me!

416
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,450
<15-25,Chandler>是我  不是你  荷兰妹子爱钱德勒

<15-25,Chandler>谢谢  阿姆斯特丹  晚安
<15-25,Chandler>Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!

418
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,050
<16-1,Rachel>我们应该多抽空玩橄榄球
<16-1,Rachel>We should definitely play football more often.

419
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,720
<16-1,Rachel>也许我们可以参加个联盟
<16-1,Rachel>Maybe there's a league we could join in or something.

420
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,820
<16-2,Phoebe>不是有个"国家橄榄球联盟"吗
<16-2,Phoebe>Isn't there a "National Football League"?

421
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,320
<16-3,Chandler>没错  星期天和星期一晚上比赛
<16-3,Chandler>Yes, there is. They play on Sundays and Monday nights.

<16-4,Rachel>太可惜了  我星期一晚上要上班
<16-4,Rachel>Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.

423
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,270
<16-5,Phoebe>这菜真好吃
<16-5,Phoebe>This stuffing is amazing.

424
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,310
<16-5,Phoebe>要给他们带一些过去吗
<16-5,Phoebe>Do you think we should bring them some?

425
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,360
<16-6,Joey>他们饿到不行的时候  自然会进来
<16-6,Joey>When they're hungry enough, they'll come in.

426

<17-2,Ross>-放手  -不  你放手

<17-3,Monica>No!

428
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,920
<17-4,Ross>为什么每次都只剩我们两个抱着球不放
<17-4,Ross>How come it's always us left on the field holding the ball?

429
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,060
<17-5,Monica>不知道  我想是因为其他人不太在乎吧
<17-5,Monica>I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.

430
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,240
<17-6,Ross>开始下雪了
<17-6,Ross>Hey, it's starting to snow.
