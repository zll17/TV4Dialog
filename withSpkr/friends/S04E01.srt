175
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,160
<12-3,Ross>不是我一个人的错   她写说
<12-3,Ross>But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,390
<12-4,Joey>不行

<12-5,Chandler>你得偿所愿 跟她复合了
<12-5,Chandler>Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel.

181
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,710
<12-5,Chandler>要是你现在提出来
<12-5,Chandler>If you bring this up now,

182
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,370
<12-5,Chandler>你会毁了你一生中最美好的事
