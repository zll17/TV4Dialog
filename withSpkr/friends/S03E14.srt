1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,090
<1-1,Singer>因为每次我看见你的脸
<1-1,Singer>'Cause every time I see your face

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,110
<1-1,Singer>就情不自禁地失态
<1-1,Singer>I can't help but fall from grace

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,680
<1-2,Joey>这女的很棒
<1-2,Joey>This girl's good.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,620
<1-3,Phoebe>是啊  歌词押韵  我以前倒没想过
<1-3,Phoebe>Yeah, a song with rhyming words! I never thought of that before.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,410
<1-4,Chandler>我喜欢她
<1-4,Chandler>I like her.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,910
<1-5,Phoebe>为什么  因为她会唱歌  会弹吉他
<1-5,Phoebe>Why? Because she can sing and play guitar

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,870
<1-5,Phoebe>还会边弹边唱吗
<1-5,Phoebe>and do both at the same time?

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,420
<1-6,Chandler>这正是我对表演艺人的期待
<1-6,Chandler>That's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,760
<1-7,Monica>看  你忌妒得要命
<1-7,Monica>Look at you, all jealous.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,000
<1-8,Ross>菲比  拜托  你们俩的风格完全不同
<1-8,Ross>Pheebs. Come on, you two have completely different styles.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,720
<1-8,Ross>她比较...  那个
<1-8,Ross>You know, she's more.... You know?

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,740
<1-8,Ross>而你比较...
<1-8,Ross>And you're more....

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,630
<1-9,Singer>说你会留在我身边
<1-9,Singer>Say you'll stay beside me.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,230
<1-10,Phoebe>看到没  她唱完了大家都很开心
<1-10,Phoebe>See? Everybody else is happy she's done.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,730
<1-11,Singer>我接下来要唱的是
<1-11,Singer>Okay, my next song's called:

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,410
<1-11,Singer>菲比·布菲  我该怎么说  我很怀念当初
<1-11,Singer>Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say? I Really Loved When We Were...

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,670
<1-11,Singer>一起唱歌的日子  我不该那样离开你的
<1-11,Singer>Singing Partners and I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,380
<1-12,Phoebe>不是吧  唱这种别有深意的歌
<1-12,Phoebe>No. One of those "look for the hidden meaning" songs.

34
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,550
<2-1,Singer>嘿  菲比
<2-1,Singer>Hey, Phoebe.

35
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,770
<2-2,Phoebe>嘿  莱丝莉
<2-2,Phoebe>Hey, Leslie.

36
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,660
<2-2,Phoebe>你怎么知道我会在这里
<2-2,Phoebe>How'd you know I'd be here?

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,660
<2-3,Leslie>我在卖大鱼的地方碰到弗拉德
<2-3,Leslie>I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,500
<2-3,Leslie>他说你常在这里表演  所以...
<2-3,Leslie>He said you played here a lot, so....

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,310
<2-4,Chandler>我要上洗手间
<2-4,Chandler>All right, listen, I have to go to the bathroom.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,470
<2-4,Chandler>如果她们又谈到"大鱼"
<2-4,Chandler>But the place with "big-fish" comes up again...

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,940
<2-4,Chandler>我想知道是好几条大鱼
<2-4,Chandler>I'd like to know whether that's several big fish

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,650
<2-4,Chandler>还是只有一条大鱼
<2-4,Chandler>or just one big fish.

43
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,340
<2-5,Joey>菲比说你写广告歌
<2-5,Joey>So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,130
<2-6,Phoebe>我是说她抛弃我去写广告歌
<2-6,Phoebe>Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,660
<2-7,Joey>-有没有我们听过的  -当然有
<2-7,Joey>- Anything we might've heard of? - Yeah!

46
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,910
<2-8,Leslie>家永远不远
<2-8,Leslie>Home is never far away.

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,220
<2-8,Leslie>回家的感觉就是家星炖品
<2-8,Leslie>Home is Homestar Stew.

48
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,320
<2-9,Leslie>但我已经不写了  我有点厌倦了
<2-9,Leslie>But I don't do that anymore. I got kind of sick of it.

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,810
<2-9,Leslie>我也写不出好东西了  所以被炒鱿鱼了
<2-9,Leslie>And then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.

50
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,950
<2-10,Phoebe>太可惜了
<2-10,Phoebe>Bummer.

51
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,950
<2-11,Leslie>你知道  我只是...
<2-11,Leslie>Well, you know, I was just....

52
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,480
<2-11,Leslie>我只是想  只是希望
<2-11,Leslie>I was just thinking and just hoping that...

53
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,600
<2-11,Leslie>也许你愿意跟我再度合作
<2-11,Leslie>maybe you'd want to get back together?

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,510
<2-12,Phoebe>不了  谢谢你

<2-13,Leslie>Come on, Phoebe. Would you just think about it?

59
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,230
<2-17,Phoebe>你们都要记住这个教训
<2-17,Phoebe>Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right?

60
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,570
<2-17,Phoebe>一旦背叛我  我就成了冷血的女人
<2-17,Phoebe>Once you betray me, I become like the Ice Woman.

61
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,530
<2-17,Phoebe>我是铁石心肠  绝不心软
<2-17,Phoebe>I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

62
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,990
<2-17,Phoebe>任何东西都无法穿透我这冰冷的外衣
<2-17,Phoebe>You know, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.

63
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,970
<2-17,Phoebe>给我一张纸巾好吗

<3-2,Chandler>叫做"等到尿崩而死的前一刻"
<3-2,Chandler>called "Wait Until the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die."

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,270
<6-18,Joey>我不能跟你说
<6-18,Joey>I can't tell you that.

136
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,770
<6-18,Joey>我这辈子从没
<6-18,Joey>It's like the most awful horrible thing

137
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,510
<6-18,Joey>做过那么过分的事
<6-18,Joey>I've ever done in my whole life.

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,050
<6-19,Monica>别告诉我们
<6-19,Monica>You know what, don't tell us.

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,900
<6-19,Monica>等钱德勒回家再说
<6-19,Monica>We'll just wait till Chandler gets home.

140
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,840
<6-19,Monica>那样更好玩
<6-19,Monica>Because it'll be more fun that way.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,920
<6-19,Monica>好吧
<6-19,Monica>All right.

142
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,420
<6-20,Joey>大概是四年前
<6-20,Joey>Okay. It was, like, four years ago.

143
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,310
<6-20,Joey>金吉儿和我约会了几次  有一个周末
<6-20,Joey>Ginger and I gone out a few times. Then this one weekend...

144
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,880
<6-20,Joey>我们去了她爸爸的度假木屋
<6-20,Joey>we went up to her Dad's cabin...

145
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,120
<6-20,Joey>只有我们两个人
<6-20,Joey>just me, her and

146
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,750
<6-20,Joey>还有她那讨人厌的小狗椒椒
<6-20,Joey>her annoying little dog, Pepper.

147
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,870
<6-20,Joey>那天晚上我做了一顿浪漫的烛光晚餐
<6-20,Joey>Well, that night I cooked this really romantic dinner...

148
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,850
<6-21,Monica>你害她食物中毒了
<6-21,Monica>You gave her food poisoning!

149
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,210
<6-21,Monica>但愿如此
<6-21,Monica>I wish.

150
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,260
<6-22,Joey>晚饭后  我们两个和椒椒在炉火前睡着了
<6-22,Joey>After dinner, me, her and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,800
<6-22,Joey>我半夜醒来时看到火快熄了
<6-22,Joey>I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the fire was dying out...

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,400
<6-22,Joey>就拿起一条木柴丢进去
<6-22,Joey>so I picked up a log and threw it on.

153
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,440
<6-22,Joey>至少我以为那是条木柴
<6-22,Joey>Or at least what I thought was a log.

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,120
<6-23,Phoebe>我的天  你把椒椒丢进火里了
<6-23,Phoebe>Oh, my God! You threw Pepper on the fire!

155
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,980
<6-24,Joey>但愿如此
<6-24,Joey>I wish.

156
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,950
<6-24,Joey>我应该告诉你们
<6-24,Joey>See, I guess another thing I probably should've

157

<6-24,Joey>金吉儿
<6-24,Joey>told you about Ginger...

<6-24,Joey>她其实
<6-24,Joey>is that she kind of has a...

159
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,710
<6-24,Joey>装了义肢
<6-24,Joey>artificial leg.

160
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,700
<6-24,Joey>我的天

<6-25,Monica>乔伊  你把她的腿丢进火里后做了什么
<6-25,Monica>Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?

162
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,520
<6-26,Joey>我逃跑了
<6-26,Joey>I ran!

163
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,250

<7-1,Chandler>That's the best kiss I've had...

164
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,670
<7-1,Chandler>其他人相比  这个吻是最棒的

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,890
<12-9,Phoebe>我现在要唱一首非常哀伤的歌
<12-9,Phoebe>I'm gonna play a song now that's really, really sad.

252
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,850
<12-9,Phoebe>叫做《魔术箱搞混了》
<12-9,Phoebe>It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up."

253

<13-1,Lecturer>特大号的手镯  特大号的耳环
<13-1,Lecturer>Oversized bracelets, oversized earrings...

254
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,530
<13-1,Lecturer>一般来说特大号的配件是今年的主流
<13-1,Lecturer>oversizing of accessories, in general, is very popular now.

255
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,560
<14-1,Monica>可以借我吗  我的牛奶坏了
<14-1,Monica>Can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad.

256
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,630
<14-2,Chandler>我不喜欢这样
<14-2,Chandler>I hate that.

257
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,090
<14-3,Monica>我以前很喜欢跟别人分着用  结果车被偷了
<14-3,Monica>I once had a thing of half-and-half. Stole my car.

258
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,830
<14-4,Chandler>你跟金吉儿的约会怎么样了
<14-4,Chandler>So how was your date with Ginger?

259
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,260
<14-5,Monica>太棒了
<14-5,Monica>Great.

260
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,790
<14-6,Chandler>很棒  她
<14-6,Chandler>It was great. She's....

261
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,270
<14-6,Chandler>她很棒  长得漂亮性情好  无可挑剔
<14-6,Chandler>She's great. Great looking great personality. She's greatness.

262
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,620
<14-7,Monica>看样子她很
<14-7,Monica>Sounds like she's got the...

263
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,710
<14-7,Monica>完整
<14-7,Monica>whole package.

264
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,120
<14-8,Chandler>乔伊跟你说过那条腿的事了
<14-8,Chandler>Joey told you about the leg, huh?

265
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,720
<14-9,Monica>老天  吓死我了
<14-9,Monica>Oh, God! It freaked me out.

266
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,050
<14-10,Chandler>我知道不应该这样  但这是真的
<14-10,Chandler>Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did.

267
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,850
<14-10,Chandler>我喜欢她  想跟她交往下去
<14-10,Chandler>I like her, I don't wanna stop seeing her,

268
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,490
<14-10,Chandler>不过我总忍不住想问  "你的腿呢"
<14-10,Chandler>but every so often it's like: "Hey, you know what? Where's your leg?"

269
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,820
<14-12,Chandler>我是全世界最渺小的人  是吧
<14-12,Chandler>I mean, I'm the smallest person in the world, aren't I?

270
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
<14-12,Chandler>我是全世界最渺小的人
<14-12,Chandler>I'm the smallest person in the world.

271
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,490
<14-11,Joey>早安
<14-11,Joey>Morning.

272
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,900
<14-12,Chandler>其实他才是全世界最渺小的人
<14-12,Chandler>Actually, he's the smallest person in the world.

273
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,500
<14-13,Joey>听过火烧腿的事了吧
<14-13,Joey>Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

274
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,000
<14-14,Chandler>她提过
<14-14,Chandler>It came up.

275
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,540
<14-15,Joey>我知道机会渺茫  可是
<14-15,Joey>Listen, I know it's a long shot, but...

276
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,750
<14-15,Joey>她觉得这件事好笑吗
<14-15,Joey>by any chance, did she find that funny?

277
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,510
<15-1,Ross>我只是打了一下瞌睡
<15-1,Ross>So I nodded off a little!

278
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,500
<15-2,Rachel>打瞌睡  罗斯  你还打呼
<15-2,Rachel>"Nodded off"? Ross, you were snoring!

279
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,780
<15-2,Rachel>我爸的船撞上岩石  都没有这么大声
<15-2,Rachel>My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!

280
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,240
<15-3,Ross>拜托  45分钟
<15-3,Ross>Come on! Forty-five minutes....

281
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,560
<15-3,Ross>那个人讲了45分钟的露背吊带裙
<15-3,Ross>Forty-five minutes, the man talked about strappy-backed dresses.

282
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,040
<15-4,Rachel>那在冰冷的博物馆礼堂坐上四个小时
<15-4,Rachel>Okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium...

283
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,190
<15-4,Rachel>听皮兹坦教授说
<15-4,Rachel>listening to Professor "Pitstains" say:

284
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,450
<15-4,Rachel>大家好
<15-4,Rachel>"Hi, every body.

285
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,480
<15-4,Rachel>记得亿万年前死掉的东西吗
<15-4,Rachel>Remember that thing that's been died for a gazillion years ago?

286
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,780
<15-4,Rachel>我们过去不知道它有这块小骨头
<15-4,Rachel>Well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had!"

287
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,880
<15-5,Ross>首先  他是皮坦教授
<15-5,Ross>First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

288
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,820
<15-5,Ross>其次  那块小骨头证明了
<15-5,Ross>And second of all, that little bone proved that...

289
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,320
<15-5,Ross>那只恐龙有翅膀  可是不会飞
<15-5,Ross>that particular dinosaur had wings but didn't fly.

290
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,400
<15-6,Rachel>你知道我听到的是什么吗
<15-6,Rachel>Okay, you know what I just heard?

291
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,550
<15-6,Rachel>废话  废话  全是废话
<15-6,Rachel>Blah, Blah, Blah...

292
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,450
<15-7,Ross>一亿人跑去看那部
<15-7,Ross>You know what? A hundred million people went to

293
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,080
<15-7,Ross>以我的工作为题材的电影
<15-7,Ross>see a movie about what I do.

294
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,250
<15-7,Ross>不知道会有多少人去看
<15-7,Ross>I wonder how many people would go see a movie

295
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,610
<15-7,Ross>叫做《侏罗纪风衣》的电影
<15-7,Ross>called Jurassic Parka.

296
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,710
<15-8,Rachel>你实在是...
<15-8,Rachel>Oh, that is so...

297
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,360
<15-9,Ross>一群抓狂的外套控制了整个小岛
<15-9,Ross>A bunch of out-of-control jackets take over an island!

298
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,930
<15-10,Rachel>如果我的工作这么差劲
<15-10,Rachel>You know. If what I do is so lame...

299
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,560
<15-10,Rachel>那你今天早上为什么要坚持陪我去
<15-10,Rachel>then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?

300
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,530
<15-10,Rachel>这样我就不会跟马克去吗
<15-10,Rachel>Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?

301
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,400
<15-10,Rachel>不
<15-10,Rachel>No.

302
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,890
<15-11,Ross>我想跟你在一起
<15-11,Ross>I wanted to be with you.

303
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,710
<15-11,Ross>我不知道  我最近觉得
<15-11,Ross>I don't know, I feel like lately...

304
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,820
<15-11,Ross>你离我越来越远
<15-11,Ross>feel like you're slipping away from me...

305
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,400
<15-11,Ross>你有了新工作  认识了新朋友
<15-11,Ross>you know, with this new job and all these new people.

306
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,260
<15-11,Ross>你的人生多姿多彩
<15-11,Ross>And you've got this whole other life going on.

307
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,310
<15-11,Ross>我知道这很傻
<15-11,Ross>I know it's dumb...

308
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,550
<15-12,Rachel>但我痛恨不能参与你的生活
<15-12,Rachel>but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.

309
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,000
<15-12,Rachel>这并不傻
<15-12,Rachel>It's not dumb.

310
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,640
<15-12,Rachel>但也许你不参与也不要紧
<15-12,Rachel>But maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.

311
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,980
<15-12,Rachel>你懂我的意思吗
<15-12,Rachel>You know what I mean?

312
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,530
<15-12,Rachel>我是说
<15-12,Rachel>I mean, it's like...

313
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,880
<15-12,Rachel>我不希望你参与我在这方面的生活
<15-12,Rachel>I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.

314
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,180
<15-13,Ross>这样就清楚一点了
<15-13,Ross>That's a little clearer.

315
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,930
<15-14,Rachel>亲爱的  这并不表示我不爱你
<15-14,Rachel>Honey, see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you...

316
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,060
<15-14,Rachel>因为我是爱你的  我非常爱你
<15-14,Rachel>because I do. I love you, I love you so much.

317
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,530
<15-14,Rachel>但是这是我的工作  你明白吗
<15-14,Rachel>But my work It's for me, you know?

318
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,150
<15-14,Rachel>我独立自主  努力投入
<15-14,Rachel>I'm out there on my own, and I'm doing it.

319
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,450
<15-14,Rachel>这很可怕
<15-14,Rachel>And it's scary,

320
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,380
<15-14,Rachel>但我很喜欢  因为这是属于我的
<15-14,Rachel>but I love it because it's mine.

321
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,370
<15-14,Rachel>这样可以吗
<15-14,Rachel>But I mean, is that okay?

322
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,400
<15-14,Rachel>当然
<15-14,Rachel>Sure.

323
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,130
<16-1,Ginger>你在想我的腿  是吧
<16-1,Ginger>You're thinking about my leg, aren't you.

324
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,970
<16-2,Chandler>不  其实我已经忘了  那是怎么回事
<16-2,Chandler>No, actually, I forgot. What's the deal with that again?

325
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,930
<16-3,Ginger>如果你介意也不要紧
<16-3,Ginger>It's okay if it bothers you.

326
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,800
<16-3,Ginger>我只需要知道你介意到什么程度
<16-3,Ginger>I mean the only thing I need to know it's how much it bothers you...

327
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,140
<16-3,Ginger>因为我不喜欢浪费时间
<16-3,Ginger>because I don't like wasting my time.

328
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,250
<16-3,Ginger>我在浪费时间吗
<16-3,Ginger>Am I wasting my time?

329
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,560
<16-4,Chandler>不  我想没有
<16-4,Chandler>No, I don't think so.

330
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,980
<16-5,Ginger>这也没什么  只要习惯就好了
<16-5,Ginger>It's just like anything else. You just have to get used to it.

331
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,990
<16-6,Ginger>那是什么
<16-6,Ginger>What's that?

332
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,550
<16-7,Chandler>那是我的"肉瘤"
<16-7,Chandler>That's my "nubbin."

333
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,560
<16-8,Ginger>肉瘤是什么
<16-8,Ginger>What's a nubbin?

334
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,640
<16-9,Chandler>就好像是第三个乳头
<16-9,Chandler>It's kind of a third-nipple kind of thing.

335
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,810
<16-10,Ginger>你有三个乳头
<16-10,Ginger>You have three nipples?

336
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,980
<16-11,Chandler>有两个正常的
<16-11,Chandler>Well, you know, two regulars...

337
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,880
<16-11,Chandler>还有一个算不上是
<16-11,Chandler>and one that barely qualifies as a...

338
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,300
<16-11,Chandler>怎么了
<16-11,Chandler>What?

339
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,080
<16-12,Ginger>没什么  我...
<16-12,Ginger>Nothing. You know, I...

340
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,440
<16-12,Ginger>我想起来了  我该走了
<16-12,Ginger>I just remembered. I have to leave.

341
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,990
<16-13,Chandler>你要走  现在吗  为什么
<16-13,Chandler>You have to leave? Now? How come?

342
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,840
<16-14,Ginger>肉瘤  没什么
<16-14,Ginger>Well, it's nubbin. Nothing!

343
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:12,100
<16-14,Ginger>这样吧  再联络
<16-14,Ginger>You know what? I'll see you later, okay?

344
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,560
<17-1,Phoebe>我还以为你不来了
<17-1,Phoebe>I thought you weren't coming.

345
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,140
<17-2,Leslie>-你到哪里去了  -过来吧
<17-2,Leslie>- Where were you? - Come here, come here.

346
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,050
<17-2,Leslie>不要生气  好吗
<17-2,Leslie>Okay, don't get mad, okay?

347
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,960
<17-3,Phoebe>不要让我生气  好吗
<17-3,Phoebe>Don't give me a reason to get mad, okay?

348
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,560
<17-4,Leslie>我把《臭臭猫》唱给旧广告公司听
<17-4,Leslie>I played Smelly Cat for the people in my old ad agency.

349
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,100
<17-4,Leslie>他们爱死了
<17-4,Leslie>They went nuts!

350
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,090
<17-5,Phoebe>不  我说过我不要你拿去卖
<17-5,Phoebe>No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it...

351
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,350
<17-5,Phoebe>你这个大肥猫还是做了
<17-5,Phoebe>and you just you big, fat did it anyway!

352
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,320
<17-5,Phoebe>我想五年前
<17-5,Phoebe>You know what, I think, five years ago,

353
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,720
<17-5,Phoebe>我恐怕会不计一切
<17-5,Phoebe>I probably would have done anything...

354
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,160
<17-5,Phoebe>只求能跟你一起表演
<17-5,Phoebe>to play with you.

355
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,820
<17-5,Phoebe>但我自己还是可以唱
<17-5,Phoebe>But I can do it by myself.

356
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,280
<17-5,Phoebe>如果我不能信任你  就散伙吧
<17-5,Phoebe>If I can't trust you, then forget it.

357
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,770
<17-6,Leslie>不  我不想散伙
<17-6,Leslie>No, I don't wanna forget it.

358
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,680
<17-7,Phoebe>这样吧  你必须做个选择
<17-7,Phoebe>You know what? You have to choose.

359
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,970
<17-7,Phoebe>如果你觉得世界上最重要的
<17-7,Phoebe>All right? If the most important thing on the planet to you...

360
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,400
<17-7,Phoebe>是猫拉屎之类的事情
<17-7,Phoebe>is this cat-poopy thing, then okay,

361
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,810
<17-7,Phoebe>那《臭臭猫》就送给你了
<17-7,Phoebe>you can have Smelly Cat.

362
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,600
<17-7,Phoebe>但我们以后再也不是搭档了
<17-7,Phoebe>But we won't be partners.

363
