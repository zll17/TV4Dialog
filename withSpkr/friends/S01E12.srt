<12-9,Phoebe>但是  关于我  有三件事你肯定知道

224
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,940
<12-9,Phoebe>第一  朋友是我生命中是最重要的
<12-9,Phoebe>One, my friends are the most important thing in my life,

225
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,290
<12-9,Phoebe>第二  我从不说谎
<12-9,Phoebe>two, I never lie,

226
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,860
<12-9,Phoebe>第三  我做的燕麦提子饼干全世界最好吃
<12-9,Phoebe>And three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

229
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,420
<12-10,Rachel>为什么我以前没吃过这些
<12-10,Rachel>why have I never tasted these before?!

230
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,150
<12-11,Phoebe>我不经常做  因为我觉得这样
<12-11,Phoebe>Oh, I don't make them a lot because

231
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,670
<12-11,Phoebe>对其他饼干来说并不公平
<12-11,Phoebe>I don't think it's fair to the other cookies.

232
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,140
<12-12,Rachel>好吧  你是对的
<12-12,Rachel>All right, well, you're right,

234
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,620
<12-13,Phoebe>-这也证明了我从不说谎  -我想是的
<12-13,Phoebe>- Which proves that I never lie. - I guess you don't.

235

250
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,300
<14-4,Rachel>我真太蠢了  我想起来那天和你们聊天
<14-4,Rachel>I feel so stupid! I think about the other day with you guys.

251
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,380
<14-4,Rachel>我还满口地说"保罗  他真棒
<14-4,Rachel>And I was all, "Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

252
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,660
<14-4,Rachel>他让我觉得怎样怎样"
<14-4,Rachel>he makes me feel so..."

255
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,470
<14-5,Phoebe>我才觉得尴尬
<14-5,Phoebe>I'm so embarrassed.

256
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,850
<14-5,Phoebe>他吃的是我的豆腐
<14-5,Phoebe>I'm the one he hit on.

257
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,640
<14-6,Rachel>菲比  如果我没遇见他
<14-6,Rachel>Pheebs, if I had never met him

258
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,930
<14-6,Rachel>这种事情就不会发生
<14-6,Rachel>this never would have happened.

259
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,160
<14-7,Rachel and Phoebe>-真对不起  -不  我对不起你
<14-7,Rachel and Phoebe>- I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry.

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,000
<14-9,Rachel>对  都怪那头猪
<14-9,Rachel>Right. He's the pig.

<14-11,Rachel>-真是猪  -天哪  他真是头猪
<14-11,Rachel>- Such a pig! - Oh, God, he's such a pig!

264
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,450
<14-12,Phoebe>他就像一只恶心的
<14-12,Phoebe>He's like a big disgusting pig...like a...

265
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,490
<14-14,Phoebe>-猪人 -没错  说得好
<14-14,Phoebe>- Pig...pig man! - Yes, good!

<14-15,Rachel>但这只猪人是我的男友
<14-15,Rachel>Oh, but he was my pig man...

267
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,940
<14-17,Rachel>为什么我都没看出来呢
<14-17,Rachel>How did I not see this?

268
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,560
<14-17,Rachel>哦 我知道
<14-17,Rachel>Oh, I know!

269
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,240

<14-18,Phoebe>It's because...

270
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,140
<14-18,Phoebe>他真的好帅
<14-18,Phoebe>... he's gorgeous,

271
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,920
<14-18,Phoebe>那么迷人
<14-18,Phoebe>and he's charming,

272

<14-20,Phoebe>说完了
<14-20,Phoebe>The end.

274
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,250
<14-21,Rachel>天啊
<14-21,Rachel>God.

275
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,810
<14-22,Phoebe>我应该瞒着你吗
<14-22,Phoebe>Should I not have told you?

276
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,500
<14-23,Rachel>不  相信我  还是最好让我知道
<14-23,Rachel>No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know.

277
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,960
<14-23,Rachel>我喜欢提前知道
<14-23,Rachel>Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,840
<15-1,Phoebe>我觉得她表现得很好
<15-1,Phoebe>I think she took it pretty well.

279
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,500
<15-1,Phoebe>保罗对她已经毫无意义了  所以
<15-1,Phoebe>You know Paolo's over there right now, so...

280
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,360
<15-2,Monica>我觉得咱们应该过去看看她现在怎么样
<15-2,Monica>We should get over there and see if she's okay.

281
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,400
<15-2,Monica>不过要  等一下
<15-2,Monica>Just one second.

282
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,010
<15-2,Monica>-得分  -比赛  走吧

<15-5,Ross>Come on, Pheebs.

284
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,420
<15-3,Ross>看起来我们打得你们屁滚尿流
<15-3,Ross>Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.

285
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,870
<15-4,Joey>不  是她打得我们屁滚尿流
<15-4,Joey>No-no, she kicked our butts.

286
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,560
<15-4,Joey>你只是奥林匹克运动会上的围观群众
<15-4,Joey>You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.

287
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,430
<15-5,Ross>得了吧  二对一
<15-5,Ross>Come on, two on one.

288
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,180
<15-6,Chandler>你为啥还在这里  她刚和那个男人分手
<15-6,Chandler>What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy,

289
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,340
<15-6,Chandler>这正是你趁虚而入的最佳时机
<15-6,Chandler>it's time for you to swoop in!

290
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,730
<15-7,Ross>什么  现在吗
<15-7,Ross>What, now?

291
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,540
<15-8,Joey>是的  现在正好趁虚而入
<15-8,Joey>Yes, now is when you swoop!

292
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,430
<15-8,Joey>你要确保当保罗出局之后
<15-8,Joey>You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there,

293
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,380
<15-8,Joey>你是瑞秋见到的第一个男人
<15-8,Joey>the first guy Rachel sees is you,

294
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,920
<15-8,Joey>她就会知道你的好  保罗的烂
<15-8,Joey>She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!

295
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,600
<15-8,Joey>你就像是  保罗反义词
<15-8,Joey>You're like, like the anti-Paolo!

296
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,020
<15-9,Chandler>我的天主教朋友是对的
<15-9,Chandler>My Catholic friend is right.

297
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,640
<15-9,Chandler>趁她心烦意乱  你陪伴佳人左右
<15-9,Chandler>She's distraught. You're there for her.

298
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,620
<15-9,Chandler>只要你能把握机遇  你就走向了罗斯时代
<15-9,Chandler>You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!

299
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,560
<15-9,Chandler>-看到了吧  -等一下  住手
<15-9,Chandler>- See this? See? - Hold it! Ascolta!

<15-9,Chandler>-怎么样了  -别看那边
<15-9,Chandler>- How's it going? - Don't stare.

301
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,010
<17-1,Ross>她刚从阳台上把他的衣服都扔完了
<17-1,Ross>Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony.

302
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,660
<17-2,Monica>现在正在比比划划
<17-2,Monica>Now there's gesturing and arm- waving.

303
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,140
<17-2,Monica>好的  可能是"你怎么可以这样"
<17-2,Monica>Ok, that is either, "How could you?"

304
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,640
<17-2,Monica>或是  "胸肌发达"
<17-2,Monica>or, "Enormous breasts!"

305
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,920
<17-2,Monica>他过来了
<17-2,Monica>Here he comes.

306

309
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,900
<17-6,Monica>保罗  虽然我很讨厌你对瑞秋的所作所为
<17-6,Monica>Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,

310
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,420
<17-6,Monica>但是我仍然有五份这东西
<17-6,Monica>but I still have five of these,

311
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,490
<17-6,Monica>用375度的高温直到干酪起泡泡就好
<17-6,Monica>so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.

312
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,020
<17-7,Paolo>谢谢
<17-7,Paolo>Grazie.

313
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,070
<17-8,Ross>保罗  我只是想告诉你
<17-8,Ross>Paolo, I-I just want to tell you

314
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,860
<17-8,Ross>并代表大家告诉你
<17-8,Ross>and I think I speak for everyone when I say...

<17-10,Ross>等等  我觉得咱们中只要去一个就够了
<17-10,Ross>Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there

317
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,270
<17-11,Monica>-免得她压力过大  -你说得对
<17-11,Monica>- ... so she's not overwhelmed. - Oh, you're right.

318
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,840
<17-12,Ross>而且我觉得应该是我去
<17-12,Ross>And I really think it should be me.

319
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,130
<18-3,Ross>你没事吧
<18-3,Ross>You all right?

325
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,540
<18-5,Ross>你应该找一个能明白
<18-5,Ross>...you should be with a guy who knows

326
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,780
<18-5,Ross>拥有你是多么幸福的人
<18-5,Ross>what he has when he has you.

<18-8,Rachel>我不想再找男人了
<18-8,Rachel>I don't want to look at another guy,

331
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,980
<18-8,Rachel>我也不想考虑别的男人
<18-8,Rachel>I don't want to think about another guy,

332
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,970
<18-8,Rachel>我甚至不想靠近任何一个男人
<18-8,Rachel>I don't even want to be near another guy.

333
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,190
<18-10,Rachel>罗斯  你真太好了

<19-6,Ross>See, Rach...

337
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,260
<19-6,Ross>我觉得发誓再不接近男人
<19-6,Ross>...  see, I don't think that

338
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,710
<19-6,Ross>不是个好方法  真的不这么认为
<19-6,Ross>swearing off guys altogether is the answer, I really don't.

339
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,470
<19-6,Ross>我认为你需要做的是
<19-6,Ross>I think that what you need is

340
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,420
<19-6,Ross>考虑一种更成熟的辨别方法
<19-6,Ross>to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

341
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,180
<19-7,Rachel>算了  我只想先单身一阵  明白吗
<19-7,Rachel>No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know?

<19-7,Rachel>不  不
<19-7,Rachel>No, no.

344
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,860
<19-8,Ross>听着  不是所有人都像保罗
<19-8,Ross>See,  because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
