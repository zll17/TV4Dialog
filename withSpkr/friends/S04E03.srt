00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,500
<1-5,Joey>有些完全没挤过
<1-5,Joey>And, some of it is not even popped!

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,510
<1-6,Chandler>我们真是白人垃圾
<1-6,Chandler>Could we be more white trash?

24
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,310
<2-1,Monica>我真是绝望透了
<2-1,Monica>How desperate am I?

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,850
<2-2,Rachel>还好钱德勒不在  谁也惨不过他
<2-2,Rachel>Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,350
<2-3,Monica>我刚答应帮我妈的宴会办外烩
<2-3,Monica>I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,820
<2-4,Phoebe>-为什么  -因为我需要钱
<2-4,Phoebe>-how come? -i need the money.

28
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,370
<2-5,Monica>而且这样正好可以抛开
<2-5,Monica>and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,720
<2-5,Monica>最后一丝自尊
<2-5,Monica>that last little schmidgen of self-respect.

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,660
<2-6,Ross>别这样  这是好事
<2-6,Ross>Come on, I think this is a good thing.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,730
<2-6,Ross>要不是觉得你行  妈不会找你
<2-6,Ross>I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,940
<2-7,Monica>你不必拍她马屁  她又听不到
<2-7,Monica>You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,520
<3-11,Rachel>我不懂  你上次跟她约会说她很无聊
<3-11,Rachel>I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a dud!

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,410
<3-12,Chandler>我太快下定论了  这次我们
<3-12,Chandler>Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able

45
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,550
<3-12,Chandler>可以进展到下一个阶段
<3-12,Chandler>we were able to take the relationship to the next level.

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,800
<3-13,Rachel>我上次差点被炒鱿鱼

<4-2,Monica>很顺利  乳酪火腿馅饼快好了
<4-2,Monica>Doing great, the quiches are coming along.

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,010
<4-3,Mrs. Geller>这是什么  蓝色指甲油
<4-3,Mrs. Geller>What's this? Blue nail polish?

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,170
<4-5,Mrs. Geller>你奶奶死后指甲就是这个颜色
<4-5,Mrs. Geller>Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,100
<4-6,Monica>我问你一个问题
<4-6,Monica>Let me ask you a question.

63
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,460
<4-8,Monica>你为什么找我
<4-8,Monica>Why did you hire me?

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,630
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>理查一直说他的派对餐点很棒
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party,

65
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,570
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>但你当时在跟他上床
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>of course you were sleeping with him.

66
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,110
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>后来我听说  那场同志婚礼的菜很好
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice,

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,210
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>你应该没跟那些人上床
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there.

68
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,710
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>至少你有点厨艺
<4-9,Mrs. Geller>Though, at least that would be something.

69
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,090
<4-10,Monica>天哪  你听到了
<4-10,Monica>Oh my God! Did you hear that?

70
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,980
<4-10,Monica>她是觉得我很行才找我
<4-10,Monica>She hired me because she thinks I'm good.

71
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,750
<4-11,Phoebe>我没听到这个
<4-11,Phoebe>Okay, I didn't hear that.

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,390
<4-12,Monica>她不是在可怜我
<4-12,Monica>Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity,

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,880
<4-12,Monica>不是想在朋友面前刁我
<4-12,Monica>it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends,

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,830
<4-12,Monica>是真的觉得我行
<4-12,Monica>she actually thinks I'm good.

75
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,640
<4-13,Phoebe>还有  如果你是同志就太酷了
<4-13,Phoebe>Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!

76
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,650
<5-1,The Salesman>午安  你是这里的家长吗
<5-1,The Salesman>Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,900
<5-5,The Salesman>我不是要买  我是要卖
<5-5,The Salesman>Actually, I'm not buying.I'm selling.

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,010
<5-5,The Salesman>问你一个问题
<5-5,The Salesman>Let me ask you one question.

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,910
<5-5,The Salesman>你是否曾在朋友们聊天时
<5-5,The Salesman>Do your friends ever have a conversation...

83
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,540
<5-5,The Salesman>而你只能跟着点头
<5-5,The Salesman>...and you just nod along,

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,970
<5-5,The Salesman>却搞不懂他们在说什么
<5-5,The Salesman>even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?

85
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,450
<6-1,Ross>告诉你  这根本是违宪
<6-1,Ross>I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.

86
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,280
<6-1,Ross>没错
<6-1,Ross>Oh yeah, I totally agree.

87
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,690
<6-1,Ross>我觉得他应该得诺贝尔奖
<6-1,Ross>I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

88
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,200
<6-1,Ross>才不是
<6-1,Ross>Nooo!!

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,530
<6-1,Ross>很像阿尔冈京族小孩的桌子
<6-1,Ross>It was like the algonquin kids' table.

90
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,200
<6-1,Ross>抱歉  对不起
<6-1,Ross>Excuse me. i'm sorry.

<8-1,Chandler>你发呆已经2分半钟
<8-1,Chandler>You haven't said anything for about two minutes.

92
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,340
<8-2,The Salesman>你到底有没有兴趣
<8-2,The Salesman>Are you at all interested?

<9-4,Monica>Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it

97
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,390
<9-4,Monica>我怕咬指甲被我妈念
<9-4,Monica>so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.

98
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,190
<9-5,Phoebe>我是说你现在只有九个指甲
<9-5,Phoebe>Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.

<9-7,Phoebe>I'm gonna go to the store,I'm gonna get you another set of nails,

105
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,070
<9-7,Phoebe>没有人会知道  你还是很美
<9-7,Phoebe>No one will know, and you'll look great!

106
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,710
<9-7,Phoebe>你是怕他们会吃到
<9-7,Phoebe>Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat? That's the problem.

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,190
<9-8,Mrs. Geller>女儿  别咬指甲
<9-8,Mrs. Geller>Honey, don't bite your nails.

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,930
<9-9,Monica>你先别发飙
<9-9,Monica>Okay ah, please don't freak out.

109
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,270
<9-9,Monica>不过某个馅饼里有一片假指甲
<9-9,Monica>Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups,

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,970
<9-9,Monica>而且无从找起
<9-9,Monica>and there's no way to know which one.

111
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,610
<9-10,Phoebe>找到的人可以中大奖
<9-10,Phoebe>And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!

112
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,350
<9-11,Mrs. Geller>我不会发飙
<9-11,Mrs. Geller>I'm not freaking out.

113
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,450
<9-13,Mrs. Geller>-那你笑什么  -没事  你爸输我5块钱
<9-13,Mrs. Geller>-why are you laughing? -It's nothing, it's just now your father owes me $5.

114
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,620
<9-14,Monica>你赌我会掉指甲
<9-14,Monica>What? You bet I'd lose a nail?

115
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,090
<9-15,Mrs. Geller>别傻了  我只是赌我会用上这个
<9-15,Mrs. Geller>Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these.

116
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,150
<9-16,Monica>冷冻千层面
<9-16,Monica>Frozen lasagnas?

117
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,960
<9-18,Monica>你赌我会搞砸
<9-18,Monica>You bet that I'd screw up?!

118
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,090
<9-18,Monica>你还说什么我很行
<9-18,Monica>So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...

119
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,730
<9-19,Mrs. Geller>不  那都是真的
<9-19,Mrs. Geller>No-no-no, that was all true.

120
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,630
<9-19,Mrs. Geller>只是怕你把自己推翻了
<9-19,Mrs. Geller>This was just in case you pulled a Monica.

121
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,810
<9-20,Monica>你答应过心理医生不再这么说
<9-20,Monica>You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.

122
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,010
<9-21,Mrs. Geller>拜托  有点幽默感
<9-21,Mrs. Geller>Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour,

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,640
<9-21,Mrs. Geller>你总是不懂得自嘲
<9-21,Mrs. Geller>you've never been able to laugh at yourself.

124
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,110
<9-21,Mrs. Geller>是啊
<9-21,Mrs. Geller>That's right.

125
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,980
<9-22,Monica>我妈对我没信心  好好笑
<9-22,Monica>My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

126
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,620
<9-23,Phoebe>哪里好笑
<9-23,Phoebe>I don't get it.

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,120
<9-24,Mrs. Geller>不  我对你有信心
<9-24,Mrs. Geller>No, I have faith...

128
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,120
<9-25,Monica>不  你有的是千层面
<9-25,Monica>No! You have lasagnas!

129
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,430
<9-27,Phoebe>毁掉的馅饼好了
<9-27,Phoebe>Op, the ruined quiches are ready.

130
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,890
<10-1,Chandler>我们不该  这不像分手
<10-1,Chandler>It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,800
<10-2,Joanna>是分手  我好伤心
