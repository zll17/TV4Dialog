1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,650
<1-1,Monica>你们男生不懂的是
<1-1,Monica>What you guys don't understand is,

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,080
<1-1,Monica>接吻对女生的重要性
<1-1,Monica>for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,670
<1-2,Joey>是嘛
<1-2,Joey>Yeah, right!...

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,450
<1-2,Joey>当真吗
<1-2,Joey>Y'serious?

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,460
<1-3,Phoebe>当然
<1-3,Phoebe>Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,060
<1-4,Rachel>初吻可以让人明白一切
<1-4,Rachel>Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,120
<1-5,Monica>没错
<1-5,Monica>Absolutely.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,190
<1-6,Chandler>对我们而言
<1-6,Chandler>Yeah, I think for us,

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,470
<1-6,Chandler>接吻就像是暖场序幕
<1-6,Chandler>kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know?

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,900
<1-6,Chandler>就像平克·弗洛伊德出场前
<1-6,Chandler>I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,850
<1-6,Chandler>你得耐着性子先看完暖场搞笑秀
<1-6,Chandler>before Pink Floyd comes out.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,000
<1-7,Ross>对  而且  我们并非
<1-7,Ross>Yeah, and-and it's not that

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,780
<1-7,Ross>讨厌搞笑表演  而是因为
<1-7,Ross>we don't like the comedian, it's that-that...

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,710
<1-7,Ross>只是我们买票又不是为了看搞笑秀
<1-7,Ross>that's not why we bought the ticket.

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,730
<1-8,Chandler>问题在于演唱会结束后
<1-8,Chandler>The problem is, though, after the concert's over,

17
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,450
<1-8,Chandler>不论表演有多精采
<1-8,Chandler>no matter how great the show was,

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,380
<1-8,Chandler>你们女生总还想再重温暖场搞笑秀
<1-8,Chandler>you girls are always looking for the comedian again, you know?

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,400
<1-8,Chandler>我们在车中奋力杀出车阵
<1-8,Chandler>I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic...basically

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,290
<1-8,Chandler>只是拼命让自己别睡着
<1-8,Chandler>just trying to stay awake.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,280
<1-9,Rachel>是哦  给你个建议  让搞笑秀返场
<1-9,Rachel>Yeah, well, word of advice:Bring back the comedian.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,870
<1-9,Rachel>否则下次你们只能坐在家里
<1-9,Rachel>Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,000
<1-9,Rachel>独自一人听唱片
<1-9,Rachel>sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

24
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,020
<1-10,Joey>我们现在还在谈论性吗
<1-10,Joey>...Are we still talking about sex?

41
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,630
<2-1,Ross>不  挺好的  只是
<2-1,Ross>No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- Mm-

42
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,250
<2-1,Ross>她看起来是不是有点生气啊
<2-1,Ross>doesn't she seem a little angry?

43
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,560
<2-2,Marsha>那是因为她有问题了
<2-2,Marsha>Well, she has issues.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,320
<2-3,Ross>真的吗
<2-3,Ross>Does she?

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,400
<2-4,Marsha>她男人在外头拿着大棒敲昏别的女人
<2-4,Marsha>He's out banging other women over the head with a club,

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,920
<2-4,Marsha>而她却得在家
<2-4,Marsha>while she sits at home trying to

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,550
<2-4,Marsha>努力清除地毯上乳齿象的臭味
<2-4,Marsha>get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,530
<2-5,Ross>玛莎  他们是原始人
<2-5,Ross>Marsha, these are cave people.

49
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,030
<2-5,Ross>明白吗  他们关心的问题应该是
<2-5,Ross>Okay? They have issues like

50
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,470
<2-5,Ross>"嘿  冰川时代离我们越来越近了"
<2-5,Ross>'Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.'

51
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,420
<2-6,Marsha>-懂吗  -谈到问题  那不是你前妻吗
<2-6,Marsha>- See?  - Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

52
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,430
<2-7,Ross>我  不是
<2-7,Ross>Me? No.

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,830
<2-8,Marsha>正是  卡罗尔  你好
<2-8,Marsha>Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

55
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,970
<2-8,Marsha>好吧  是的
<2-8,Marsha>Okay.Yes.Yes,it is.

56
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,310
<2-9,Ross>咱们到冰河世纪那边见好吗
<2-9,Ross>How about I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age?

57
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,510
<2-10,Carol>你的气色好极了  我
<2-10,Carol>You look great. I, uh...

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,550
<2-11,Ross>虽然我很不喜欢
<2-11,Ross>I hate that.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,490
<2-12,Carol>抱歉  谢了  你看起来也不错
<2-12,Carol>Sorry. thanks.You look good too.

60
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,800
<2-13,Ross>在这儿任何直立的人
<2-13,Ross>Ah, well, in here, anyone who...stands erect...

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,360
<2-13,Ross>最近怎么样  还是
<2-13,Ross>So what's new? Still, uh...

62
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:28,980
<2-14,Carol>女同性恋
<2-14,Carol>A lesbian?

63
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,540
<2-15,Ross>世事难料嘛  那么
<2-15,Ross>Well...you never know. How's, um...

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,800
<2-15,Ross>家庭生活如何
<2-15,Ross>how's the family?

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,780
<2-16,Carol>玛蒂的疑心病还是很重  还有
<2-16,Carol>Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-

66
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,170
<2-17,Ross>卡罗尔  你来找我有什么事
<2-17,Ross>Why- why are you here, Carol?

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,940
<2-18,Carol>我怀孕了
<2-18,Carol>I'm pregnant.

68
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,480
<2-19,Ross>怀孕
<2-19,Ross>Pregnant?!

69
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,670
<2-19,Ross>她似乎不急着离开
<2-19,Ross>she didn't leave in such a hurry after all

70
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,780
<3-1,Chandler>我猜这是《三人行》里
<3-1,Chandler>Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,040
<3-1,Chandler>他们有误会的那集
<3-1,Chandler>there's some kind of misunderstanding.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,490
<3-1,Chandler>那我果真看过这一集
<3-1,Chandler>...Then I've already seen this one!

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,580
<3-2,Monica>喝完没
<3-2,Monica>Are you through with that?

74
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,240
<3-3,Joey>真不好意思  我咽得太慢了
<3-3,Joey>Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

75
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,240
<3-4,Monica>这是谁的小纸团
<3-4,Monica>Whose little ball of paper is this?!

76
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,800
<3-5,Chandler>应该是我的  我写给自己一张便条
<3-5,Chandler>Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself,

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,390
<3-5,Chandler>后来觉得不需要  于是将它揉成纸团
<3-5,Chandler>and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...

78
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,360
<3-5,Chandler>于是我现在不想活了
<3-5,Chandler>...now I wish I was dead.

79
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,520
<3-6,Phoebe>那个枕头她已经拍过了
<3-6,Phoebe>She's already fluffed that pillow...

80
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,620
<3-6,Phoebe>莫妮卡  你已经拍过了枕头了  算了
<3-6,Phoebe>Monica, you know,you've already fluffed that--but, it's fine!

81
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,470
<3-7,Monica>抱歉各位
<3-7,Monica>Look , I'm sorry, guys,

82
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,020
<3-7,Monica>我只是不想给他们任何
<3-7,Monica>I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition

83
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,170
<3-7,Monica>借题发挥的机会
<3-7,Monica>than they already have.

84
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,040
<3-8,Chandler>没错  众所周知父母对孩子的枕头
<3-8,Chandler>Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,130
<3-8,Chandler>要求有多苛刻
<3-8,Chandler>about the flatness of a child's pillow.

86
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,270
<3-9,Phoebe>莫妮卡
<3-9,Phoebe>Monica? Hi!

87
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,630
<3-9,Phoebe>莫妮卡  你吓到我了
<3-9,Phoebe>Um, Monica, you're scaring me.

88
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,180
<3-9,Phoebe>我是说  你现在一副慌张失措的样子
<3-9,Phoebe>I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly.

89
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,450
<3-9,Phoebe>而且显得不是很好
<3-9,Phoebe>And not-not in a good way.

90
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,960
<3-10,Joey>对啊  放轻松
<3-10,Joey>Yeah, calm down.

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,710
<3-10,Joey>每次他们来时从没见
<3-10,Joey>You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,730
<3-10,Joey>罗斯露出慌张的样子
<3-10,Joey>twirly every time they come.

93
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,560
<3-11,Monica>因为在我爸妈心目中  罗斯不可能犯错
<3-11,Monica>That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

94
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,860
<3-11,Monica>他是个王子
<3-11,Monica>Y'see, he's the Prince.

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,190
<3-11,Monica>显然  他们在我出生前有个大型仪式
<3-11,Monica>Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.

96
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,660
<3-13,Monica>什么
<3-13,Monica>What?

97
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,380
<3-14,Chandler>丑裸男搞了个健腿器
<3-14,Chandler>Ugly Naked Guy got a thigh-master!

98
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,290
<3-16,Rachel>有人见我订婚戒指了吗
<3-16,Rachel>Has anybody seen my engagement ring?

99
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,040
<3-17,Phoebe>有  挺漂亮的
<3-17,Phoebe>Yeah, it's beautiful.

100
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,330
<3-18,Rachel>天哪  天哪  天哪  天哪
<3-18,Rachel>Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God, Oh God.

101
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,110
<3-19,Phoebe>嘿  不要动它们
<3-19,Phoebe>No, look, don't touch that!

102
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,020
<3-20,Rachel>还嫌我现在不够恐慌害怕吗
<3-20,Rachel>Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough,

103
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,000
<3-20,Rachel>明天就得还他戒指了
<3-20,Rachel>having to give it back to him...

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,040
<3-20,Rachel>巴瑞  记得我不  我是那个身穿婚纱
<3-20,Rachel>'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,990
<3-20,Rachel>当着你全家人的面让你颜面无存的女孩
<3-20,Rachel>who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!'

106
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,750
<3-20,Rachel>天啊  如今我要去把戒指还给他
<3-20,Rachel>Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring,

107
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,360
<3-20,Rachel>结果戒指没了  这是要逼死我啊
<3-20,Rachel>without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

108
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,710
<3-21,Monica>别急  瑞秋  我们会找到的  对不
<3-21,Monica>Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!

109

110
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,940
<3-23,Joey>最后一次戴是在什么时候
<3-23,Joey>Alright, when do you have it on last?

111
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,770
<3-24,Phoebe>呆子  大概是在丢失之前咯
<3-24,Phoebe>Doy! Probably right before she lost it!

112
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,280
<3-25,Chandler>这年头说"呆子"的人还真不多
<3-25,Chandler>You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,680
<3-26,Rachel>我今天早上还戴着呢
<3-26,Rachel>I know I had it this morning,

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,640
<3-26,Rachel>我记得当时我正在厨房
<3-26,Rachel>and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,640
<3-27,Chandler>和黛娜一起吗
<3-27,Chandler>...Dinah?

<3-31,Monica>I gave you one job!

120
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,390
<3-32,Rachel>不过这面条煮得还真直
<3-32,Rachel>Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

121
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,750
<3-33,Chandler>莫妮卡  你明白的
<3-33,Chandler>Now, Monica, you know that's not

122
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,530
<3-33,Chandler>在千层面中找订婚戒指不是这个样子找的
<3-33,Chandler>how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

123
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,300
<3-34,Monica>我  办不到
<3-34,Monica>I just...can't do it.

124
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,820
<3-35,Chandler>伙计们  动手吧
<3-35,Chandler>Boys? We're going in.

125
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,780
<3-37,Monica>听语气不怎么开心啊
<3-37,Monica>Wow. That is not a happy hi.

126
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,370
<3-38,Ross>卡罗尔怀孕了
<3-38,Ross>Carol's pregnant.

<3-40,Monica>W-w-wh-...wha-...w-w-w-...

129
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,680
<3-41,Ross>保持这个状态两小时
<3-41,Ross>Yeah. Do that for another two hours,

130
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,380
<3-41,Ross>你就会变成我现在这样了
<3-41,Ross>you might be where I am right about now.

131
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,130
<3-42,Chandler>如此一来  就不用操心枕头的事了对吧
<3-42,Chandler>Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

132
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,480
<3-43,Rachel>那现在  你现在要怎么办
<3-43,Rachel>Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?

133
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,870
<3-44,Ross>卡罗尔说她和苏珊想让我也参与进来
<3-44,Ross>Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved,

134
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,420
<3-44,Ross>但是我对此感觉很不自在  我不想掺和
<3-44,Ross>but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved...

135
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,030
<3-44,Ross>一切由我做决定
<3-44,Ross>basically it's totally up to me.

136
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,560
<3-45,Phoebe>她人好好  我真想念她
<3-45,Phoebe>She is so great! I miss her.

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,840
<3-46,Monica>她所谓的"参与"是什么意思
<3-46,Monica>What does she mean by 'involved'?

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,930
<3-47,Chandler>我觉得  最大部分的工作你已经完成了
<3-47,Chandler>I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

139
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,380
<3-48,Ross>总之  她们要我明天一起去
<3-48,Ross>Anyway, they want me to go down to this-

140
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,900
<3-48,Ross>做超声波检查
<3-48,Ross>sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

141
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,410
<3-49,Rachel>你打算怎么做
<3-49,Rachel>So what are you gonna do?

142
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,620
<3-50,Ross>我也不知道
<3-50,Ross>I have no idea.

143
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,080
<3-50,Ross>不管我怎么做  我都要当爸爸了
<3-50,Ross>No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.

144
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,460
<3-51,Joey>面已经被搅乱了  不是吗
<3-51,Joey>...Well, this is still ruined, right?

145
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,650
<3-52,Mrs. Geller>玛莎·卢德文的女儿会打电话给你
<3-52,Mrs. Geller>Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.

146
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,900
<3-52,Mrs. Geller>怎么会有咖哩味
<3-52,Mrs. Geller>Mmm! What's that curry taste?

147
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,570
<3-53,Monica>那就是咖喱
<3-53,Monica>Curry.

148
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,480
<3-55,Ross>我觉得挺很好吃  真的
<3-55,Ross>I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

149
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,850
<3-56,Mr. Geller>你还记得卢德文一家人吗
<3-56,Mr. Geller>Do you remember the Ludwins?

150
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,070
<3-56,Mr. Geller>他家的大女儿挺喜欢你   对不
<3-56,Mr. Geller>The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

151
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,690
<3-57,Mrs. Geller>他们家的女儿都喜欢他
<3-57,Mrs. Geller>They all had a thing for him.

152
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,960
<3-58,Ross>别这样  妈
<3-58,Ross>Aw, Mom...

153
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,350
<3-59,Monica>抱歉  她为何要打电话给我
<3-59,Monica>I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

154
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,630
<3-60,Mrs. Geller>她刚毕业  想找份烹饪的工作
<3-60,Mrs. Geller>Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking,

155
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,320
<3-60,Mrs. Geller>或是做饭啥的  我也不清楚
<3-60,Mrs. Geller>or food, or...I don't know.

156
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,710
<3-60,Mrs. Geller>总之  我告诉她你开了一家餐馆
<3-60,Mrs. Geller>Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-

157
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,220
<3-61,Monica>不  妈  我没开餐馆
<3-61,Monica>No Mom, I don't have a restaurant,

158
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,830
<3-61,Monica>我是在餐厅工作
<3-61,Monica>I work in a restaurant.

159
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,570
<3-62,Mrs. Geller>他们不需要知道这个
<3-62,Mrs. Geller>Well, they don't have to know that...

160
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,920
<3-63,Monica>罗斯  能过来帮我做意大利面吗
<3-63,Monica>Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

161
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,920
<3-64,Ross>-好  -我们要吃意大利面呀
<3-64,Ross>- Yeah. - Oh, we're having spaghetti!

162
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,200
<3-65,Mrs. Geller>太简单了
<3-65,Mrs. Geller>That's...easy.

163
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,890
<3-66,Monica>我知道这样要求过于自私
<3-66,Monica>I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish,

164
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,960
<3-66,Monica>你能提一下孩子和女同性恋的事吗
<3-66,Monica>but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,520
<3-66,Monica>因为那样好歹能让我稍稍喘口气
<3-66,Monica>Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

166
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,220
<3-67,Mrs. Geller>瑞秋最近闯了那么大的祸
<3-67,Mrs. Geller>What that Rachel did to her life...

167
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,020
<3-67,Mrs. Geller>我们在俱乐部遇见她父母
<3-67,Mrs. Geller>We ran into her parents at the club,

168
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,080
<3-67,Mrs. Geller>他们很不开心
<3-67,Mrs. Geller>they were not playing very well.

169
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,780
<3-68,Mr. Geller>我不会告诉你他们为婚礼耗费了多少钱
<3-68,Mr. Geller>I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding...

170
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,650
<3-68,Mr. Geller>但是四万块可是不少钱呢
<3-68,Mr. Geller>but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!

171
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,860
<3-69,Mrs. Geller>至少她曾拥有过把男人丢在教堂圣坛的机会
<3-69,Mrs. Geller>Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...

172
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,400
<3-70,Monica>这话算什么意思
<3-70,Monica>What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,280
<3-71,Mrs. Geller>没什么  表达一下亲情
<3-71,Mrs. Geller>Nothing! It's an expression.

174
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,580
<3-72,Monica>不  才不是呢
<3-72,Monica>No, it's not.

175
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,790
<3-73,Mr. Geller>别听你妈的
<3-73,Mr. Geller>Don't listen to your mother.

176
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,080
<3-73,Mr. Geller>你独立自主  而且一直都这么独
<3-73,Mr. Geller>You're independent, and you always have been!

177
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,530
<3-73,Mr. Geller>就连你小时候也一样
<3-73,Mr. Geller>Even when you were a kid...

178
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,630
<3-73,Mr. Geller>那时你胖嘟嘟  一个朋友也没有
<3-73,Mr. Geller>and you were chubby, and you had no friends,

179
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,610
<3-73,Mr. Geller>你还是活得好好的
<3-73,Mr. Geller>you were just fine!

180
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,190
<3-73,Mr. Geller>你会独自待在自己房间里看书  玩拼图
<3-73,Mr. Geller>And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...

181
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,010
<3-74,Mr. Geller>而像罗斯这种人却注定要做人中之龙的
<3-74,Mr. Geller>Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars,

182
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,040
<3-74,Mr. Geller>在博物馆工作  发表论文
<3-74,Mr. Geller>with his museum, and his papers getting published.

183
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,430
<3-74,Mr. Geller>其他人则安逸于现状
<3-74,Mr. Geller>Other people are satisfied with staying where they are-

184
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,870
<3-74,Mr. Geller>告诉你  这些人绝不会得癌症哦
<3-74,Mr. Geller>I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.

185
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,120
<3-75,Mr. Geller>我曾读过一些女性也试图想拥有一切
<3-75,Mr. Geller>...And I read about these women trying to have it all,

186
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,060
<3-75,Mr. Geller>幸好咱家的小莫妮卡完全没有这种烦恼
<3-75,Mr. Geller>and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.

187
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,020
<3-76,Monica>罗斯  你最近怎么样
<3-76,Monica>So, Ross, what's going on with you?

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,260
<3-76,Monica>有啥情况吗
<3-76,Monica>Any stories?

189
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,080
<3-76,Monica>没有新闻八卦之类能和爸妈分享一下吗
<3-76,Monica>No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,550
<3-76,Monica>好吧  好吧
<3-76,Monica>Okay! Okay.

191
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,120
<3-77,Ross>听着  我明白
<3-77,Ross>Look, I, uh- I realise

<3-77,Ross>你们一直想知道
<3-77,Ross>you guys have been wondering

193
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,080
<3-77,Ross>我和卡罗尔之间倒底出了什么事
<3-77,Ross>what exactly happened between Carol and me, and,

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,030
<3-77,Ross>事情是这样的
<3-77,Ross>so, well, here's the deal.

195
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,660
<3-77,Ross>卡罗尔是同性恋
<3-77,Ross>Carol's a lesbian.

196
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,560
<3-77,Ross>她现在和一个叫苏珊的女人住在一起
<3-77,Ross>She's living with a woman named Susan.

197
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,990
<3-77,Ross>她还怀了我的孩子
<3-77,Ross>She's pregnant with my child,

198
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,350
<3-77,Ross>并打算和苏珊共同抚养
<3-77,Ross>and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.

199
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,930
<3-78,Mrs. Geller>这些你居然全都知道
<3-78,Mrs. Geller>And you knew about this?!

200
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,170
<4-1,Joey>你的爸妈真的很不怎么样啊
<4-1,Joey>Your folks are really that bad, huh?

201
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,350
<4-2,Ross>你要知道他们特别专业
<4-2,Ross>Well, y'know, these people are pros.

<4-2,Ross>他们运筹帷幄
<4-2,Ross>They know what they're doing,

203
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,390
<4-2,Ross>慢慢部署  最后总能达到目的
<4-2,Ross>they take their time, they get the job done.

204
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,390
<4-3,Monica>常言道  父母是无法交换的
<4-3,Monica>Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,...

205
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,780
<4-3,Monica>如果可以  我要你的父母

<4-4,Ross>Must pee.

207
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,030
<4-5,Phoebe>如果你是双胞胎  情况会更惨
<4-5,Phoebe>Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

208
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,410
<4-7,Phoebe>-你是双胞胎  -对  我们不往来
<4-7,Phoebe>- You're twins? - Yeah. We don't speak.

<4-7,Phoebe>她是那种精力充沛  事业心强的人
<4-7,Phoebe>She's like this high-powered, driven career type.

<4-8,Chandler>她从事什么工作

<4-14,Ross>...How long was I in there?

219
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,490
<4-15,Rachel>我在做打扫
<4-15,Rachel>I'm just cleaning up.

<4-17,Rachel>Uh...okay, sure! Thanks!

222
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,070
<4-18,Ross>总之
<4-18,Ross>Anyway...um...

223
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,480
<4-18,Ross>明天要见巴瑞  紧张吗
<4-18,Ross>So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

224
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,730
<4-19,Rachel>有一点
<4-19,Rachel>Oh...a little...

225
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,900
<4-20,Ross>很紧张
<4-20,Ross>A lot.

226
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,610
<4-22,Ross>有什么建议吗
<4-22,Ross>So, got any advice?

227
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,560
<4-23,Rachel>作为一个刚刚被甩的人
<4-23,Rachel>Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?

228
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,450
<4-24,Ross>你应该避免用"甩"这个字眼
<4-24,Ross>Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word'dumped'.

229
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,380
<4-24,Ross>因为现在他很有可能正痛不欲生
<4-24,Ross>Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know,

230
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,350
<4-24,Ross>而你也不该显得如此光艳照人
<4-24,Ross>so you should try not to look too terrific,

231
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,380
<4-24,Ross>我知道这一点很难做到
<4-24,Ross>I know it'll be hard.

232
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,470
<4-24,Ross>这样吧  我替你去一趟
<4-24,Ross>Or, y'know, uh, hey! I'll go down there,

233
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,590
<4-24,Ross>把巴瑞的戒指还给他
<4-24,Ross>and I'll give Barry back his ring,

234
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,810
<4-24,Ross>你陪卡罗尔和苏珊去做产科检查
<4-24,Ross>and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

235
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,340
<4-25,Rachel>你明天得见卡罗尔
<4-25,Rachel>Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow...

236
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,720
<4-25,Rachel>为什么会变得这么复杂啊
<4-25,Rachel>When did it get so complicated?

237
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
<4-26,Ross>问倒我了
<4-26,Ross>Got me.

238
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,220
<4-27,Rachel>-还记得我们在高中时吗  -记得
<4-27,Rachel>- Remember when we were in high school together? - Yeah.

239
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,050
<4-28,Ross>那时我们难道不都认为自己会遇见一个人
<4-28,Ross>I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone,

240
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,220
<4-29,Rachel>坠入爱河  然后厮守终生吗
<4-29,Rachel>fall in love- and that'd be it?

241
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,970
<4-30,Ross>-罗斯  -对  没错
<4-30,Ross>- Ross?  - Yes, yes!

242
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,580
<4-31,Rachel>没想到自己会沦落到这个地步
<4-31,Rachel>Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here...

243
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,450
<4-32,Ross>我也是
<4-32,Ross>Me either...

244
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,230
<5-1,Ross>抱歉  我迟到了  工作太忙
<5-1,Ross>Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work.

245
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,610
<5-1,Ross>忙着处理巨型恐龙什么的
<5-1,Ross>There was this big dinosaur...thing...anyway.

246
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,130
<5-3,Carol>罗斯  记得苏珊吗
<5-3,Carol>Ross, you remember Susan.

247

<8-2,Ross>Helen Geller?

322
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,430
<8-2,Ross>我不同意
<8-2,Ross>I don't think so.

323
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,780
<8-3,Carol>-她不会叫海伦·盖勒的  -谢谢
<8-3,Carol>- It's not gonna be Helen Geller. - Thank you!

324
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,870
<8-5,Carol>不  我是说她不姓盖勒
<8-5,Carol>No, I mean it's not Geller.

325
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,540
<8-6,Ross>难道她叫海伦·威利克
<8-6,Ross>What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

326
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
<8-7,Carol>不  老实说
<8-7,Carol>No, actually, um,

327
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,160
<8-7,Carol>我们考虑用海伦·威利克·班奇
<8-7,Carol>we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

328
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,150
<8-8,Ross>等等  为何名字里有她的份
<8-8,Ross>Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?

329
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,810
<8-9,Susan>因为她也是我的孩子
<8-9,Susan>It's my baby too.

330
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,750
<8-10,Ross>真搞笑啊  我不记得你也贡献了精子
<8-10,Ross>Oh, so funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

331
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,460
<8-11,Susan>我们都知道那是个极大的挑战
<8-11,Susan>Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!

332
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,040
<8-12,Carol>够了  你们两个  别吵了
<8-12,Carol>All right, you two, stop it!

333
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,430
<8-13,Ross>不  功劳全让她抢了
<8-13,Ross>No no no, she gets a credit,

334
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,210
<8-13,Ross>拜托  我也是当事人好吗
<8-13,Ross>hey, I'm in there too.

335
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,470
<8-14,Carol>罗斯  你该不会想用
<8-14,Carol>Ross. You're not actually suggesting

336
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,910
<8-14,Carol>海伦·威利克·班奇·盖勒吧
<8-14,Carol>Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?

337
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,880
<8-14,Carol>因为我觉得这样很像虐待儿童
<8-14,Carol>Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

338
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,020
<8-15,Ross>当然没有
<8-15,Ross>Of course not,

339
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,040
<8-15,Ross>我想用盖勒·威利克·班奇
<8-15,Ross>I'm...suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

340
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,550
<8-16,Susan>不行  不行不行不行
<8-16,Susan>Oh, no, nonononono,

341
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,470
<8-16,Susan>你看出他的心思了吗
<8-16,Susan>you see what he's doing?

342
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,310
<8-16,Susan>他知道没人会叫全名的
<8-16,Susan>He knows no-one's gonna say all those names,

343
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,400
<8-16,Susan>这样大家只会叫她盖勒  他就此得逞
<8-16,Susan>so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!

344
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,660
<8-17,Ross>我得逞  你认为这样算得逞
<8-17,Ross>My way?! You-you think this is my way?

345
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,060
<8-17,Ross>相信我  我这辈子都没想到
<8-17,Ross>Believe me, of all the ways

346
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,460
<8-17,Ross>自己会沦落到这步田地
<8-17,Ross>I ever imagined this moment in my life being,

347
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,600
<8-17,Ross>这不是我想要的好吗
<8-17,Ross>this is not my way- y'know what?

348
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,750
<8-17,Ross>这太难了  我不行  我做不到
<8-17,Ross>Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

349
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,050
<8-18,Dr. Oberman>有人在吗  今天如何  想呕吐吗
<8-18,Dr. Oberman>Knock knock! How are we today? Any nausea?

350
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,110
<8-19,All>-一点点  -想吐  -有点儿吧
<8-19,All>- A little. - Yeah. - Yeah.

351
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,260
<8-20,Dr. Oberman>好吧  我只是想问问准妈妈
<8-20,Dr. Oberman>Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be,

352
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,920
<8-20,Dr. Oberman>不过  谢谢你们这么配合
<8-20,Dr. Oberman>but...thanks for sharing.

00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,120
<8-20,Dr. Oberman>躺好

354
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,880
<8-21,Ross>那个  我准备走了
<8-21,Ross>You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go.

355
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,220
<8-21,Ross>这件事太不寻常了
<8-21,Ross>I don't- I don't think I can be involved

356
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,770
<8-21,Ross>我觉得自己没办法参与进来
<8-21,Ross>in this particular thing right now.

357
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,480
<8-22,Ross>我的天啊
<8-22,Ross>Oh, my God.

358
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,960
<8-23,Susan>看啊
<8-23,Susan>Look at that.

360
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,550

<9-1,Ross>Well? Isn't that amazing?

361
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,840
<9-2,Joey>我们应该看到什么
<9-2,Joey>What are we supposed to be seeing here?

362
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,160
<9-3,Chandler>我不知道  不过
<9-3,Chandler>I don't know, but...

364
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,200
<9-3,Chandler>我觉得它似乎马上要去攻击企业号
