00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,810
<1-1,PHOEBE>丑裸男在装饰他的树
<1-1,PHOEBE>Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,150
<1-1,PHOEBE>天啊  你们真该瞧瞧他圣诞球的大小
<1-1,PHOEBE>Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,000
<1-3,CHANDLER>你们今年给管理员多少红包
<1-3,CHANDLER>How much did you tip the super this year?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,090
<1-4,RACHEL>是这样  我们打算给50
<1-4,RACHEL>Yeah, we were gonna give fifty,

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,340
<1-6,CHANDLER>不过我们不想显得比你们小气
<1-6,CHANDLER>but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,700
<1-7,MONICA>今年我们准备送他自己做的饼干
<1-7,MONICA>Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,000
<1-9,JOEY>你们送他饼干
<1-9,JOEY>You gave them cookies?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,820
<1-10,MONICA>给钱太见外了
<1-10,MONICA>Money is so impersonal.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,140
<1-10,MONICA>饼干能表达我们对他的关心
<1-10,MONICA>Cookies says someone really cares.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,930
<1-10,MONICA>好吧  我们没钱  但饼干真能表达那层意思
<1-10,MONICA>Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,230
<1-11,PHOEBE>我了解
<1-11,PHOEBE>I can see that.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,420
<1-11,PHOEBE>曾有盘布朗尼对我念过打油诗
<1-11,PHOEBE>A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,980
<1-12,CHANDLER>菲比  问你个事  那些是"搞怪"布朗尼吗
<1-12,CHANDLER>Pheebs, let me ask you something. Were these "funny" brownies?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,880
<1-13,PHOEBE>不算吧
<1-13,PHOEBE>Not especially.

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,710
<1-13,PHOEBE>不过我觉得里面放了大麻
<1-13,PHOEBE>But I think they had pot in them.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
<1-14,ROSS>两位  你们还送了谁饼干
<1-14,ROSS>So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,090
<1-15,RACHEL>邮差  管理员
<1-15,RACHEL>The mailman, the super....

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,490

<1-16,MONICA>And the newspaper delivery guy.

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,360
<1-17,JOEY>天呐

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,880
<1-18,RACHEL>怎么了
<1-18,RACHEL>What?

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,450
<1-19,JOEY>你们可能看到会不开心
<1-19,JOEY>I don't think you're not gonna like this.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,270
<1-20,RACHEL>天呐  这些饼干在运动版被碾碎了
<1-20,RACHEL>Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,340
<1-21,MONICA>看  他还把我的字谜给做了
<1-21,MONICA>Look. He did my crossword puzzle.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,770
<1-22,ROSS>对  但是错误百出
<1-22,ROSS>Yeah, but not very well,

26
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,310
<1-22,ROSS>除非横十四的"格什温音乐剧"
<1-22,ROSS>unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,660
<1-22,ROSS>是叫"咬我  咬我  咬我"
<1-22,ROSS>...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me."

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,460
<2-1,JOEY>真不敢相信这就到圣诞节了
<2-1,JOEY>I can't believe it's Christmas already.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,010
<2-1,JOEY>我们才刚吃完了感恩火鸡  一转眼
<2-1,JOEY>One day you're eating turkey, the next thing you know...

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,280
<2-1,JOEY>就该唱"跳跃的男人"和"生蛋的鹅"了
<2-1,JOEY>your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.

49
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,090
<2-2,CHANDLER>所以每年这个时候  鹅才会感到如释重负
<2-2,CHANDLER>Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.

50

<3-8,GRANDMOTHER>他帮一个小男孩放风筝
<3-8,GRANDMOTHER>And helping a little boy fly a kite.

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,610
<3-8,GRANDMOTHER>这一张是他参加毕业典礼

116
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,820
<3-8,GRANDMOTHER>还是毕业照
<3-8,GRANDMOTHER>Another graduation.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,040
<3-9,PHOEBE>他真的是我爸吗
<3-9,PHOEBE>Is this really my father?

118
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,180
<3-10,GRANDMOTHER>他真的是你爸
<3-10,GRANDMOTHER>Is it really your fa?

119
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,340
<3-10,GRANDMOTHER>天呐  当然是了
<3-10,GRANDMOTHER>Oh, god. Well, of course it is.

120
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,950
<3-11,PHOEBE>气氛不对啊  我看有人在说谎
<3-11,PHOEBE>I smell smoke. Maybe because someone's pants are on fire!

121
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,100
<3-13,PHOEBE>我从出生到现在
<3-13,PHOEBE>In all the years we've been grandmother and granddaughter...

122
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,650
<3-13,PHOEBE>你从没对我撒过谎
<3-13,PHOEBE>...you've never lied to me.

123
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,430
<3-14,GRANDMOTHER>好吧  他不是你爸爸  他只是一个相框模特
<3-14,GRANDMOTHER>All right, that's not your father. It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

124
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,620
<3-15,PHOEBE>天啊
<3-15,PHOEBE>Oh, God.

125
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,020
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>那是你妈的主意
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>It was your mother's idea.

126
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,550
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>她不想让你知道谁是你爸
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>She didn't want you to know your real father...

127
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,590
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>因为他的离开把你妈的心给伤透了
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>... because he hurt her so much when he left.

128
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,540
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>我也不想跟着骗你
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>I didn't want to go wrong with her.

129
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,190
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>可是她死了  那样跟她争就更难了
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>But then she died and it was harder to argue with her.

130
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,120
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>不是不可能  只是更难
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>Not impossible, but harder.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,060
<3-17,PHOEBE>那他就不是一个有名的树医
<3-17,PHOEBE>All right. So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

132
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,620
<3-17,PHOEBE>他也不住在没有电话的缅甸茅屋里头
<3-17,PHOEBE>And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

133
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,790
<3-18,GRANDMOTHER>我听说他在纽约州某个地方当药剂师
<3-18,GRANDMOTHER>Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,750
<3-19,PHOEBE>那没有道理
<3-19,PHOEBE>That makes no sense.

135
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,140
<3-19,PHOEBE>村民们为什么要崇拜一个药剂师呢
<3-19,PHOEBE>Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

136
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,010
<3-20,GRANDMOTHER>亲爱的
<3-20,GRANDMOTHER>Honey.

137
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,080
<3-21,PHOEBE>反正我所知道的就这么多
<3-21,PHOEBE>Anyway, that's all I know.

138
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,070
<3-21,PHOEBE>还有
<3-21,PHOEBE>That...

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,420
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>这个
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>...and this.

140
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,110
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>这
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>This...

141
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>是他本人
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>...is the real him.

142
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,410
<4-1,CHANDLER>我记得我爸爸  他穿了一身火红的衣服
<4-1,CHANDLER>I remember my father all dressed up in the red suit...

143
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,950
<4-1,CHANDLER>黑色的大靴子  还有漆皮皮带
<4-1,CHANDLER>...the big black boots and the patent leather belt...

144
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,990
<4-1,CHANDLER>在楼下鬼鬼崇崇的  他不想被任何人发现
<4-1,CHANDLER>...sneaking around downstairs. He didn't want us to see him...

145
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,470
<4-1,CHANDLER>可是他醉得东倒西歪
<4-1,CHANDLER>but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble,

146
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,790
<4-1,CHANDLER>然后撞东撞西  把大家都吵醒
<4-1,CHANDLER>crash into something and wake everybody up.

147
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,480
<4-2,RACHEL>听起来不像是个快乐的圣诞节
<4-2,RACHEL>That doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

148
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,530
<4-3,CHANDLER>谁说起圣诞节了
<4-3,CHANDLER>Who said anything about Christmas?

149
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,230
<4-5,ROSS>有没有菲比的消息
<4-5,ROSS>Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

150
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,340
<4-6,RACHEL>没有
<4-6,RACHEL>No, nothing.

151
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,960
<4-7,MONICA>希望她没事
<4-7,MONICA>I hope she's okay.

<4-8,JOEY>是啊  我清楚知道她的处境
<4-8,JOEY>Yeah. I know exactly what she's going through.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,020
<4-9,MONICA>你怎么会清楚知道她的处境
<4-9,MONICA>How do you know exactly what she's going through?

154
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,770
<4-10,JOEY>她告诉我们的
<4-10,JOEY>She told us.

155
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,340
<4-11,CHANDLER>摩妮卡  你买了什么
<4-11,CHANDLER>What do you got there, Monica?

156

<4-12,MONICA>派对要用的东西
<4-12,MONICA>Just some stuff for the party.

157

<4-13,ROSS>你们还在这里干什么  你们不是该去买礼物了吗
<4-13,ROSS>What are you guys doing here?Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

158
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,300
<4-14,MONICA>你们礼物还没买好吗
<4-14,MONICA>You didn't buy presents yet?

159
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,580
<4-14,MONICA>明天就是平安夜了  你们要怎么办
<4-14,MONICA>Tomorrow's Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

160
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,840
<4-15,CHANDLER>不是黏土动画里面的人才会那么说的吗
<4-15,CHANDLER>Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

161
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,220
<4-16,RACHEL>对了  摩妮卡  我想邮差不喜欢你的饼干
<4-16,RACHEL>Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies.

162
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,070
<4-16,RACHEL>这是你妈寄来的装饰品
<4-16,RACHEL>Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

163
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,780
<4-17,MONICA>说不定他喜欢我的饼干  只是嫌少了
<4-17,MONICA>Maybe the mailman liked the cookies. We just didn't give him enough.

164
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,110
<4-18,JOEY>摩妮卡  鸽子的觉悟都比你高
<4-18,JOEY>Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

171
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,190
<4-22,RACHEL>没有胆量
<4-22,RACHEL>...you're gutless.

172
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,660
<4-22,RACHEL>你从来不知道怎么"把握时机"
<4-22,RACHEL>You don't ever just "seize the day."

173
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,660
<4-22,RACHEL>你暗恋我一年了吧  结果你一直憋在心里
<4-22,RACHEL>You liked me for a year and you didn't do anything about it.

174
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,420
<4-22,RACHEL>还有  你头发涂了太多发胶了
<4-22,RACHEL>And you wear too much of that gel in your hair.

<5-4,GRANDMOTHER>-查得怎么样了  -不太好
<5-4,GRANDMOTHER>- How's it going? - Not so good.

<5-5,PHOEBE>纽约州那么大  他那么渺小  你自己算算
<5-5,PHOEBE>Upstate's pretty big. He's pretty small. You do the math.

<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>我觉得你还是别找了

190
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,770
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>但是对我而言  他是个不负责任的混球
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>But to me, he's still the irresponsible creep...

191
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,540
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>让你妈怀孕  又偷她的车子
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>...who locked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.

<5-7,PHOEBE>是啊  我知道

<5-8,GRANDMOTHER>其实是骗你的
<5-8,GRANDMOTHER>uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.

285
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,590
<9-9,MR. TREEGER>说不定是因为我表皮太多了
<9-9,MR. TREEGER>Probably because I have so much skin.

286
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,140
<9-9,MR. TREEGER>奶酪

292
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,690
<9-13,ROSS>他虽然是你们的管理员  我也要把握一下
<9-13,ROSS>Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

<9-20,ROSS>你要说"强硬"吧

<9-27,RACHEL>发胶兄
<9-27,RACHEL>...gel boy.

317
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,760
<9-28,MR. TREEGER>这是檞寄生吧
<9-28,MR. TREEGER>Is this mistletoe?

319
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,830
<9-29,RACHEL>叫甜罗勒
<9-29,RACHEL>That is basil.

320
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,100
<9-30,MR. TREEGER>如果是檞寄生  我就要亲你了
<9-30,MR. TREEGER>If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

321
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,200
<9-31,RACHEL>不  那还是甜罗勒
<9-31,RACHEL>No, it's still basil.

322
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,370
<10-2,JOEY>*火炉上烤栗子*
<10-2,JOEY>*Chestnuts roasting on an open fire*

323
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,110
<10-3,PHOEBE>*雪人在啃你的鼻子*
<10-3,PHOEBE>*Jack Frost nipping at your nose*

324
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,000
<10-4,CHANDLER>-你走到哪里了  -信箱
<10-4,CHANDLER>- How far did you get? - Mailbox.

325
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,100
<10-5,PHOEBE>有进步了
<10-5,PHOEBE>All right, we're getting closer.

326
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,690
<10-6,JOEY>菲比  你怎么了
<10-6,JOEY>Phoebs, what's goin' on?

327
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,680
<10-7,PHOEBE>其实原因很多
<10-7,PHOEBE>It's just like a whole mess of stuff.

328
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,330
<10-7,PHOEBE>昨天  我爸还是一个名闻遐迩的缅甸树医
<10-7,PHOEBE>Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

329
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,160
<10-7,PHOEBE>可他转眼成了药剂师
<10-7,PHOEBE>And you know, now he's a pharmacist guy and....

330
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,180
<10-8,JOEY>也可能他是一个很不错的药剂师
<10-8,JOEY>Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.

331
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,820
<10-9,PHOEBE>对  有可能  对  然后我会跑去敲他家的门
<10-9,PHOEBE>Yeah, maybe! And I'll knock on the door...

332
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,450
<10-9,PHOEBE>他会拥抱我  我会有个爸爸
<10-9,PHOEBE>...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad!

333
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,110
<10-9,PHOEBE>然后大家都会对我很友善
<10-9,PHOEBE>I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me...

334
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,290
<10-9,PHOEBE>因为我是弗兰克的女儿
<10-9,PHOEBE>... because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.

335
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,720
<10-10,CHANDLER>那怎么不去敲门
<10-10,CHANDLER>So why not go knock?

336
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,470
<10-11,PHOEBE>因为如果他不够做父亲的资格呢
<10-11,PHOEBE>Because, I mean, what if he's not this great-dad guy?

337
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,330
<10-11,PHOEBE>如果他还是那个抛妻弃女的浑球呢
<10-11,PHOEBE>What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?

338
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,500
<10-11,PHOEBE>你知道吗
<10-11,PHOEBE>You know what?

339
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,900
<10-11,PHOEBE>我这个礼拜已经失去一个假爸爸了
<10-11,PHOEBE>I've already lost a fake dad this week.

340
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,920
<10-11,PHOEBE>我不想再失去一个真的爸爸
<10-11,PHOEBE>I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

341
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,440
<10-12,JOEY>菲菲  没关系的  你已经跨出一大步了
<10-12,JOEY>Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.

342
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,300
<10-14,CHANDLER>哪天你准备好了  就会主动去认他了
<10-14,CHANDLER>Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

343
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,330
<10-15,JOEY>到那个时候  他认你这个女儿  会感到很幸运
<10-15,JOEY>And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

344
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,290
<10-16,PHOEBE>你们真好
<10-16,PHOEBE>You guys....

345
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,290
<10-16,PHOEBE>抱歉害你们来不及购物了
<10-16,PHOEBE>I'm sorry about your shopping.

346
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,990
<10-17,CHANDLER>没关系  会有办法的
<10-17,CHANDLER>Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

347
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,580
<10-18,JOEY>我知道你不要进去
<10-18,JOEY>Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there

348
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,250
<10-18,JOEY>但我可不可以进去借用洗手间
<10-18,JOEY>but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom?

349
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,630
<10-18,JOEY>没关系  算了
<10-18,JOEY>That's fine, never mind.

350
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,780
<10-18,JOEY>不错  下雪了
<10-18,JOEY>Cool, snow!

351
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,900
<10-18,JOEY>像空白的画布
<10-18,JOEY>Kind of like a blank canvas.

352
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,530
<11-1,CHANDLER>我的老天  这里好热
<11-1,CHANDLER>Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!

353
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,180
<11-2,JOEY>介意我把暖气关小吗
<11-2,JOEY>Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?

354
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,610
<11-3,MONICA>我们怎么都没想到呢
