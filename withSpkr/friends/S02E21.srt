<5-26,BIG BULLY>即将要痛扁你们的人会这么说
<5-26,BIG BULLY>The guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.

177
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,170
<5-27,CHANDLER>谁叫你多嘴呢
<5-27,CHANDLER>You had to ask.

<5-29,ROSS>...the thing is, we're not gonna fight you guys.

180
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,920
<5-30,LITTLE BULLY>那么这样好了
<5-30,LITTLE BULLY>Here's the deal.

181
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,420
<5-30,LITTLE BULLY>不出去也行  只要你们保证
<5-30,LITTLE BULLY>You won't have to, so long as you never

182
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,000
<5-30,LITTLE BULLY>从今以后不踏入这家咖啡馆
<5-30,LITTLE BULLY>ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.

183
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,230
<5-31,CHANDLER>你太早把甘瑟抬出来了
<5-31,CHANDLER>I think you played the Gunther card too soon.

184
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,860
<6-1,JOEY>菲比  我想你可以过去了
<6-1,JOEY>Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

<6-2,PHOEBE>我不知道
<6-2,PHOEBE>Yeah, I don't know.

186
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,890
<6-3,RACHEL>又怎么了
<6-3,RACHEL>What's the matter?

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,940
<6-4,PHOEBE>我只是觉得这是个很不好的预兆
<6-4,PHOEBE>I just think that this was a really bad sign.

188
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,200
<6-4,PHOEBE>像是门槛上的野兽啦
<6-4,PHOEBE>Like the beast at the threshold.

189
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,970
<6-4,PHOEBE>我已经没有别的亲人了
<6-4,PHOEBE>It's just I have like no family left, ya know.

190
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,510
<6-4,PHOEBE>除了我外婆之外
<6-4,PHOEBE>except for my grandmother.

191
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,430
<6-4,PHOEBE>可是面对现实吧  她又不会永远都活着
<6-4,PHOEBE>But let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever.

192
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,660
<6-4,PHOEBE>虽然她说她会
<6-4,PHOEBE>Despite what she says.

193
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,170
<6-4,PHOEBE>我有个姐姐
<6-4,PHOEBE>And I have a sister who

194
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,770
<6-4,PHOEBE>但共住一个子宫后  几乎就没说过话了
<6-4,PHOEBE>I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.

195
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,750
<6-2,PHOEBE>这是我的亲生父亲
<6-2,PHOEBE>I don't know. This is my real father...

196
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,330
<6-4,PHOEBE>我只是希望能一切完美
<6-4,PHOEBE>and I just, I want things to be like just right.

197
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,080
<6-5,RACHEL>菲比  我完全了解
<6-5,RACHEL>Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.

<6-7,PHOEBE>谢了  对不起
<6-7,PHOEBE>Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

201
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,410
<6-8,PHOEBE>那是什么
<6-8,PHOEBE>What was that?

202
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,670
<6-9,JOEY>我猜现在门槛安全了
<6-9,JOEY>I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

203
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,780
<7-1,MONICA>我要买五股SGJ  我现在就要
<7-1,MONICA>I want to buy five shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now.

<7-2,RACHEL>"Time is money, my friend?"

207
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,290
<7-3,JOEY>你错过了  "钱生钱"
<7-3,JOEY>You missed "Takes money to make money"

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,460
<7-3,JOEY>还有  "别逼我过去踢你的华尔街屁股"
<7-3,JOEY>and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt."

209
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,100
<7-4,MONICA>我早餐前就赚了十七块  你做了什么
<7-4,MONICA>I made $ 17 before breakfast. What have you done?

210
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,610
<7-5,JOEY>我在这里吃早餐
<7-5,JOEY>I had breakfast here,

211
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,370
<7-5,JOEY>所以技术上讲我省了三块半
<7-5,JOEY>so technically I saved $3.50.

212
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,900
<7-6,RACHEL>你怎么赚十七块的
<7-6,RACHEL>How did you make $17?

213
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,400
<7-7,MONICA>我的金融白痴朋友
<7-7,MONICA>Well, my financially challenged friends

214
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,930
<7-7,MONICA>我分别买了些CHP跟ZXY的股票
<7-7,MONICA>I split my money and bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.

215
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,100
<7-8,JOEY>你怎么选的
<7-8,JOEY>How come those?

216
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,900
<7-9,MONICA>CHP是因为我暗恋过埃里克·埃斯特拉达
<7-9,MONICA>Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.

218
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,450
<7-9,MONICA>ZXY  因为听起来很"劲"感
<7-9,MONICA>And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy."

219
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,840
<7-10,RACHEL>那你的MEG呢
<7-10,RACHEL>What happened to MEG?

<7-11,MONICA>MEG帮我赚过钱  但是被我甩了
<7-11,MONICA>MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

221
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,880
<7-11,MONICA>我的座右铭是  "在疲软以前撤退"
<7-11,MONICA>My motto is, "Get out before they go down."

222
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,130
<7-12,JOEY>这绝对不是我的座右铭
<7-12,JOEY>That is so not my motto.

223
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,490
<7-14,RACHEL>菲比  狗怎么样了
<7-14,RACHEL>Pheebs, how's the dog?

224
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,950
<7-15,PHOEBE>我跟兽医谈过了  纽约州北部的人真好
<7-15,PHOEBE>Okay. I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.

225
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,670
<7-15,PHOEBE>他说小家伙不会有问题
<7-15,PHOEBE>Anyway he said the little fella's gonna be okay,

226

<7-15,PHOEBE>明天我就可以去接它了

<7-17,RACHEL>-好极了  -谢天谢地
<7-17,RACHEL>- Good. - Thank God.

228
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,600
<7-18,PHOEBE>可是他不得不给它缝了好多针
<7-18,PHOEBE>But he did have to have a bunch of stitches.

229
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,820
<7-18,PHOEBE>他还说除非天下红雨
<7-18,PHOEBE>And he said that only once in a blue moon

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,830
<7-18,PHOEBE>狗的耳朵才会再长出来
<7-18,PHOEBE>does a dog's ear grow back.

231
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,570

234
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,420
<7-20,PHOEBE>我不想在电话里跟我爸相认
<7-20,PHOEBE>I don't want to meet my father over the phone.

235
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,220
<7-20,PHOEBE>我该怎么说  难不成说"我是菲比
<7-20,PHOEBE>What am I gonna say, like "Hi, I'm Phoebe,

236
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,010
<7-20,PHOEBE>被你抛弃的女儿

256
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,960
<8-4,ROSS>对极了
<8-4,ROSS>Absolutely.

257
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,990
<8-5,ROSS>咖啡粉为什么不化
<8-5,ROSS>How come it's not mixing with the water?

258
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,660
<8-5,ROSS>包装上说必须要不停地搅拌
<8-5,ROSS>Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving.

259
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,260
<8-5,ROSS>一边搅拌一边喝  别让咖啡停下来
<8-5,ROSS>Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.

260
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,660
<8-6,JOEY>这太荒唐了吧
<8-6,JOEY>This is ridiculous.

261
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,580
<8-6,JOEY>这样吧
<8-6,JOEY>I'll tell you what.

272
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,590
<8-10,ROSS>喝这种"布卡奇诺"
<8-10,ROSS>drinking cappucino with a "K".

273
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,000
<8-10,ROSS>我们应该回咖啡馆去  勇敢面对那些人
<8-10,ROSS>I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,040

278
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,450
<8-15,ROSS>那又怎样  就算被扁又怎么样
<8-15,ROSS>So what? So what if we get beaten up,

279
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,520
<8-15,ROSS>也许每个男人
<8-15,ROSS>maybe that's just something every man

280
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,080
<8-15,ROSS>都得经历一次
<8-15,ROSS>has to go through once in his life.

281
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,010
<8-15,ROSS>就好像取得通过权什么的
<8-15,ROSS>Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin’.

282
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,030
<8-16,CHANDLER>再失去一次童贞不行吗

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,660
<10-25,FRANK>他脸上满是笑意  还冲我挥手
<10-25,FRANK>He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving

342
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,500
<10-25,FRANK>因为他踩高跷的时候
<10-25,FRANK>'cause he was always happiest

343
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,770
<10-25,FRANK>就是他最高兴的时候
<10-25,FRANK>when he was on his stilts.
