<1-8,Ross>天花板上有人叫门了
<1-8,Ross>Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

<1-9,Rachel>我们楼上的芳邻吵得要命

<1-10,Monica>他把地毯拆掉了  现在什么都能听到
<1-10,Monica>He took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,260
<1-11,Phoebe>你干嘛不上去要求他"轻声慢步"呢
<1-11,Phoebe>Why don't you go up there ask him to just, "Step lightly, please?"

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,080
<1-12,Monica>我试过五次了  但那家伙魅力无穷
<1-12,Monica>I have, like five times. But the guy is so charming...

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,340
<1-12,Monica>我上去大呼小叫  可最后还要跟他赔不是
<1-12,Monica>I go up there to yell, then I end up apologizing to him.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,370
<1-13,Phoebe>太荒谬了
<1-13,Phoebe>That is silly!

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,540
<1-13,Phoebe>我上去叫他小声点
<1-13,Phoebe>I'll go up there and I'll tell him to keep it down.

<1-16,Joey>When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was...

00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,820
<1-16,Joey>我很快地看了一眼  肉眼是看不到的
<1-16,Joey>I looked at it so fast, it was invisible to the naked eye.

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,910
<1-16,Joey>我刚看了

80
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,530

<4-3,Rachel>Then I think:

81
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,620
<4-3,Rachel>为什么有人会做这种有损尊严的工作
<4-3,Rachel>"Why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job

82
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,210
<4-3,Rachel>难道就因为这份工作和兴趣有一点点关系吗
<4-3,Rachel>just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?

<6-17,Rachel>对  他叫"马克"什么的
<6-17,Rachel>Yeah. His name is "Mark" something.

133
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,050
<6-18,Ross>看来"马克什么"的不怀好意
<6-18,Ross>Sounds like "Mark Something" wants to have some sex!

<6-19,Rachel>什么

<6-20,Ross>不然他干嘛
<6-20,Ross>I'm just saying, I mean, why else would he

136
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,870
<6-20,Ross>莫名其妙地冒出来
<6-20,Ross>swoop in and out of nowhere for no reason?

137
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,180
<6-21,Rachel>日行一善啊
<6-21,Rachel>To be nice?

138
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,040
<6-22,Ross>乔伊  男人会不会没企图地对陌生女子行善
<6-22,Ross>Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?

139
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,630
<6-23,Joey>-不会  男人只想上床  -谢谢
<6-23,Joey>- No, only for sex. - Thank you.

140
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,680
<6-24,Ross>你有没有跟马克什么的提起我
<6-24,Ross>So did you tell "Mark Something" about me?

141
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,440
<6-25,Rachel>我用不着提  因为我挂着
<6-25,Rachel>I didn't have to. Because I was wearing...

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,080
<6-25,Rachel>"我爱罗斯"的广告牌  而且一直摇铃铛
<6-25,Rachel>my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board and ringing my bell.

<6-33,Phoebe>我喝的是伏特加和小红莓汁
<6-33,Phoebe>Well, I have a vodka and cranberry juice.

149
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,430
<6-33,Phoebe>真的

150
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,900
<6-34,Cookie>我干掉我丈夫之后
<6-34,Cookie>That's the exact same drink I made myself

151
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,150
<6-34,Cookie>就是调这种酒来喝
<6-34,Cookie>right after I shot my husband.

152
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,050
<6-35,Phoebe>好吧  我不知道该怎么跟你说话
<6-35,Phoebe>Well, I don't know how to talk to you.

153
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,880
<6-35,Phoebe>你在干嘛
<6-35,Phoebe>What are you doing?

154
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,960
<7-1,Chandler>把我前任女友的快速拨号删除
<7-1,Chandler>Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.

155
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,510
<7-2,Chandler>不  这是好事
<7-2,Chandler>No, it's a good thing.

156
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,160
<7-2,Chandler>我们要快速拨号干嘛  干嘛赶来赶去的
<7-2,Chandler>Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life?

157
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,230
<7-2,Chandler>我们为什么不慢慢享受美好时光
<7-2,Chandler>Why can't we savor the precious moments?

158
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,590
<7-2,Chandler>你胸部好大
<7-2,Chandler>Those are some huge breasts you have!

159
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,640
<8-3,Ross>我听说瑞秋今天遇到个叫马克的家伙
<8-3,Ross>So I heard about this Mark guy that Rachel met today.

160
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,340
<8-4,Monica>-很棒吧  -是啊
<8-4,Monica>- Isn't it great? - Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,320
<8-5,Ross>对  是很棒  听起来他是个好人
<8-5,Ross>Yeah, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.

162
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,380
<8-5,Ross>对  他可迷人了
<8-5,Ross>Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy!

163
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,320
<8-6,Monica>他走的时候  我引用了经典的胡言乱语
<8-6,Monica>I mean, when he left, I actually used the phrase:

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,330
<8-6,Monica>哈米娜  哈米娜  哈米娜
<8-6,Monica>"Hummina, hummina, hummina."

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,630
<8-7,Ross>太好了
<8-7,Ross>That's excellent.

166
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,840
<9-1,Ross>这么说他只是个大好人罢了
<9-1,Ross>So he's "just a nice guy."

167
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,790
<9-1,Ross>你真的认为这个叫马克的
<9-1,Ross>Do you really think this Mark

168
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,290
<9-1,Ross>是不求回报地帮你吗
<9-1,Ross>doesn't want anything in exchange for helping you?

169
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,390
<9-2,Rachel>我想我得跟他洗鸳鸯浴
<9-2,Rachel>Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.

170
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,480
<9-2,Rachel>不过哪份工作不是这样
<9-2,Rachel>But you know that's true of any job.

171
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,510
<9-3,Monica>你感觉怎么样
<9-3,Monica>How you feeling?

172
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,540
<9-4,Chandler>我的公寓已经不存在了
<9-4,Chandler>Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...

173
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,480
<9-4,Chandler>因为全被我喝掉了
<9-4,Chandler>because I drank it.

174
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,460
<9-5,Phoebe>你去哪里了  你拆开所有礼物之后就不见了
<9-5,Phoebe>Where'd you get to? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.

175
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,550
<9-7,Chandler>我后来跑到贮藏室  而且不止我一个人
<9-7,Chandler>I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.

176
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,530
<9-8,All>不要再叫了
<9-8,All>No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

177
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,830
<9-10,Phoebe>怎么了  发生了什么事
<9-10,Phoebe>Why, what happened?

178
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,760
<9-11,Chandler>我上了乔伊的姐妹
<9-11,Chandler>I fooled around with Joey's sister.

179
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,610
<9-11,Chandler>这还不是最糟糕的
<9-11,Chandler>That's not the worst part.

180
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,330
<9-12,Monica>那最糟糕的是什么
<9-12,Monica>What is the worst part?

181
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,530
<9-13,Chandler>我不记得是哪个姐妹
<9-13,Chandler>I can't remember which sister.

182
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,090
<9-14,Ross>你看到没有  别说男人有好人
<9-14,Ross>You see what men do? Don't tell me men are nice.

183
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,650
<9-14,Ross>这就是男人
<9-14,Ross>This is men!

184
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,440
<10-1,Monica>你疯了不成
<10-1,Monica>Are you insane?

185
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,680
<10-1,Monica>乔伊会杀了你  他真的会把你杀得死死的
<10-1,Monica>I mean, Joey's gonna kill you. He's actually going to kill you dead.

186
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,970
<10-2,Chandler>你以为我没想到吗
<10-2,Chandler>Okay, You don't think I thought of that?

187
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,390
<10-3,Phoebe>你怎么会不知道是哪一个
<10-3,Phoebe>How can you not know which one?

188
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,880
<10-4,Rachel>简直无法置信

<10-9,Chandler>看到没  你们也分不清谁是谁
<10-9,Chandler>You see? You can't tell which is which either!

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,530
<10-10,Phoebe>我们可没有跟她们胡搞
<10-10,Phoebe>We didn't fool around with any of them.

194
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,300
<10-11,Chandler>一定是维罗妮卡  那个穿红裙子的女孩
<10-11,Chandler>Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica. The girl in the red skirt.

195
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,160

211
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,740

<10-28,Joey>Now is that true?

214
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,570
<10-28,Joey>还是你泡我妹妹只是为了忘记珍妮斯
<10-28,Joey>Or are you just getting over Janice by groping my sister?

215

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,140
<14-5,Monica>你得主动出击

<14-27,Monica>Even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her...

307
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,110
<14-27,Monica>这表示他就能得逞吗

<16-2,Chandler>我刚结束一段感情

<16-4,Chandler>这真是太糟糕了
<16-4,Chandler>This is so bad.

<16-4,Chandler>如果你不是玛丽·安琪拉  那谁是
<16-4,Chandler>If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?

<16-8,Chandler>没什么大不了的  钱德勒刚才亲我
<16-8,Chandler>It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissing me...

350
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,100
<16-9,Joey>因为他以为我是玛丽·安琪拉
<16-9,Joey>because he thought I was Mary Angela.

351
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,890
<16-9,Joey>什么  你怎么会把她当成玛丽·安琪拉
<16-9,Joey>What? How could you do that? How could you think she was Mary Angela?

352
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,880
<16-10,Chandler>我不确定哪一个是玛丽·安琪拉
<16-10,Chandler>I wasn't sure which one Mary Angela was.

353
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,230
<16-10,Chandler>对不起  我喝得醉醺醺
<16-10,Chandler>Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I was really drunk...

<16-12,Chandler>因为你们的兄弟是不会揍我的
<16-12,Chandler>because, you know, your brother's not gonna punch me.

00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,900
<16-13,Joey>但我万万没想到有一天会揍你
<16-13,Joey>But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it.

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,160
<16-13,Joey>你怎么能做这种事
<16-13,Joey>How could you do this?

373
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,170
