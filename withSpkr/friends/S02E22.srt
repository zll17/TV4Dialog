2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,230
<1-1,MONICA>既然是瑞秋的生日
<1-1,MONICA>and since it's Rachel's birthday,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,020
<1-1,MONICA>就要特别点  我想我来煮一条鲑鱼

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,600
<1-3,MONICA>怎么了
<1-3,MONICA>What?

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,990
<1-4,ROSS>我要问为什么每次开派对  你都要水煮东西
<1-4,ROSS>Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,550
<1-5,MONICA>你想掌管食物委员会吗
<1-5,MONICA>You wanna be in charge of the food committee?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,370
<1-6,ROSS>问题二  为什么每次派对都要有食物委员会
<1-6,ROSS>Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,520
<1-7,JOEY>是啊  为什么不买些披萨跟啤酒
<1-7,JOEY>Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,400
<1-7,JOEY>大家高兴就好了嘛
<1-7,JOEY>and have fun?

<1-8,ROSS>我同意  我认为高档派对  只有那些
<1-8,ROSS>Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,500
<1-9,PHOEBE>真心高档次的人才玩得开心
<1-9,PHOEBE>if you're fancy on the inside

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,470
<1-9,PHOEBE>我们又不是这种人
<1-9,PHOEBE>and I'm just not sure we are.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,510
<1-10,MONICA>好吧  你们不想要特别的  随便
<1-10,MONICA>Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine.

14
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,560
<1-10,MONICA>你们爱怎么样就怎么样
<1-10,MONICA>You can throw any kind of party you want.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,960
<1-11,MONICA>乔伊  那是假的
<1-11,MONICA>Joey they're not real.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,740
<1-11,MONICA>我这里面空空如也  这是假的
<1-11,MONICA>I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake.

17
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,030
<1-11,MONICA>看  空空如也
<1-11,MONICA>See, honk honk.

<1-12,CHANDLER>哇  像是给小丑看的黄片
<1-12,CHANDLER>Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.

34
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,130
<2-1,ROSS>我跟瑞秋的妹妹讲了  她们都不能来
<2-1,ROSS>I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.

35
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,820
<2-2,MONICA>那我还得邀请迪伦  艾玛
<2-2,MONICA>Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,130
<2-2,MONICA>还有夏伦·库珀
<2-2,MONICA>and Shannon Cooper.

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,990
<2-4,PHOEBE>为什么呢
<2-4,PHOEBE>Why not her?

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,650
<2-5,JOEY>因为她  偷东西
<2-5,JOEY>Cause she uh, she steals stuff.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,340
<2-6,CHANDLER>又或许她不会偷东西
<2-6,CHANDLER>Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,050
<2-6,CHANDLER>乔伊跟她上床后  就没再打电话给她了
<2-6,CHANDLER>and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.

42
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,610
<2-7,MONICA>乔伊  你太过分了
<2-7,MONICA>Joey that is horriable.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,390
<2-8,JOEY>或许太喜欢了  我不知道
<2-8,JOEY>Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,310
<2-8,JOEY>我想我只是害怕了
<2-8,JOEY>I guess I just got scared.

46
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,520
<2-9,PHOEBE>抱歉  我不知道
<2-9,PHOEBE>I'm sorry, I didn't know.

47
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,140
<2-10,JOEY>没想到有人会吃这一套
<2-10,JOEY>I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,100
<2-11,ROSS>亲爱的  怎么样
<2-11,ROSS>Hi honey, how did it go?

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,170
<2-12,RACHEL>如同地狱的毕业典礼一般
<2-12,RACHEL>Agh, it was the graduation from hell.

50

<2-13,CHANDLER>我表弟靠着足球奖学金进了地狱
<2-13,CHANDLER>Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

51
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,810
<2-14,RACHEL>这本来应该是个快乐的场合
<2-14,RACHEL>Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion.

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,230
<2-14,RACHEL>我妹妹从大学毕业了  谁也没想到
<2-14,RACHEL>My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,260
<2-14,RACHEL>真正证明了
<2-14,RACHEL>It's a true testament to

54
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,040
<2-14,RACHEL>一个长岛女孩为了一辆跑车会做什么
<2-14,RACHEL>what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,570
<2-15,MONICA>到底怎么了

<2-16,RACHEL>他们只需要坐在同一个体育馆
<2-16,RACHEL>All they had to do was sit in the same stadium,

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,730
<2-16,RACHEL>骄傲地微笑  绝口不提离婚的事
<2-16,RACHEL>smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce.

59
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,690
<2-16,RACHEL>但不  毕业典礼致词到一半时
<2-16,RACHEL>But nooo, they got into a huge fight

60
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,290
<2-16,RACHEL>他们就吵得不可开交了
<2-16,RACHEL>in the middle of the commencement address.

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,450
<2-16,RACHEL>图图主教还得停下来  叫他们两个住口

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,490
<6-64,ROSS>你一去的话  就不会觉得派对梦幻了
<6-64,ROSS>If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.

241
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,590
<6-64,ROSS>你还是带着你的威士忌回去
<6-64,ROSS>Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there

<7-5,RACHEL>当我们帮忙时  他又会大吼说我们越帮越忙
<7-5,RACHEL>and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

349
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,110
<7-5,RACHEL>但是当烟火开始后  大家都闭嘴了
<7-5,RACHEL>But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up,

350
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,700
<7-5,RACHEL>然后会变得很冷
<7-5,RACHEL>you know, and it'd get really cold,

351
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,050
<7-5,RACHEL>我们会全部挤在一条毯子下面
<7-5,RACHEL>and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket.

352
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
<7-5,RACHEL>从来没有人想到要多带一条来
