1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,650
<1-1,Rachel>什么鬼动静
<1-1,Rachel>What the hell is that?!

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,530
<1-1,Rachel>什么鬼动静  是你叫的吗
<1-1,Rachel>What the hell is that? Is that you?

3
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,700
<1-2,Monica>-你清晨的火气还真大  -滚远一点
<1-2,Monica>-You're really not a morning person. -Just back off!

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,210
<1-3,Rachel>起床  起来  快起
<1-3,Rachel>Get up! Get up! Get up!

5
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,710
<1-4,Rachel>什么声音这么吵
<1-4,Rachel>What is that noise?

6
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,320
<1-5,Chandler>你的敲门声
<1-5,Chandler>You!

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,810
<1-6,Joey>是阿鸡啊
<1-6,Joey>It's the chick.

8
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,250
<1-6,Joey>她正经历着过渡时期
<1-6,Joey>She's going through some changes.

9
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,830
<1-7,Monica>什么过渡时期
<1-7,Monica>What kind of changes?

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,090
<1-8,Chandler>兽医好像认为...
<1-8,Chandler>The vet seems to think...

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,600
<1-8,Chandler>咱们的小母鸡要长大成公鸡了
<1-8,Chandler>that she's becoming a rooster.

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,330
<1-8,Chandler>我们打算再问问别的兽医
<1-8,Chandler>We're getting a second opinion.

28
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,520
<2-2,Ross>你干嘛清晨八点去血拼
<2-2,Ross>Why are you shopping at 8 in the morning?

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,860
<2-3,Rachel>我六点钟就起床了
<2-3,Rachel>I've been up since 6...

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,490
<2-3,Rachel>都是被某人的笨公鸡害的
<2-3,Rachel>thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.

31
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,300
<2-4,Phoebe>你们俩真的应该把它们放生
<2-4,Phoebe>You guys, you really should get rid of those animals.

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,290
<2-4,Phoebe>它们本不该被圈在公寓里
<2-4,Phoebe>They shouldn't be living in an apartment.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,900
<2-5,Rachel>而且家里的刀和食谱那么多  太不安全了
<2-5,Rachel>Especially not with these knives and cookbooks around.

34
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,940
<2-6,Phoebe>我要去医院的不孕不育科做个检查
<2-6,Phoebe>All right, I'm going to the fertility doctor

35
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,050
<2-6,Phoebe>看看我的身体状况是否适合将弗兰克和爱丽丝的
<2-6,Phoebe>and see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo

36
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,440
<2-6,Phoebe>胚胎移植到我的子宫里去
<2-6,Phoebe>transferred into my uterus.

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,440
<2-7,Ross>医生怎么判断你的身体状况适不适合
<2-7,Ross>How will they know if you are ready?

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,980
<2-8,Phoebe>他们要看看我的子宫内膜是不是已经足够厚了
<2-8,Phoebe>They'll just gonna look and see if my endometrial layer is thick.

39
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,740
<2-9,Chandler>这个检查我可以代劳啊
<2-9,Chandler>I can check that for you.

40
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,950
<2-10,Phoebe>各位  帮我的子宫内膜加油吧
<2-10,Phoebe>Okay, think ''thick.''

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,950
<2-11,All>祝你好运
<2-11,All>Good luck!

42
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,130
<2-12,Phoebe>快祝我幸运

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,720
<2-11,All>祝你好运
<2-11,All>Good luck.

44
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,470
<2-15,Monica>-我说得准没错  -鬼才信你
<2-15,Monica>- I'm still right. - That is so not true.

45
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,850
<2-16,Rachel>怎么了
<2-16,Rachel>What?

46
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,220
<2-17,Joey>她不爽是因为我知道  她今天要洗衣服
<2-17,Joey>She's mad because I know today is her laundry day...

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,080
<2-17,Joey>所以现在穿的肯定是大妈才穿的那种内裤
<2-17,Joey>and that means she's wearing her old-lady underpants.

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,450
<2-18,Chandler>要不要我帮你检查一下
<2-18,Chandler>I can check that for you.

49
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,060
<2-19,Monica>太不知天高地厚了  你们怎么会觉得
<2-19,Monica>I just can't believe that you think you and Chandler

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,250
<2-19,Monica>你和钱德勒对我和瑞秋的了解
<2-19,Monica>know me and Rachel

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,990
<2-19,Monica>甚于我们对你俩的了解
<2-19,Monica>better than we know you.

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,990
<2-20,Chandler>事实如此嘛
<2-20,Chandler>Well, we do.

53
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,470
<2-20,Chandler>你吃薄荷糖时一定要吃偶数个
<2-20,Chandler>You can only eat Tic Tacs in even numbers.

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,640
<2-21,Joey>这是什么毛病啊
<2-21,Joey>What's that about?

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,330
<2-22,Chandler>而你嘛  罗斯  你去搜搜瑞秋的购物袋
<2-22,Chandler>And you! Ross, I believe if you check Rachel's bag,

56
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,410
<2-22,Chandler>里面肯定有一盒吃了一半的饼干
<2-22,Chandler>you'll find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,180
<2-22,Chandler>你真是神了
<2-22,Chandler>You're good.

<2-51,Chandler>我们昨晚玩扮鬼脸时把她们的胶带用光了
<2-51,Chandler>We used up theirs last night making scary faces.

<2-53,Chandler>Give me it!

87
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,580
<2-54,Monica>这也说明不了你们俩更了解我们俩啊
<2-54,Monica>It does not mean you know us better.

88
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,090
<2-55,Rachel>我要求再比一次  猜杂货太没挑战性了
<2-55,Rachel>I want a rematch. And no stupid grocery questions. Real, personal questions.

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,850
<2-56,Monica>赌一百块
<2-56,Monica>And the winner gets $ 1 00.

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,930
<2-59,Joey>谁出考题呢

94
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,300
<2-60,Monica>是啊  让罗斯来
<2-60,Monica>Sure, Ross will do it.

95
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,600
<2-61,Ross>他难道没工作  没孩子  没有自己的生活吗
<2-61,Ross>Sounds like he hasn't a job or a child or a life of his own.

96
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,760
<2-62,Rachel>没关系  那找菲比好了
<2-62,Rachel>Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.

97
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,150
<2-62,Rachel>不要  人家想玩嘛
<2-62,Rachel>No, l want to play.

98
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,590
<3-1,Dr. Zane>你的子宫可以做胚胎移植了
<3-1,Dr. Zane>Looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.

99
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,320
<3-2,Phoebe>怪不得我今天一早就觉得自己笨手笨脚
<3-2,Phoebe>l knew it! I felt really thick this morning.

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,760
<3-3,Frank>下面该做什么了  快去取受精卵  植入进去
<3-3,Frank>Okay, so what's now? Go get the eggs. Put them in there.

101
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,330
<3-4,Dr. Zane>好的  我去准备那些胚胎  稍等片刻
<3-4,Dr. Zane>Okay, it'll take a little while to prepare the embryos.

102
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,540
<3-5,Phoebe>-那些胚胎  -不只一个吗  其实一共有五个
<3-5,Phoebe>-Embryos? As in more than one? -Five, actually.

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,870
<3-6,Dr. Zane>五个呢  那我要在哪儿生孩子啊
<3-6,Dr. Zane>Five, okay, where am I giving birth...

104
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,880
<3-7,Phoebe>在医院还是在楼梯下的大房子里
<3-7,Phoebe>in a hospital or a big box under the stairs?

105
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,260
<3-8,Dr. Zane>我们给你植入五个胚胎是为了
<3-8,Dr. Zane>We do five because that gives you a 25% chance

106
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,810
<3-8,Dr. Zane>让其中一枚受精卵着床的机率保持在25%
<3-8,Dr. Zane>that at least one will attach.

107
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,920
<3-9,Phoebe>才25%  这么小的概率啊
<3-9,Phoebe>That's it? 25%?

108
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,920
<3-9,Phoebe>意味着我怀不上孩子的机率是75%
<3-9,Phoebe>That means that it's, like, 75% chance of no baby at all?

109
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,320
<3-10,Frank>我在想  如果植入两百个胚胎
<3-10,Frank>You know, I was thinking, what are the odds...

110
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,120
<3-10,Frank>那机率会不会高一点
<3-10,Frank>like if you stuff 200 of them in there?

111
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,030
<3-10,Frank>亲爱的  别傻了...
<3-10,Frank>Sweetie, now...

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,170
<3-11,Alice>她是个女人  不是卖泡泡糖的机器
<3-11,Alice>she's a woman, not a gumball machine.

113
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,710
<3-17,Phoebe>没关系  你们俩别担心
<3-17,Phoebe>Okay, you know what? Don't worry, you guys.

114
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,740
<3-12,Phoebe>我会一直坚持做到成功为止
<3-12,Phoebe>Cause I'll do this as many times as it takes to get it right.

115
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,500
<3-13,Frank>但是我们只有一次机会
<3-13,Frank>The thing is, we kind of only have one shot.

116
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,750
<3-14,Alice>做一次移植要花一万六千块
<3-14,Alice>It costs $16,000 each time you do this.

117
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,120
<3-14,Alice>我们为了这次  已经花光所有的积蓄
<3-14,Alice>So, we're kind of using all the money we have to do it just this one time.

118
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,660
<3-15,Phoebe>你这样一说  我和我的子宫
<3-15,Phoebe>Okay, that's a lot of pressure

119
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,440
<3-15,Phoebe>承担的压力简直太大了
<3-15,Phoebe>on me and my uterus.

120
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,570
<3-15,Phoebe>也许我能做些什么事
<3-15,Phoebe>Well, okay. So maybe there's something I can do

121
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,770
<3-15,Phoebe>来确保我一定能怀上
<3-15,Phoebe>you know, to sort of like help make sure I get pregnant.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,330
<3-16,Dr. Zane>抱歉  目前没有这种方法
<3-16,Dr. Zane>No, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,200
<3-17,Phoebe>你们怎么连这个都不知道啊
<3-17,Phoebe>Wow, you guys really don't know anything.

124
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,220
<3-18,Frank>我知道了  让她喝个烂醉吧
<3-18,Frank>I know. Why don't she get drunk?

125
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,440
<3-18,Frank>我很多高中同学都是这样搞大肚子的
<3-18,Frank>That worked for a bunch of girls in my high school.

126
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,100
<4-1,Monica>伙计们  你们意识到了吗
<4-1,Monica>Guys. Do you realize that any minute now...

127
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,590
<4-1,Monica>菲比现在随时可能会怀孕啊
<4-1,Monica>Phoebe could be pregnant?

128
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,890
<4-3,Rachel>我知道...我知道...
<4-3,Rachel>I know, I know.

129
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,000
<4-3,Rachel>这件事非同小可  足以改变她的生活
<4-3,Rachel>It's such a huge, life-altering thing.

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,390
<4-6,All>每一队都要回答十个问题
<4-6,All>Okay. Each team will answer 10 questions.

131
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,500
<4-7,Ross>答对最多的那一队就赢
