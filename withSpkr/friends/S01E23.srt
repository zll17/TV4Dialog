00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,210
<1-9,Rachel>之后每收缩一次只收五毛

<7-9,Carol>没事的  记住这样做全是为了裘帝
<7-9,Carol>It's ok, just remember we're doing this for Jordie.

152
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,020
<7-10,Susan>把注意力放在裘帝身上
<7-10,Susan>Just keep focusing on Jordie.

<7-12,Susan>不不不  我儿子不能叫裘帝
<7-12,Susan>No, no, no. I don't have a son named Jordy.

155
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,620
<7-13,Ross>我们商量好的  给他起名洁米

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,160
<7-15,Ross>你说什么呢  还是用裘帝
<7-15,Ross>What do you mean, back to Jordy?

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,740
<7-15,Ross>我们根本没讨论过裘帝
<7-15,Ross>We never landed on Jordy.
