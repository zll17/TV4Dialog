00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,080
<12-19,Frank>我居然把它搞砸了
<12-19,Frank>I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad.

268
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,620
<12-20,Phoebe>你觉得很完美
<12-20,Phoebe>You thought it was perfect?

269
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,310
<12-21,Frank>也许称不上完美
<12-21,Frank>Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect...

270
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,490
<12-21,Frank>但却很酷

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,040
<12-25,Frank>我喜欢烧东西  不喜欢不能烧的东西
<12-25,Frank>How I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

276
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,800
<12-26,Phoebe>对  好吧
<12-26,Phoebe>Right. Okay.

277
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,680
<12-27,Frank>我觉得可以对你畅所欲言
<12-27,Frank>Yeah, you know, 'cause I feel like I can really talk to you

278
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,550
<12-27,Frank>因为你是我姐姐
<12-27,Frank>because you're my sister, you know?

279
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,220
<12-28,Phoebe>是那样  我想没错
<12-28,Phoebe>Yeah. I guess I do, yeah.

280
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,140
<12-29,Frank>结果我却摸你朋友  惹你生气
<12-29,Frank>And then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.

281
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,230
<12-30,Phoebe>我也没有气到跳脚
<12-30,Phoebe>Well, I wasn't hopping mad, you know?

282
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,060
<12-31,Frank>你跳了一两下
<12-31,Frank>You hopped a little bit.

<12-35,Frank>We found ninja stars. I almost get my arm broken by a hooker.

289
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,890
<12-36,Phoebe>她不是妓女
<12-36,Phoebe>She's not a hooker.

290
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,510
<12-37,Frank>我跟朋友吹牛时  她就是
<12-37,Frank>When I tell my friends about her, she will be.

293
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,500
<13-2,Joey>为什么不直接数到二
<13-2,Joey>Why don't we just go on 2?

294
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,680
<13-3,Chandler>为什么要数到二
<13-3,Chandler>Why 2?

295
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,330
<13-4,Joey>这样比较快
<13-4,Joey>Because it's faster.

296
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,970
<13-5,Chandler>要不是你啰哩叭嗦
<13-5,Chandler>Yeah, I could've counted to 3

297
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,280
<13-5,Chandler>早就数到三了
<13-5,Chandler>like four times without all the "2" talk.

298
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,610
<13-7,Joey>-好吧  但是以后...  -好了  够了
<13-7,Joey>- All right, but in the future... - OK, Come on!

<13-8,Ross>Okay, 1, 2

301
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,020
<13-10,Ross>所以要数到二吗
<13-10,Ross>So we are going with two?

302
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,360
<13-12,Joey>乔伊  干得好

<13-14,Chandler>It's big.

304
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,280
<13-16,Chandler>是啊  大得连我的门都看不见了
<13-16,Chandler>Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!

305
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,790
<13-17,Joey>可能是我的尺子有问题
<13-17,Joey>Maybe my ruler's wrong.

306
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,720
<13-18,Phoebe>可能所有尺子都有问题
<13-18,Phoebe>Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

307
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,860
<13-19,Joey>其实还好嘛
<13-19,Joey>It's not that bad.

308
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,400
<13-19,Joey>你的挡一点 我的挡一点
<13-19,Joey>So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.

309
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,880
<13-20,Chandler>我有个更好的主意
<13-20,Chandler>Yeah. You know what, I got a better idea.

310
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,230
<13-20,Chandler>干脆不要挡我的门  都去挡你的
<13-20,Chandler>How about it blocks none of my door, and a lot of your door?

311
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,050
<13-21,Joey>先说一声  那边的油漆还没干
<13-21,Joey>Listen, before I forget, that side is still wet.
