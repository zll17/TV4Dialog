<2-17,Monica>大家都冲着我微笑
<2-17,Monica>Everyone was smiling at me,

66
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,020
<2-17,Monica>下班后才发现
<2-17,Monica>and then I get off work

67
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,420
<2-17,Monica>他们在我帽子上写了这个
<2-17,Monica>and find out they wrote this on my chef's hat.

68
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,770
<2-18,Phoebe>婊子  快辞职
<2-18,Phoebe>QUIT BITCH

69
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,190
<2-18,Phoebe>也许他们想写的是  婊子  快住嘴
<2-18,Phoebe>Maybe they meant to write "Quiet, Bitch. "

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,470
<2-18,Phoebe>怎么了
<2-18,Phoebe>What's the matter?

<2-20,Monica>我幼稚园毕业后  就没受过这种气
<2-20,Monica>I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.

73
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,190
<2-20,Monica>当时他们找了个高中生  来跟我玩翘翘板
<2-20,Monica>And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,260
<2-21,Joey>他们无所不用其极的  想逼我辞职
<2-21,Joey>They're trying to make me quit.

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,190
<2-22,Monica>换做是别的工作我早就不干了
<2-22,Monica>If it were any other job, I would.

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,590
<2-22,Monica>但我等当主厨等了大半辈子
<2-22,Monica>But I've waited for this my whole life.

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,350
<2-23,Rachel>等等  你是老大
<2-23,Rachel>Wait, you're the boss.

78
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,630
<2-23,Rachel>你为什么不吼他们  或干脆炒了他们
<2-23,Rachel>yell at them. or fire them!

79
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,440
<2-24,Monica>我也很想这样  但我最不会处理冲突场面
<2-24,Monica>I would love to, but I can't. I'm not good at confrontation.

80
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,380
<2-25,Chandler>名导奥森威尔斯在片子开拍前
<2-25,Chandler>You know what you can do? I read about this director, Orson Welles

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,620
<2-25,Chandler>都会刻意花钱请一个人  当大家面开开除他
<2-25,Chandler>who, at the beginning, would hire somebody just to fire them infront of everybody.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,550
<2-25,Chandler>好让他们知道谁说了算
<2-25,Chandler>Then they would all know who was boss.

83
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,060
<2-26,Joey>我反正没事  你干脆开除我算了
<2-26,Joey>I'm not doing anything. Why not fire me?

118
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,440
<4-4,Phoebe>但是瑞秋跟陀螺不押韵
<4-4,Phoebe>But you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

119
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,660
<4-5,Rachel>我知道
<4-5,Rachel>I know,

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,570
<4-6,Phoebe>但是要找跟你那笨名字
<4-6,Phoebe>but it's so hard.

121
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,780
<4-6,Phoebe>押韵的东西太难了
<4-6,Phoebe>Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

122
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,230
<4-7,Joey>跟瑞秋押韵的字多得很
<4-7,Joey>What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

123
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,030
<4-7,Joey>如百吉饼  信件

127
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,490
<4-8,Phoebe>你有没有比较  容易押韵的外号
<4-8,Phoebe>Do you, maybe, have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?

128
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,440
<4-9,Monica>你爸以前  不是常叫你小南瓜吗
<4-9,Monica>Didn't your dad used to call you "Pumpkin"?

129
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,200
<4-11,Phoebe>小南瓜不错  但他有没有叫过你布道夫
<4-11,Phoebe>Pumpkin? But did he ever call you "Budolph"?

<5-5,Ross>我又认识了一个女孩  现在左右为难
<5-5,Ross>This is someone else. I can't decide between the two.

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,660
<5-5,Ross>波启浦夕那个女孩虽然住得远
<5-5,Ross>The one from Poughkeepsie, though two hours away, is pretty

168
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,360
<5-5,Ross>但漂亮  聪明又有趣
<5-5,Ross>really smart and a lot of fun.

169
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,520
<5-5,Ross>但另一个女孩  就住在上城区

170
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,000
<5-5,Ross>她也很漂亮
<5-5,Ross>She's just as pretty.

<5-5,Ross>应该也蛮聪明的  但是无趣得要命
<5-5,Ross>I guess she's smart. She's not fun.

172
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,150
<5-6,Phoebe>那你为什么还要跟她约会
<5-6,Phoebe>If she's no fun, why date her at all?

173

<5-7,Ross>我想再给她一个机会  因为她家实在太近了
<5-7,Ross>I want to give her a chance. She lives so close.

174
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,020
<5-7,Ross>上次她说了一句话
<5-7,Ross>And, at the end of the date, she said something that

175
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,320
<5-7,Ross>若她在开玩笑就好笑到不行
<5-7,Ross>if she was kidding, was very funny.

176
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,560
<5-7,Ross>否则她不仅无聊  愚蠢  又有种族歧视
<5-7,Ross>If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. She's stupid and racist.

248
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,210
<10-8,Chandler>是吗  那菲比刚刚在唱什么歌
<10-8,Chandler>What was Phoebe's song about?

249
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,300
<10-9,Ross>在唱那首猫歌
<10-9,Ross>It's the one with the cat.

250
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,970
<10-9,Ross>我得走了  又有约
<10-9,Ross>I got to go. I've got another date.

251
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
<10-10,Phoebe>你决定要挑哪一个了吗
<10-10,Phoebe>Did you pick one yet?

252
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,050
<10-11,Ross>没有  上城区那个女孩  那次的确在开玩笑
<10-11,Ross>It turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.

253
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,490
<10-11,Ross>但是和我想像中的不同  而且没那么好笑
<10-11,Ross>It was a different joke. It wasn't that funny.

254
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,930
<10-11,Ross>我还是左右为难
<10-11,Ross>So I'm still torn.

255
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,190
<10-12,Phoebe>你并不喜欢上城区那个女孩
<10-12,Phoebe>You don't like the one from uptown.

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
<10-12,Phoebe>为了跟波启浦夕妞约会  又累得半死
<10-12,Phoebe>And you're exhausted from dating Poughkeepsie.

257
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,260
<10-12,Phoebe>把她们两个都甩了
<10-12,Phoebe>Just end them both!

258
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,200
<10-12,Phoebe>坐火车去波启浦夕跟她分手
<10-12,Phoebe>Take a train Go to Poughkeepsie and break up with her.

259
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,240
<10-12,Phoebe>回程跟上城妞分手
<10-12,Phoebe>Then break up with uptown.

260
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,100
<10-12,Phoebe>到家时一切都解决了
<10-12,Phoebe>By the time you get home, you're done!

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,380
<10-13,Ross>你说得对  谢谢
<10-13,Ross>You're right. Thank you.

262

<10-14,Phoebe>我在布拉格也碰过这种问题
<10-14,Phoebe>I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.

263
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,750
<10-14,Phoebe>-布拉格  -我的事你不知道的可多了
<10-14,Phoebe>-Prague? -So much you don't know.

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,730
<11-1,Rachel>派崔克刚刚跟我分手了
<11-1,Rachel>Patrick just ended things with me.

265
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:54,040
<11-1,Rachel>你有没有告诉他  我想认真谈段感情
<11-1,Rachel>Did you or didn't you tell him I wanted a serious relationship?

266
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,440
<11-2,Chandler>我有  我真的有

<11-3,Rachel>You idiot!

268
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,010
<11-4,Chandler>有道理  为什么
<11-4,Chandler>I'm sure you're right.But why?

269
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,120
<11-5,Rachel>千万不能告诉男人  你要谈段认真的感情
<11-5,Rachel>You don't tell a guy that you want a serious relationship.

270
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,360
<11-5,Rachel>你把他吓跑了
<11-5,Rachel>Now you scared him away!

271
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,460
<11-6,Chandler>对不起
<11-6,Chandler>I am sorry. I am so sorry.

272
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,750
<11-7,Rachel>应该禁止你跟别人说话
<11-7,Rachel>You should never be allowed to talk to people!

273
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,260
<11-8,Chandler>我知道
<11-8,Chandler>I know, I know!

274
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,530
<11-9,Rachel>我现在又回到原点了
<11-9,Rachel>Now I'm right back where I started.

275
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,270
<11-9,Rachel>太烂了

<11-9,Rachel>孤孤单单的真难过
<11-9,Rachel>Being alone sucks!

<11-10,Chandler>我跟同事形容你时  一句谎话都没说
<11-10,Chandler>When I told those guys about you,I didn't have to lie once.

280
