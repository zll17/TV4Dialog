<7-7,Phoebe>And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant

215
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,460
<7-7,Phoebe>充满了一切的未知和可能
<7-7,Phoebe>outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff..

216
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,080
<7-7,Phoebe>他住在一个村庄
<7-7,Phoebe>And he lived in a village,

<7-10,Rachel>But see, it was a plan.

223
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,630
<7-10,Rachel>曾经非常地清楚
<7-10,Rachel>Y'know, it was clear,

224
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,780
<7-10,Rachel>每一步都很有条理
<7-10,Rachel>and everything was figured out.

228
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,620
<7-13,Monica>我们也常不知自己何去何从
<7-13,Monica>I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going.

229
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,040
<7-13,Monica>你得仔细想清楚
<7-13,Monica>You've just gotta figure at some point

230
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
<7-13,Monica>自然就能步上轨道
<7-13,Monica>it's all gonna come together,

231
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,480
<7-13,Monica>这样才能  诸事顺利
