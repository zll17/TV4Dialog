00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,630
<1-4,CHANDLER>如果我老去接电话  大家会以为我很闲
<1-4,CHANDLER>I figure if I always answer the phone, people will think I have no life.

<1-5,JADE>but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was,

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,530
<1-5,JADE>我知道都已经三年了

50
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,320
<2-3,ROSS>就算你装鲍勃装得很像
<2-3,ROSS>You know you do do a good Bob impression...

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,450
<2-3,ROSS>等她明天一看到你
<2-3,ROSS>I'm thinking when she sees you tomorrow...

52
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,730
<2-3,ROSS>就会发现你不是鲍勃本人了
<2-3,ROSS>...she may realize you're not Bob.

53
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,040
<2-4,CHANDLER>我只希望当她知道鲍勃放她鸽子的时候
<2-4,CHANDLER>I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up...

54
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,770
<2-4,CHANDLER>她会投向邻桌陌生人的怀抱
<2-4,CHANDLER>...she'll seek comfort in the arms of the stranger at the next table.

55
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,700
<2-5,ROSS>老天  你真是坏到骨子里去了

149
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,120
<5-21,CHANDLER>因为我不能跟她说我的号码是我的号码
<5-21,CHANDLER>because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,350
<5-21,CHANDLER>因为她以为我的号码是鲍勃的号码
<5-21,CHANDLER>because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.

158
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,060
<5-27,JOEY>会不会便宜点

198
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,430

<5-55,JOEY>...feel like that...

199
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,890
<5-55,JOEY>你们有时候不太明白
<5-55,JOEY>...sometimes you guys don't get that....

200
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
<5-55,JOEY>我们没你们那么有钱
<5-55,JOEY>We don't have as much money as you.

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,070
<5-60,ROSS>我想我只是从没想过钱是个问题
<5-60,ROSS>I guess I just never think of money as an issue.

207
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,850
<5-62,ROSS>-那是因为你有钱  -说得好
<5-62,ROSS>- Because you have it. - That's a good point!

208
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,810
<5-63,CHANDLER>你们以前怎么没提过这个问题呢
<5-63,CHANDLER>So how come you guys haven't talked about this before?

209
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,020
<5-64,JOEY>因为总是有事要庆祝  像摩妮卡升职
<5-64,JOEY>Because it's always something. Like with Monica's new job...

210
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,210
<5-64,JOEY>或是罗斯的生日狂欢
<5-64,JOEY>...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

211
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,370
<5-65,ROSS>我可不希望我的生日让大家不开心
<5-65,ROSS>I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative....

212
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,040
<5-65,ROSS>你们要为我搞狂欢吗
<5-65,ROSS>There's gonna be a hoopla?

213
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,470
<5-66,RACHEL>基本上有这项安排  事后还有一些东西
<5-66,RACHEL>Basically there's the thing, and then the stuff after the thing

214
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,640
<5-67,MONICA>我们也可以不管那项安排
<5-67,MONICA>If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing...

215
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,430
<5-67,MONICA>只送礼物就好了
<5-67,MONICA>...and we'll just do the gift.

216
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,620
<5-68,ROSS>礼物  礼物不就是那项安排吗
<5-68,ROSS>Gift? The thing's not the gift?

217
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,880
<5-69,CHANDLER>不  那项安排是一起去看混混与自大狂
<5-69,CHANDLER>No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.

219
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,620
<9-17,JOEY>混混与自大狂
<9-17,JOEY>Hootie and the...

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,590
<5-70,ROSS>我可以到时听广播
<5-70,ROSS>I can catch them on the radio.

221
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,270
<5-71,PHOEBE>不  现在我愧疚了  你想去看现场演唱会的
<5-71,PHOEBE>No. Now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.

222
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,850
<5-72,ROSS>不  听着  这是我的生日
<5-72,ROSS>No, look. It's my birthday...

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,260
<5-72,ROSS>重要的是我们大家一起过
<5-72,ROSS>...and the important thing is that we're all be together.

224
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,480
<5-73,MONICA>-全部  -一起过
<5-73,MONICA>- All of us. - Together.

<5-80,PHOEBE>-好  谢谢  -谢了
<5-80,PHOEBE>- Okay, thank you. - Thanks.

<5-81,CHANDLER>那个依波拉病毒  被感染到一定很惨
<5-81,CHANDLER>So, the Ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?

229
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,770
<6-1,CHANDLER>天呐  摩妮卡  袋子里装的什么
<6-1,CHANDLER>Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?

230
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,190
<6-2,MONICA>不知道  钱德勒 咱们看一下吧
<6-2,MONICA>I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.

231
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,220
<6-3,PHOEBE>像在演滑稽短剧
<6-3,PHOEBE>Oh, it's like a skit.

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,900
<6-4,MONICA>和一根给菲比的茄子
<6-4,MONICA>...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

234
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,890
<6-6,PHOEBE>我们餐厅换了肉食供应商
<6-6,PHOEBE>We switched meat suppliers at work,

235
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,380
<6-7,MONICA>新供应商送了我这些牛排谢我
<6-7,MONICA>and the new guys gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

<6-8,ROSS>等等  还有  钱德勒  那信封里还有什么
<6-8,ROSS>But wait, there's more. Chandler, what is in that envelope?

237
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,230
<6-9,CHANDLER>对了  刚才在外面排演时那没么蹩脚的
<6-9,CHANDLER>By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.

<6-14,ROSS>Could you be less enthused?

244
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,460
<6-14,ROSS>各位  你们是一番好意没错
<6-14,ROSS>Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

245
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,430
<6-15,JOEY>可是我们觉得这像
<6-15,JOEY>But it just feels like....

246
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,910
<6-16,MONICA>像什么
<6-16,MONICA>Like?

247
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,810
<6-17,JOEY>施舍
<6-17,JOEY>Charity.

248
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,090
<6-17,JOEY>施舍
<6-17,JOEY>Charity?

249
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,770
<6-19,ROSS>我们只是想让大家高兴
<6-19,ROSS>We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

250
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,800
<6-20,RACHEL>罗斯  可你们的好意让我们觉得我们这么渺小
<6-20,RACHEL>Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.

251
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,840
<6-21,PHOEBE>事实上  是这么小
<6-21,PHOEBE>Actually, it makes us feel that big.

252
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,100
<6-22,ROSS>我不懂  我们怎样做都不对
<6-22,ROSS>I don't understand. We can't win with you guys.

253
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,240
<6-23,CHANDLER>你们觉得那么渺小的话  那或许不是我们的错
<6-23,CHANDLER>If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.

254
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
<6-23,CHANDLER>或许只是因为你们感觉有问题
<6-23,CHANDLER>Maybe that's just how you feel.

255
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,140
<6-24,JOEY>现在我们的感觉要你们来说了
<6-24,JOEY>Now you're telling us how we feel.

256
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,670
<6-25,RACHEL>你看  我们根本就不该提这事的
<6-25,RACHEL>Ok, we never should have talked about this.

257
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,340
<6-26,PHOEBE>我想我不去演唱会了
<6-26,PHOEBE>I'm gonna pass on the concert.

258
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,510
<6-26,PHOEBE>因为我现在不太有心情去混
<6-26,PHOEBE>I'm just not in a very "Hootie" place right now.

259
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,400
<6-27,RACHEL>-我也是  -我也是
<6-27,RACHEL>- Me neither. - Me too.

00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,990
<6-29,MONICA>各位  我们票都已经买好了
<6-29,MONICA>Guys, we bought the tickets.

261
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,890
<6-30,PHOEBE>那你们就有空座放头冠什么的了
<6-30,PHOEBE>Then you'll have extra seats for all your tiaras and stuff.

262
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,680
<6-31,CHANDLER>你说这话的时候为什么盯着我看
<6-31,CHANDLER>Why did you look at me when you said that?

263
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,330
<6-32,MONICA>这下子我们都不能去了
<6-32,MONICA>So I guess now we can't go.

264
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,330
<6-33,RACHEL>你们想去就去啊  我们非得集体行动不可吗
<6-33,RACHEL>Do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?

265
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,980
<6-34,MONICA>知道吗  你说得对
<6-34,MONICA>You know what? You're right.

266
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,020
<5-49,MONICA>很好
<5-49,MONICA>Fine.

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,010
<5-51,PHOEBE>很好
<5-51,PHOEBE>Fine.

269
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,930
<5-51,PHOEBE>很好
<5-51,PHOEBE>Fine.

270
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,670
<5-51,PHOEBE>很好
<5-51,PHOEBE>Fine.

271
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,840
<6-38,CHANDLER>好吧
<6-38,CHANDLER>All right.

272
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,470
<6-39,RACHEL>我们会去的
<6-39,RACHEL>We're gonna go.

273
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,380
<6-40,MONICA>不过还有六个小时  我们到时候再去
<6-40,MONICA>It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.

274
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,860
<6-42,CHANDLER>-钱德勒  -在
<6-42,CHANDLER>- Chandler. - Yeah.

275
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,830
<6-43,ROSS>天啊  你准备好了吗
<6-43,ROSS>Are you ready?

276
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,060
<6-44,CHANDLER>好了  等我先拿个外套  还有我今天上床了
<6-44,CHANDLER>Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.

277
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,260
<6-45,ROSS>什么  你今天上床了
<6-45,ROSS>What? You had sex today?

278
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,980
<6-46,CHANDLER>从别人嘴里说出来感觉更酷
<6-46,CHANDLER>It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it!

279
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,580
<6-46,CHANDLER>我很厉害  我让她爽到咬住嘴唇才忍住叫声
<6-46,CHANDLER>I was awesome. She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.

280
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,340
<6-48,CHANDLER>我知道我很久没有这样了  但我认为这是好现象
<6-48,CHANDLER>I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.

281
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,260
<6-49,ROSS>你还在过滤电话吗
<6-49,ROSS>Still doing the screening thing?

282
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,580
<6-49,ROSS>我今天上床了
<6-49,ROSS>I had sex today.

283
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,850
<6-50,CHANDLER>我再也不用去接那个电话了
<6-50,CHANDLER>I never have to answer that phone again.

284
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,030
<6-51,MACHINE>听到哔声后  自觉留言吧
<6-51,MACHINE>At the sound of the beep, you know what to do.

285
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,230
<6-52,JADE>鲍勃  我是洁德  听着
<6-52,JADE>Hey, Bob. It's Jade. Listen.

286
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,500
<6-52,JADE>你那天放我鸽子  我难过极了
<6-52,JADE>I wanted to tell you I was really hurt when you didn 't show up yesterday.

287
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,070
<6-52,JADE>结果你知道吗   我认识了另一个人
<6-52,JADE>And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.

288
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,950
<6-54,JADE>我是鲍勃
<6-54,JADE>Bob here.

289
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,380
<6-55,CHANDLER>你认识了别人
<6-55,CHANDLER>So you met someone, huh?

290
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,000
<6-56,JADE>没错
<6-56,JADE>Yes, I did.

291
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,250
<6-56,JADE>事实上  我两小时前还跟他上床了
<6-56,JADE>In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

292
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,290
<6-57,CHANDLER>那他表现怎么样
<6-57,CHANDLER>So how was he?

293
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,340
<6-60,JADE>鲍勃  他跟你没法比
<6-60,JADE>Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.

294
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,470
<6-60,JADE>我拼命咬住嘴唇才忍住没叫出你的名字
<6-60,JADE>I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.

295
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,690
<6-61,CHANDLER>很高兴听你这么讲
<6-61,CHANDLER>Well, that makes me feel so good.

296
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,110
<6-62,JADE>他的技术太差了
<6-62,JADE>It was just so awkward and bumpy.

297
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,500
<6-64,CHANDLER>或许是因为他用了些你不熟悉的新招式
<6-64,CHANDLER>Maybe he had some kind of new cool style that you're not familiar with.

298
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,620
<6-65,JADE>你习惯就好了
<6-65,JADE>You have to get used to it.

299
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,520
<6-65,JADE>没多少时间让我去习惯了
<6-65,JADE>There wasn 't much time to get used to it...

300
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,650
<6-65,JADE>懂我的意思吗
<6-65,JADE>...if you know what I mean.

301
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,220
<7-1,MONICA>我现在没心情看演唱会
<7-1,MONICA>You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

302
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,380
<7-2,ROSS>我知道  这是我的生日  我们该聚在一起的
<7-2,ROSS>I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.

303
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,330
<7-3,CHANDLER>那就走吧
<7-3,CHANDLER>So let's go.

304
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,840
<7-4,ROSS>或许我们应该听一首再走
<7-4,ROSS>Well, maybe we should stay for one song.

305
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,670
<7-5,CHANDLER>对  现在离开对他们很不礼貌
<7-5,CHANDLER>Yeah. It would be rude to them for us to leave now.

306
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,920
<7-6,MONICA>说不定他们现在正玩得很开心呢
<7-6,MONICA>The guys are probably having a great time.

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,020
<9-8,ROSS>除此之外  我们昨天整晚都很不顺
<9-8,ROSS>Aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,470
<9-9,CHANDLER>对  我们很想念你们
<9-9,CHANDLER>Yeah, we really missed you guys.

<9-10,JOEY>对  我们刚才还说  这件事实在是太小儿科了
<9-10,JOEY>Yeah, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.

339
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,330
<9-11,PHOEBE>我们绝不能
<9-11,PHOEBE>We just have to really, really not

340
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,180
<9-11,PHOEBE>让钱这种事影响
<9-11,PHOEBE>let stuff like money, get like

341
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,630
<9-11,PHOEBE>那是草莓印吗
<9-11,PHOEBE>Is that a hickey?

342
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,600
<9-12,MONICA>不  我只是
<9-12,MONICA>Oh, no, I just....

343
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,860
<9-12,MONICA>我跌倒了
<9-12,MONICA>I fell down.

344
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,800
<9-13,RACHEL>跌在别人嘴上
<9-13,RACHEL>On someone's lips?

345
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,030
<9-13,RACHEL>你那草莓印哪里来的
<9-13,RACHEL>Where'd you get the hickey?

346
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,350
<9-14,MONICA>派对或
<9-14,MONICA>You know, a party or

347
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,250
<9-15,RACHEL>什么派对
<9-15,RACHEL>What party?

348
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,510
<9-16,ROSS>也不算是派对  只能算是
<9-16,ROSS>It wasn't a party so much as a...

349
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,690
<9-16,ROSS>一群人聚在一起
<9-16,ROSS>...a gathering of people.

350
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,190
<9-16,ROSS>有吃的  有音乐  还有
<9-16,ROSS>With food and music and...

351
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,150
<9-18,CHANDLER>乐团
<9-18,CHANDLER>...and the band.

352
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,810
<9-17,JOEY>你们跟混混与自大狂狂欢了
<9-17,JOEY>You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?

353
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:12,290
<9-18,CHANDLER>对  很显然史蒂夫跟混混是死党
<9-18,CHANDLER>Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie are like this.

354
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,820
<9-19,RACHEL>那草莓是谁种的
<9-19,RACHEL>Who gave you that hickey?

355
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,610
<9-20,MONICA>是其中一个自大狂弄的
<9-20,MONICA>That would be the work of a Blowfish.

356
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,360
<9-21,RACHEL>我真不敢相信
<9-21,RACHEL>I can't believe it! I can't believe this!

357
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,470
<9-22,PHOEBE>我们呆坐在家里  猜乔伊的手指头
<9-22,PHOEBE>We're just sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers...

358
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,900
<9-22,PHOEBE>而你们却跑出去狂欢作乐
<9-22,PHOEBE>...and you guys are partying and having fun and all:

359
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,470
<9-22,PHOEBE>还喊着  自大狂  吸我脖子
<9-22,PHOEBE>"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

360
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,510
<9-23,ROSS>不要怪我们  本来你们也可以去的
<9-23,ROSS>Don't blame us. You could've been there.

361
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,060
<9-24,RACHEL>什么  当接受你们施舍的穷朋友吗
<9-24,RACHEL>What? As part of your "poor friends outreach program"?

362
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,420
<9-25,MONICA>这下可好  有公事  能借电话用吗
<9-25,MONICA>Oh, great. It's work. Can I?

363
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,120
<9-26,CHANDLER>我不晓得该说什么  很抱歉我们赚的钱比你们多
<9-26,CHANDLER>I don't know what to say. I'm sorry we make more money than you.

364
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,610
<9-26,CHANDLER>可我们不会因此感到愧疚  因为我们工作很努力
<9-26,CHANDLER>But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.

365
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,970
<9-27,JOEY>我们就不努力吗
<9-27,JOEY>And we don't work hard?

<9-28,MONICA>我是摩妮卡  我刚收到寻呼
<9-28,MONICA>It's Monica. I just got a page.

367
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,490
<9-29,CHANDLER>有时我们会想做比较花钱的事
<9-29,CHANDLER>It's just that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.

368
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,480
<9-30,JOEY>是我们拖你们后腿了
<9-30,JOEY>And you feel like we hold you back.

373
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,560
<9-33,CHANDLER>那些牛排只是肉商送来的礼物
<9-33,CHANDLER>Those steaks were a gift from the meat vendor.

374
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,210
<9-33,CHANDLER>那不是回扣
<9-33,CHANDLER>That was not a kickback.

<9-39,JADE>Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

386
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,610
<9-39,JADE>都过三年了  说不定你另交女友了
<9-39,JADE>It's been three years, and you 're probably seeing someone else now...

387
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,760
<9-39,JADE>可看在我们以往的情分上  能不能共度一夜
<9-39,JADE>...but if we could have one night together, for old time 's sake....
