00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,870
<4-17,Chandler>-她不是才刚来  -对啊
<4-17,Chandler>- Didn't she, like, just get here?  - Yeah!

138
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,460
<4-19,Chandler>别激动  大哥
<4-19,Chandler>Easy, tiger.

139
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,360
<4-20,Ross>我好讨厌这样
<4-20,Ross>I just, I hate this so much.

140
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,210
<4-20,Ross>每次去机场接她  我都好开心
<4-20,Ross>Every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.

141
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,960
<4-20,Ross>但是我又会想
<4-20,Ross>But at the same time I'm thinking,

142
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,170
<4-20,Ross>过两天又要送她来机场了
<4-20,Ross>"I'll be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."

143
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,310
<4-21,Chandler>-那你要怎么办  -没办法
<4-21,Chandler>- So what are you gonna do?  - Nothing. There's nothing to do.

144
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,920
<4-22,Ross>她住在那里  我住在这里
<4-22,Ross>She lives there. I live here.

145
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,290
<4-22,Ross>她得搬来这里
<4-22,Ross>She'd have to move here.

146
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,760
<4-22,Ross>她应该搬来这里
<4-22,Ross>She should move here.

147
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,590
<4-23,Joey>什么
<4-23,Joey>What?

148
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,450
<4-24,Ross>-我可以叫她跟我住  -你说真的吗
<4-24,Ross>- I can ask her to live with me.  - Are you serious?

149
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,300
<4-26,Ross>为什么不行
<4-26,Ross>Why not? I mean, why not?

150
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,780
<4-26,Ross>你才认识她6星期
<4-26,Ross>You've only known her six weeks!

151
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,800
<4-27,Chandler>我冰箱里有盒牛奶
<4-27,Chandler>I've got a carton of milk in my fridge

152
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,550
<4-27,Chandler>都不止放了六星期
<4-27,Chandler>I've had a longer relationship with.

153
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,050
<4-28,Ross>我跟她在一起时  就好像...
<4-28,Ross>Look, guys, when I'm with her, it's like...

154
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,940
<4-28,Ross>她会激发出我好的一面
<4-28,Ross>She brings out this great side of me.

155
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,950
<4-28,Ross>我爱她  知道吗
<4-28,Ross>I mean, I love her, you know?

156
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,620
<4-29,Chandler>我也爱那盒牛奶
<4-29,Chandler>And I love the milk!

157
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,140
<4-29,Chandler>但我不会要一个英国女孩跟我同居
<4-29,Chandler>But I won't ask some British girl to move in with me.

158
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,070
<4-29,Chandler>乔伊  该你说了
<4-29,Chandler>Joey, you say things now.

159
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,350
<4-30,Joey>罗斯  他说得对  艾蜜莉很好
<4-30,Joey>Look, Ross. He's right. Emily's great.

160
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,390
<4-30,Joey>她很棒
<4-30,Joey>She's great!

161
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,470
<4-30,Joey>但这样太快了  你只会吓到她
<4-30,Joey>But this is way too soon. You're only gonna scare her.

162
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,550
<4-31,Ross>我不想吓到她
<4-31,Ross>I don't want to do that.

163
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,100
<4-32,Joey>没错  别坏了好事  别太心急
<4-32,Joey>You don't want to wreck it. Don't go too fast.

164
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,820
<4-33,Ross>你们说得对  我明白了
<4-33,Ross>No. You're right. I know, you're right.

165
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,390
<4-33,Ross>我不会这样
<4-33,Ross>I'm not going to do it.

166
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,310
<4-33,Ross>-谢了  两位  -客气
<4-33,Ross>- Thanks guys. - No problem.

168
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,590
<4-34,Chandler>摇滚时一定要叫醒我
<4-34,Chandler>Just remember to wake us up before you go-go.

169
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,260
<5-1,Phoebe>这太难了  太难了
<5-1,Phoebe>It's too hard. Too hard!

170
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,870
<5-2,Monica>两位  赢得季票的最后机会
<5-2,Monica>All right boys. Last chance for the tickets.

171
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,240
<5-3,Rachel>否则我就送给我的新男友约书亚
<5-3,Rachel>Otherwise, I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.

172
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,380
<5-4,Chandler>不用了  谢谢
<5-4,Chandler>No, thank you.

173
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,390
<5-5,Joey>等一下  拜托  跟她们换啦
<5-5,Joey>Wait, wait. Come on, come on! Let's trade.

174
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,860
<5-5,Joey>时机正好  我刚把马桶堵住
<5-5,Joey>The timing's perfect! I just clogged the toilet!

175
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,450
<5-6,Chandler>我跟你一样想要球票
<5-6,Chandler>I want those basketball seats as much as you do.

176
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,410
<5-6,Chandler>但是住过了大房决不能搬回去
<5-6,Chandler>But we can't live in the smaller apartment after living here!

177
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,350
<5-6,Chandler>你没看过《献给阿尔杰农的花》吗
<5-6,Chandler>Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?

179
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,350
<5-6,Chandler>看过
<5-6,Chandler>Yes.

180
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,420
<5-7,Joey>你没看过《运动画报》吗
<5-7,Joey>Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?

181
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,110
<5-7,Joey>没  我没偷看你的
<5-7,Joey>No, I didn't read yours!

182
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,410
<5-7,Joey>我们晚上就可以去看球
<5-7,Joey>Come on. We can go to the game tonight!

183
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,120
<5-8,Chandler>听着  想让我考虑换
<5-8,Chandler>Look, the only way I'll consider this is

184
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,760
<5-8,Chandler>除非她们提出比季票更好的东西
<5-8,Chandler>if they offer a lot more than just season seats.

185
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,450
<5-10,Chandler>-是尼克斯队耶!  -去他的尼克斯克队
<5-10,Chandler>- It's the Knicks! - Screw the Knicks!

186
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,310
<5-11,Joey>我不是那个意思  我是说
<5-11,Joey>I didn't mean that. I just meant that

187
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,470
<5-12,Chandler>这间公寓的价值要更大
<5-12,Chandler>the apartment is won'th so much more.

188
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,260
<5-14,Chandler>尼克斯队万岁
<5-14,Chandler>And the Knicks rule all.

189
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,950
<5-15,Joey>对  尼克斯队万岁
<5-15,Joey>Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

190
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,250
<5-16,Phoebe>怎样  要不要
<5-16,Phoebe>So? Are you going to do it?

191
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,130
<5-16,Phoebe>不要
<5-16,Phoebe>No, we're not going to do that.

192
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,660
<5-17,Chandler>因为这个交易不公平
<5-17,Chandler>You know why? Because it's not an even trade.

193
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,680
<5-18,Rachel>好  听着
<5-18,Rachel>All right, okay, look.

194
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,160
<5-18,Rachel>要是你们能保住公寓又拿到球票呢
<5-18,Rachel>What if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?

195
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,230
<5-19,Joey>成交
<5-19,Joey>Done!

196
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,560
<5-21,Joey>让我说完  我是说我们来赌
<5-21,Joey>Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.

197
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,540
<5-22,Rachel>赢的人通杀
<5-22,Rachel>Winner takes all.

198
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,170
<5-23,Joey>我们可能输光光
<5-23,Joey>We could end up with nothing.

199
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,530
<5-24,Phoebe>或是通杀
<5-24,Phoebe>Or you could end up with everything.

200
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,530
<5-25,Joey>我喜欢
<5-25,Joey>I like that.

201
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,700
<5-27,Chandler>-怎么样?  -不
<5-27,Chandler>- What do you say?  -No.

202
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,960
<5-28,Monica>赌吧
<5-28,Monica>Just do it!

203
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,430
<5-29,Chandler>真有说服力啊
<5-29,Chandler>Oh! I'm convinced!

204
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,490
<5-30,Joey>拜托啦  我也会为你这么做
<5-30,Joey>Come on, man! You know I'd do it for you.

205
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,570
<5-30,Joey>因为你是我最好的朋友
<5-30,Joey>Because you're my best friend.

206
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,930
<5-31,Chandler>好吧  但你1整年不准再用这招
<5-31,Chandler>All right. But you can't use that again for a whole year.

207
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,620
<5-32,Joey>我赌了
<5-32,Joey>I'm in.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,500
<5-33,Phoebe>好激动人心  你们要赌什么
<5-33,Phoebe>This is so exciting! What are you going to bet?

209
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,370
<5-34,Rachel>我们就让菲比决定
<5-34,Rachel>I think we should let Phoebe decide

210
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,100
<5-34,Rachel>因为只有她没有利害关系
<5-34,Rachel>because she's the only one who's impartial,

211
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,430
<5-34,Rachel>而且她好美
<5-34,Rachel>and she's so pretty.

212
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,810
<5-35,Phoebe>我想到一个游戏
<5-35,Phoebe>I have a game!

213
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,560
<5-39,Joey>-很棒喔  -是什么游戏
<5-39,Joey>- This is great! - What's the game? What's the game?

214
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,720
<5-40,Phoebe>没有名字  就叫菲比球吧
<5-40,Phoebe>It doesn't have a name. No, okay. Phoebe Ball!

215
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,010
<5-40,Phoebe>不  没有名字
<5-40,Phoebe>No, it doesn't have a name.

216
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,290
<5-40,Phoebe>莫妮卡
<5-40,Phoebe>Okay, Monica.

217
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,950
<5-40,Phoebe>你最喜欢树的哪一点
<5-40,Phoebe>What is your favorite thing about trees?

218
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,100
<5-42,Phoebe>-树是绿色的  -很好  加5分
<5-42,Phoebe>- They're green? - Good! Five points!

219
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,290
<5-43,Phoebe>乔伊  同样的问题
<5-43,Phoebe>Joey. Same question.

220
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,210
<5-45,Phoebe>-树很高  -3分
<5-45,Phoebe>- They're tall. - Three points!

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,410
<5-45,Phoebe>都答得很好  但标准答案是叶子多
<5-45,Phoebe>Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy. Leafy.

222
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,620
<5-46,Monica>这游戏说不通
<5-46,Monica>That's not even a game.

223
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,490
<5-47,Rachel>闭嘴  我们领先
<5-47,Rachel>Shut up. We're winning!

224
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,130
<5-48,Monica>你们想速战速决吗
<5-48,Monica>You want to finish this right now?

234
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,130

<6-5,Ross>我知道听起来很疯狂  别人会说太快了
<6-5,Ross>I know it sounds crazy, and people will say it's too soon,

260
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,420
<6-5,Ross>但是你想想  那样多棒啊
<6-5,Ross>but just think. Think how great it would be.

261
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,880
<6-7,Ross>我不知道
<6-7,Ross>I don't know.

262
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,440
<6-6,Emily>要我离开伦敦...

<6-8,Emily>-我的工作  -你可以在这里找工作
<6-8,Emily>- My job. - You'll get a job here.

265
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,190
<6-9,Ross>我常听说外国人到来
<6-9,Ross>I always hear about the foreigners coming in

266
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,720
<6-9,Ross>把美国人的工作都抢走了
<6-9,Ross>and stealing American jobs.

267
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,080
<6-9,Ross>你也可以
<6-9,Ross>That could be you.

268
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,500
<6-10,Emily>但事关我的人生

<6-11,Ross>我不能离开他  没别的办法了吗
<6-11,Ross>I can't leave him. You don't think there's any way?

272
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,540
<6-12,Emily>我看是没有了
<6-12,Emily>I don't think so.

273
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,680
<6-12,Emily>如果是长久的打算就不同了
<6-12,Emily>It would be different if it was way into the future

274
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,960
<6-12,Emily>例如结婚什么的
<6-12,Emily>and we were getting married.

275
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,060
<6-13,Ross>什么

276
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,130
<6-14,Emily>好  我不该提结婚的

<6-14,Emily>别被我吓到
<6-14,Emily>Please don't go freaky on me.

<6-14,Emily>我不是认真的  我收回
<6-14,Emily>I didn't mean it. I didn't say it. I take it back.

279
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,500
<6-15,Ross>不  不要收回
<6-15,Ross>No. Don't.

280
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,870
<6-16,Emily>何不就这么做
<6-16,Emily>Why don't we?

281
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
<6-16,Emily>做什么

<6-18,Emily>No, I'm not! It's perfect.

285
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,220
<6-19,Ross>比你搬来住更棒
<6-19,Ross>It's better than you moving here.

286
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,720
<6-19,Ross>我们可以永远在一起  这才是我想要的
<6-19,Ross>It's us together forever, and that's what I want.

<6-20,Emily>-我们才认识6星期  -我知道
<6-20,Emily>- We've known each other 6 weeks!  - I know.

288
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,730
<6-20,Emily>那又怎样  谁说不行  这样就不行吗
<6-20,Emily>So what? Who's to say?  Does that mean we can't do it?

289
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,440
<6-21,Ross>听着  我跟卡罗尔在一起4年才结婚
<6-21,Ross>Look. I was with Carol for four years before we got married...

290
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,410
<6-21,Ross>结果我跟一个怀孕的拉拉离婚
<6-21,Ross>...and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian.

291
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,030
<6-21,Ross>这么做...
<6-21,Ross>I mean, this...

292
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,350
<6-21,Ross>对我们是顺理成章
<6-21,Ross>This makes sense for us.

<6-21,Ross>我们第一次约会就跑去佛蒙特度周末
<6-21,Ross>Our first date, we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont.

<6-21,Ross>I mean, last night I got my ear pierced. Me!

295
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,070
<6-21,Ross>我们在一起感觉很对

296
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,010
<6-21,Ross>不是吗
<6-21,Ross>Doesn't it?

297

304
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,440
<6-32,Emily>有一点小
<6-32,Emily>It's a bit small.

305
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,930
<6-33,Ross>真是的  我还以为这样会很浪漫
<6-33,Ross>Damn! I thought that'd be romantic as hell.

306
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,400
<6-34,Emily>是很浪漫
<6-34,Emily>It was.

307

<7-2,Joey>要不要把衣服送给她们表示和解
<7-2,Joey>Should we give these to the girls? Like a peace offering?

309
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,080
<7-3,Chandler>好主意  反正不要钱又太小
<7-3,Chandler>That's very nice. Plus, they were free and too small.

310
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,010
<7-4,Chandler>天哪
<7-4,Chandler>Oh, God!

311
