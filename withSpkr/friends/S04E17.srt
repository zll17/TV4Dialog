1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,720
<1-1,Mr. Treeger>天呐
<1-1,Mr. Treeger>Oh, man!

2
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,700
<1-3,Chandler>-怎么回事  -崔格在通洗澡间的下水道
<1-3,Chandler>- What's that? - Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,750
<1-4,Mr. Treeger>这是什么鬼东西
<1-4,Mr. Treeger>What in the name of hell?

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,480
<1-5,Joey>可能是你的人字拖
<1-5,Joey>Maybe he found your flip-flop.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,930
<1-6,Chandler>这是A片吗
<1-6,Chandler>Is this porn?

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,680
<1-7,Joey>怎么了  我一定是按到什么了
<1-7,Joey>What I'm doing? I must have hit something on the remote.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,520
<1-8,Chandler>我们有付钱吗
<1-8,Chandler>Do we pay for this?

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,580
<1-9,Joey>不  我们连有线电视费都没给
<1-9,Joey>No! We didn't even pay our cable bill.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,180
<1-9,Joey>也许这是他们的处罚方式
<1-9,Joey>Maybe this is how they punish us.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,140
<1-10,Chandler>也许我们应该欠电话费  免费色情电话哦
<1-10,Chandler>Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill. Free phone sex.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,620
<1-11,Joey>也许我们应该欠煤气费
<1-11,Joey>Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,080
<1-12,Mr. Treeger>看啊  那位小姐没穿衣服
<1-12,Mr. Treeger>Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,520
<1-13,Chandler>乔伊不知道按了什么  它就冒了出来
<1-13,Chandler>Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just came on.

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,820
<1-14,Mr. Treeger>我有一次也按到过  突然就出来了
<1-14,Mr. Treeger>Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam!

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,400
<1-14,Mr. Treeger>跟检到钱一样爽
<1-14,Mr. Treeger>It was like finding money.

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,480
<1-15,Chandler>还是印有春宫图的钱
<1-15,Chandler>Like finding money with naked people on it!

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,990
<1-16,Mr. Treeger>但我错手把电视关掉了
<1-16,Mr. Treeger>But I made the mistake of turning off the TV.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,030
<1-16,Mr. Treeger>之后就再也找不到了
<1-16,Mr. Treeger>I never got it back again.

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,270
<1-16,Mr. Treeger>我好伤心
<1-16,Mr. Treeger>And I'm sad.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,260
<1-17,Joey>他干嘛要关电视
<1-17,Joey>Why would he turn off the TV?

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,820
<2-1,Rachel>拜托  吃饭的时候一定要看这个吗
<2-1,Rachel>All right, you know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,730
<2-3,Chandler>我们不知道  哪种行为会让它消失
<2-3,Chandler>We don't know what could make this go away.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,610
<2-4,Joey>所以谁都不许碰遥控器  也不许碰电视
<2-4,Joey>So no one touches the remote, and no one touches the TV..

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,810
<2-5,Chandler>连电视周围的空气都不能扰动
<2-5,Chandler>And no one touches the air around the TV.

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,010
<2-6,Joey>就像有一个A片保护罩
<2-6,Joey>Imagine a protective porn bubble, if you will.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,720
<2-7,Monica>起码也要静音
<2-7,Monica>I'm at least going to mute it.

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,130
<2-9,Chandler>A片还在
<2-9,Chandler>We still have porn.

43
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,750
<2-11,Phoebe>你干什么  那个很重的  给我
<2-11,Phoebe>What are you doing? That's too heavy. Give it here.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,970
<2-13,Rachel>哦  天呐
<2-13,Rachel>Oh, God.

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,550
<2-15,Rachel>我怀孕了  再也没法扛着按摩桌到处跑了
<2-15,Rachel>I'm too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,230
<2-17,Phoebe>我得找个桌子小一点的工作
<2-17,Phoebe>I need a job with a smaller table.

47
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,200
<2-18,Chandler>或是不需要桌子的工作
<2-18,Chandler>Or a job without a carry table

48
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,650
<2-19,Phoebe>你的意思是  比如医生
<2-19,Phoebe>You mean, like a doctor?

49
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,190
<2-20,Joey>菲比  你挡到A片了
<2-20,Joey>Pheebe, you're blocking the porn! Come om!

50
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,120
<2-21,Phoebe>这让我想起今天我还要做产检
<2-21,Phoebe>That reminds me. I have to see my ob-gyn today.

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,790
<3-3,Ross>艾蜜莉去机场了
<3-3,Ross>Emily just went to the airport.

52
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,780
<3-4,Monica>你怎么不去送送她
<3-4,Monica>Why didn't you take her?

53
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,240
<3-5,Ross>她叔叔早就讲好要送她了
<3-5,Ross>Her uncle had already planned to do it.

54
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,790
<3-5,Ross>我们今天早上告过别了
<3-5,Ross>We said our goodbyes this morning.

55
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,910
<3-6,Monica>你一定很难受
<3-6,Monica>You must feel horrible.

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,190
<3-6,Monica>对了  隔壁有免费的A片
<3-6,Monica>Hey, the guys have free porn.

<3-8,Monica>高兴一点  你们会再见面的
<3-8,Monica>Hey, cheer up. You gonna see her again, right?

58
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,990
<3-9,Ross>就因为我不知道
<3-9,Ross>That's the thing. I don't know.

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,400
<3-9,Ross>每当我提起  她就说
<3-9,Ross>When I brought it up her, she said. . .

60
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,730
<3-9,Ross>这样就很棒了  何必谈到未来
<3-9,Ross>"This is so fantastic. Why talk about the future?

61
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,060
<3-10,Monica>-我们就享受...  -别学英国腔
<3-10,Monica>- Let's enjoy...  - Don't do the accent.

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,110
<3-10,Monica>你会再见到她的
<3-10,Monica>You've got to see her again.

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,120
<3-11,Ross>-你为什么这么在意  -因为我...
<3-11,Ross>- Why do you care so much? - Because...

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,710
<3-12,Monica>因为你可以实现我的幻想
<3-12,Monica>You could get to live out my fantasy.

65
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,160
<3-13,Ross>你对艾蜜莉有幻想
<3-13,Ross>You had fantasies about Emily?

66
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,960
<3-13,Ross>你懂得  就是那个幻想嘛
<3-13,Ross>You know, the fantasy.

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,550
<3-14,Monica>认识个异乡人  疯狂坠入爱河  然后共度一生
<3-14,Monica>Meet someone from a foreigner land, fall madly in love and spend your lives together.

68
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,220
<3-15,Ross>所以你上学的时候  老跟那个乌克兰男生鬼混
<3-15,Ross>Is that why you junior high, you hung out with that Ukrainian kid?

69
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,780
<3-16,Monica>还有  他妈妈煮什么菜都要加酸奶油
<3-16,Monica>Yeah, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.

70
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,360
<3-18,Monica>你爱她吗
<3-18,Monica>Do you love her?

71
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,860
<3-19,Ross>我们说好只在一起二个星期
<3-19,Ross>We said it would only be two weeks you know.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,490
<3-20,Monica>可你爱她
<3-20,Monica>You love her.

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,990
<3-21,Ross>说真的  什么是爱
<3-21,Ross>What is love, really?

74
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,000
<3-22,Monica>我就知道你爱她
<3-22,Monica>I knew you loved her!

75
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,360
<3-22,Monica>你得去机场告诉她
<3-22,Monica>You go to the airport and tell her.

76
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,480
<3-22,Monica>你应该能在登机门前追上她
<3-22,Monica>You'll probably catch her just when she's front go to the gate.

77
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,540
<3-22,Monica>你呼喊她的名字  并大喊"我爱你"
<3-22,Monica>You'll call her name and yell "I love you! "

78
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,000
<3-22,Monica>然后她会说"我也爱你"
<3-22,Monica>She'll say "I love you too! "

79
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,100
<3-22,Monica>然后你们会有最深情的一吻
<3-22,Monica>Then you will have the most amazing kiss.

80
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,240
<3-22,Monica>登机门前掌声如雷
<3-22,Monica>Everyone at the gate will applaud.

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,220
<3-23,Ross>我可是接吻高手哦
<3-23,Ross>I am a good kisser.

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,520
<3-24,Monica>然后你们可以溜进驾驶舱
<3-24,Monica>Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.

83
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,690
<3-24,Monica>气氛开始变得火热
<3-24,Monica>Things will start to heat up.

84
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,570
<3-24,Monica>然后一个空姐进来...
<3-24,Monica>And then a stewardess comes in...

85
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,540
<3-24,Monica>我最近A片看多了
<3-24,Monica>I've been watching too much porn.

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,700
<4-1,Rachel>-那是心跳吗  -没错
<4-1,Rachel>- Is that the heartbeat? - That's it.

88
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,680
<4-3,Phoebe>哦  天呐
<4-3,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

89
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,250
<4-4,Rachel>太酷了
<4-4,Rachel>This is so cool!

90
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,730
<4-5,The Doctor>我们谈过多胞胎的可能性吗
<4-5,The Doctor>Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,420
<4-6,Phoebe>先搞定这一胎再说吧
<4-6,Phoebe>Let's take care of this one.

92
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,470
<4-6,Phoebe>要是再怀孕  我有你的名片
<4-6,Phoebe>If I get pregnant again, I have your card.

93
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,680
<4-7,The Doctor>不是  我听到三个相互独立的心跳音
<4-7,The Doctor>No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.

94
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,130
<4-8,Phoebe>三个  不是说我连一胎都怀不上吗
<4-8,Phoebe>Three. You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one.

95
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,000
<4-9,The Doctor>医生经常犯错的
<4-9,The Doctor>Doctors are wrong all the time

96
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,460
<4-10,Phoebe>你确定有三个
<4-10,Phoebe>Are you sure that there are three?

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,010
<4-12,The Doctor>-绝对没错  -天呐  天呐  -天呐
<4-12,The Doctor>- Definitely. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,290
<4-13,Phoebe>再过几个月  我的体内
<4-13,Phoebe>So in a few months, I'll have

99
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,510
<4-13,Phoebe>是不是会有三个宝宝逛大街
<4-13,Phoebe>three babies walking around inside me?

100
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,110
<4-13,Phoebe>然后会像激流涌进的木船一样冲出来
<4-13,Phoebe>It'll be like one of those log rides when they come shooting out.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,910
<4-14,The Doctor>其实生三个跟生一个一样
<4-14,The Doctor>Giving birth to three is not that different from giving birth to one.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,200
<4-15,Phoebe>你懂什么
<4-15,Phoebe>What do you know?

103
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,880
<5-2,Phoebe>产检结果怎样
<5-2,Phoebe>How'd it go at the doctor's?

104
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,170
<5-3,Alice>你知道的啦  当你走在街上
<5-3,Alice>You know how, when you're walking down the street. . .

105
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,060
<5-4,Phoebe>看到三个人走成一列
<5-4,Phoebe>and you see three people in a row.

106
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,920
<5-4,Phoebe>你肯定会说"哦  真好"
<5-4,Phoebe>And you say "Oh, that's nice. "

107
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,880
<5-5,Frank>-懂了  -懂了就好
<5-5,Frank>-Yes. - Ok.

108
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,150
<5-6,Phoebe>好消息  你将有三个宝宝
<5-6,Phoebe>Good news! You'll have three babies.

109
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,360
<5-7,Alice>三个宝宝
<5-7,Alice>Three babies?

110
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,540
<5-8,Frank>我总算可以组乐团了
<5-8,Frank>I've finally got my band!

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,170
<5-9,Alice>我们会是个大家庭  我一直想要大家庭
<5-9,Alice>We'll have a big family! I always wanted a big family.

<5-10,Phoebe>哦  老天  你们高兴就好
<5-10,Phoebe>Oh, God, I'm so glad you're happy!

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,030
<5-11,Frank>我还怕你们会抓狂呢
<5-11,Frank>I was afraid you'd be freaked.

114
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,830
<5-11,Frank>为什么要抓狂
<5-11,Frank>Why would we be freaked?

115
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,360
<5-12,Phoebe>因为三个养起来更累  也更花钱
<5-12,Phoebe>Because it's harder to raise them and the added expense.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
<5-14,Alice>也对
<5-14,Alice>That's right.

117
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,200
<5-15,Phoebe>不  高兴些呀  高兴些呀
<5-15,Phoebe>No, back to happy. Back to happy!

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,790
<5-16,Alice>没没没  没问题的...
<5-16,Alice>No, No, No. It's going to be fine. . .

119
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,200
<5-16,Alice>因为我教家政
<5-16,Alice>because I teach home ec.

120
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,670
<5-16,Alice>所以  我可以让30个学生
<5-16,Alice>I can have 30 kids

121
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,910
<5-16,Alice>一整年都做婴儿服
<5-16,Alice>making baby clothes all year long.

122
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,450
<5-16,Alice>就像我专属的廉价童装厂
<5-16,Alice>It'll be like my very own little sweatshop.

123
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,190
<5-17,Frank>自从你说是三胞胎  我就在想
<5-17,Frank>I was thinking, ever since you said we'd have triplets.

124
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,770
<5-17,Frank>我最好休学去找一份工作
<5-17,Frank>The best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job.

125
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,130
<5-19,Phoebe>-不  法兰克  -你不能放弃学业
<5-19,Phoebe>- No, Frank. - No! You can't quit college.

126
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,670
<5-19,Phoebe>你在念书
<5-19,Phoebe>You're in college?

127
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,610
<5-20,Frank>冷冻库专校
<5-20,Frank>Refrigerator college.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,790
<5-21,Alice>当我们发现你有了孩子...
<5-21,Alice>When we found out we were having a baby...

129
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,160
<5-22,Frank>我就在想  我应该有份事业
<5-22,Frank>I figured I should have a career, you know?

130
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,140
<5-22,Frank>而且我也很喜欢冷冻库
<5-22,Frank>And I love refrigerators.

131
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,720
<5-23,Phoebe>你不能放弃你的梦想

184
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,740
<7-25,Joey>你得欲擒故纵
<7-25,Joey>You play hard-to-get.

185
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,500
<7-26,Ross>她住在伦敦
<7-26,Ross>She already lives in London.

186
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,590
<7-27,Joey>那你就去东京

187
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,280
<7-28,Chandler>算了
<7-28,Chandler>Forget it. Forget it.

188
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,330
<7-28,Chandler>你说了"我爱你"  这事完了
<7-28,Chandler>You told her you love her. It's over.

189
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,180
<7-29,Monica>谁说的  你们才完了呐
<7-29,Monica>It is not over! You're over!

190
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,520
<7-30,Chandler>什么
<7-30,Chandler>What?

191
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,440
<7-31,Monica>你自己明白
<7-31,Monica>You know.

192
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,640
<7-32,Chandler>好吧  说得好
<7-32,Chandler>Ok. Good one.

193
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,320
<7-33,Monica>事情还没完  她会打电话来  说她爱你
<7-33,Monica>It's not over. She'll call and tell you she loves you.

194
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,770
<7-33,Monica>她先前不说  是因为
<7-33,Monica>And the reason why she couldn't, is because

195
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,060
<7-33,Monica>她的感觉强烈到令她害怕
<7-33,Monica>her feelings were so strong, it scared her.

196
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,870
<7-33,Monica>快回去等电话  她可能会从飞机上打
<7-33,Monica>Go home and wait for her call. She could call from the plane.

197
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,360
<7-34,Ross>要是她没打来  那就是完了
<7-34,Ross>But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over!

198
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:58,150
<7-34,Ross>不对  如果最后我打给她  问她发生了什么
<7-34,Ross>Unless, eventually, I call her to see what's going on...

199
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,550
<7-34,Ross>然后她说  她会再打给我  结果没打
<7-34,Ross>and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't.

200
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,190
<7-34,Ross>那才是真的完了
<7-34,Ross>Then it's over!

201
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,940
<7-35,Joey>真够坚强的  汉子

203
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,570
<8-2,Chandler>我们需要休息一下
<8-2,Chandler>We need a porn break.

<8-2,Chandler>我们看了两小时的"杀进杀出又杀进"了
<8-2,Chandler>We spent two hours watching In and Out and In Again.

205
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
<8-3,Rachel>关掉不就得了
<8-3,Rachel>Why don't you turn it off?

206
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,060
<8-4,Chandler>那我们会变成关掉免费A片的白痴
<8-4,Chandler>Then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn.

207
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,910
<8-6,Monica>太好了  你们都在
<8-6,Monica>Good, you're here!

<8-9,Phoebe>This? I'm glad you asked.

210
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,150
<8-9,Phoebe>你不是讨厌用普通刀子切易拉罐吗
<8-9,Phoebe>Don't you hate to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?

211
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,400
<8-9,Phoebe>我知道你们在想什么

<8-11,Monica>- Did they make you pay for those knives? - No.

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,560
<8-13,Monica>-你确定  -我确定
<8-13,Monica>- Are you sure? - No.

215
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,530
<8-14,Phoebe>卖刀赚不了多少钱帮弗兰克的
<8-14,Phoebe>You won't make enough money that can help Frank out just by selling knives.

216
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,910
<8-16,Phoebe>可是我需要后续计划的本钱
<8-16,Phoebe>I know that. I just need enough money for the second part of my plan.

217
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,140
<8-17,Chandler>后续计划是什么
<8-17,Chandler>What's the second part of your plan?

219
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,470
<9-3,Ross>旅途还顺利吗
<9-3,Ross>How was your flight?

220
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,310
<9-4,Emily>很糟糕
<9-4,Emily>It was dreadful.

221
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,200
<9-4,Emily>你对我深情告白  我却反应那么差劲
<9-4,Emily>It was terrible how I acted when you said those wonderful things.

222
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,680
<9-4,Emily>没关系
<9-4,Emily>No, that's all right.

223
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,950
<9-5,Ross>我很高兴你打来
<9-5,Ross>I'm just glad you called.

224
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,880
<9-6,Emily>罗斯  我有事要告诉你
<9-6,Emily>Ross, there's something that I've got to tell you.

225
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,240
<9-6,Emily>我有男朋友的
<9-6,Emily>There's someone else.

226
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,200
<9-7,Ross>这句话在英国的意思  跟在美国一样吗
<9-7,Ross>Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?

227
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,580
<10-1,Ross>她不知道她想要谁  我还是那个叫柯林的
<10-1,Ross>She doesn't know who she wants. Me or this "Colin" guy.

228
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,320
<10-2,Monica>本来就应该这样  第三者休想插足
<10-2,Monica>This isn't how it's supposed to go. There can't be another guy.

229
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,430
<10-4,Monica>对了  当然得有第三者啦
<10-4,Monica>Of course, there's another guy!

230
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,160
<10-4,Monica>这样更完美
<10-4,Monica>This is even more perfect.

231
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,680
<10-4,Monica>现在你得证明你的爱
<10-4,Monica>You have to prove your love!

232
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,780
<10-5,Ross>我什么也不证明  我再也不会听你的了
<10-5,Ross>I'm not proving anything. I'm done listening to you.

233
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,150
<10-5,Ross>要不是被你说服跑去机场
<10-5,Ross>If I hadn't let you talk me into the airport in the first place,

234
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,420
<10-6,Chandler>我也不会搞到去捶墙
<10-6,Chandler>I wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.

235
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,920
<10-6,Chandler>你捶墙了
<10-6,Chandler>You put your fist through the wall?

236
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,730
<10-7,Ross>没锤着墙  锤着门了
<10-7,Ross>I missed and hit the door.

237
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,050
<10-7,Ross>不过门弹得很有力
<10-7,Ross>But it opened really hard.

238
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,600
<10-10,Monica>你得去伦敦  你得为了她去一趟伦敦
<10-10,Monica>You have to go to London. You have to go fight for her.

239
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,940
<10-11,Joey>有道理
<10-11,Joey>That makes sense.

240
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,700
<10-11,Joey>你说你爱她  她没有回应
<10-11,Joey>You already said you loved her, and she didn't say it back.

241
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,720
<10-11,Joey>然后她打电话来  说他有男朋友
<10-11,Joey>Then she told you about another guy.

242
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,750
<10-11,Joey>去伦敦吧  她会被你吓死的
<10-11,Joey>Go to London. Scare her!

243
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,910
<10-12,Monica>瑞秋跟保罗在一起时  你都做了什么
<10-12,Monica>When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do?

244
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,670
<10-13,Ross>我嘲笑他的口音
<10-13,Ross>I made fun of his accent.

245
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,280
<10-14,Monica>你让他轻松得手  你完全没争取  没错吧
<10-14,Monica>You sat back and let him have her. You didn't fight. Right?

246
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,450
<10-14,Monica>-你想让艾蜜莉也被抢走 -不想
<10-14,Monica>- You want the same thing that to happen with Emily? - No.

247
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,760
<10-16,Monica>好  那就去争取她
<10-16,Monica>All right then, go fight for her!

249
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,280
<10-16,Monica>你和艾蜜莉也可以那样
<10-16,Monica>That could be you and Emily.

250
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,800
<10-16,Monica>比他们要唯美些
<10-16,Monica>That but nicer.

251
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,460
<10-16,Monica>去伦敦吧
<10-16,Monica>Just go to London!

252
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:30,610
<10-17,Ross>当真要去

253
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,420
<10-18,Monica>快点  给她个惊喜
<10-18,Monica>Come on. Surprise her.

254
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,360
<10-18,Monica>别把她拱手让人
<10-18,Monica>Don't let her go without a fight.

255
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,530
<10-19,Ross>好吧  好吧  就这么决定了
<10-19,Ross>All right. All right. I'm going to do it.

256
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,170
<10-21,Ross>我要去伦敦争取她
<10-21,Ross>I'm going to London, and I'll fight for her.

257
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,660
<10-22,Monica>好  加油
<10-22,Monica>Okay. Good luck!

258
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,420
<10-23,Joey>罗斯  你到了机场能不能帮我买
<10-23,Joey>Ross if you get to the airport can you pick me up

259
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,880
<10-23,Joey>特大三角巧克力
<10-23,Joey>one of those Toblerone bars

260
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,370
<11-2,Phoebe>我想到了  我想到赚钱的路子了
<11-2,Phoebe>I did it! I figured out a way to make money.

261
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,810
<11-2,Phoebe>我要开按摩院  法兰克会来帮我
<11-2,Phoebe>I'll open a massage place. Frank will help me.

262
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,860
<11-2,Phoebe>按他课程表营业  他就不用退学了
<11-2,Phoebe>We'll work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.

263
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,540
<11-3,Monica>听起来很好  但你的本钱从哪里来呢
<11-3,Monica>That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?

264
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,950
<11-4,Rachel>我们走在街上  看见那辆
<11-4,Rachel>We were walking down the street,

265
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,210
<11-4,Rachel>你们用来办外烩的货车
<11-4,Rachel>and we saw your van.

266
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,700
<11-5,Phoebe>-于是我们就想到  -我来说  我来说
<11-5,Phoebe>- And we realized-- - I'm telling it! I'm telling it!

267
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,050
<11-6,Rachel>人们通勤的时候  也需要按摩放松
<11-6,Rachel>People need transportation, and they need massages to relax.

268
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,250
<11-7,Phoebe>我们可以把两者结合起来
<11-7,Phoebe>We can combine the two.

269
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,010
<11-7,Phoebe>我按摩  法兰克开车
<11-7,Phoebe>I give massages and Frank drives.

270
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,580
<11-7,Phoebe>我可以在货车里装个桌子
<11-7,Phoebe>I'll bolt a table in the van,

271
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,890
<11-7,Phoebe>你们明白了没
<11-7,Phoebe>and you know what I've got?

272
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,650
<11-8,Chandler>有进无出的死亡货车
<11-8,Chandler>A place that no one will get out of alive?

273
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,450
<11-9,Phoebe>不是  你们想啊  其实就是
<11-9,Phoebe>No. Think about it. It's a taxi that

274
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,530
<11-9,Phoebe>给想放松的人搭的计程车
<11-9,Phoebe>people take when they need to relax.

275
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,910
<11-10,Rachel>叫"轻松任你行"
<11-10,Rachel>It's a Relaxi-Taxi!

276
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,240
<11-11,Phoebe>我最想讲的就是名字
<11-11,Phoebe>The name was my favorite part!

277
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,240
<11-12,Rachel>名字是我想出来的
<11-12,Rachel>I came up with it.

278
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,560
<11-13,Phoebe>你乱讲
<11-13,Phoebe>You did not!

279
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,830
<11-13,Phoebe>你想的"轻松之行"  一点也不好
<11-13,Phoebe>You came up with Relaxi-Cab. That's not good.

280
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,380
<11-13,Phoebe>天呐  你在英国啦  艾蜜莉惊喜不
<11-13,Phoebe>Oh, my god! Ross are you in England? Was Emily surprised?

281
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,340
<12-1,Ross>没有  因为她还没回家
<12-1,Ross>No, she hasn't come home yet.

282
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,500
<12-1,Ross>她整晚都没回家  显然是跟那个人在一起
<12-1,Ross>She hasn't been home all night. She must be with the other guy.

283
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,060
<12-1,Ross>我就是个蹲在这里守夜的白痴
<12-1,Ross>I'm the stupid moron who spent the night here.

284
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,610
<12-2,Monica>下一班飞机是几点
<12-2,Monica>When is the next flight out?

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,830
<12-3,Ross>大约4小时后
<12-3,Ross>About four hours.

286
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,980
<12-4,Monica>再等一下  如果她还不出现  再回来
<12-4,Monica>Stay there for a couple of hours. If she doesn't show up, come home.

287
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,140
<12-5,Phoebe>告诉他"轻松任你行"的事
<12-5,Phoebe>Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

288
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,090
<12-5,Phoebe>问他是不是比"轻松之行"好
<12-5,Phoebe>Ask him if he likes it better than Relaxi-Cab.

289
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,620
<12-6,Rachel>不是"轻松之行"  是"轻松车行"
<12-6,Rachel>It's not Relaxi-Cab. It's Relaxi-Cab.

290
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,940
<12-6,Rachel>就像"计程车行"一样
<12-6,Rachel>Like Taxi-Cab.

291
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,400
<12-7,Phoebe>哦  这个更好

<13-2,Monica>Why are you doing here? You can't be here.

00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,740
<13-3,Emily>我有话要对罗斯说
<13-3,Emily>I've come to talk to Ross.
