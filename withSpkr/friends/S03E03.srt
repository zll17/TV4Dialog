00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,250
<2-4,Rachel>我根本不知道码头在哪
<2-4,Rachel>I didn't know there were docks.

<2-9,Rachel>你有没有告诉医生  你是因为跳上床才受伤
<2-9,Rachel>Did You tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?

<2-11,Chandler>抱歉  我想医生不会相信
<2-11,Chandler>Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,270

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,810
<3-8,Guy>太好了  我跟错人了

53
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,320
<3-8,Guy>我真是个糊涂蛋
<3-8,Guy>I am such a dingus!

<3-9,Phoebe>你不是糊涂蛋
<3-9,Phoebe>Oh, you're not a dingus.

55

<3-10,Guy>我只想让你知道  我以前不是这样的
<3-10,Guy>I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this.

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,260
<3-10,Guy>在认识你姐姐之前
<3-10,Guy>Before I met your sister,

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,280
<3-10,Guy>我只是个贩卖寻呼机和手机的普通人
<3-10,Guy>I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,650
<3-11,Phoebe>这不是你的错
<3-11,Phoebe>Look,it's not your fault. You know I mean...

<3-12,Guy>谢谢你
<3-12,Guy>Well,thanks.

61
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,980
<3-13,Phoebe>等等  我有个小故事告诉你
<3-13,Phoebe>Wait. You know what, I got a little story.

62
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,900
<3-13,Phoebe>我上初中的时候  有一段时间
<3-13,Phoebe>When I was in Junior high school, I went through a period

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,780
<3-13,Phoebe>总以为自己是女巫
<3-13,Phoebe>where I thought I was a witch.

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,720
<3-13,Phoebe>那时有个辅导老师对我说的话
<3-13,Phoebe>And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
<3-13,Phoebe>我想可以帮助你
<3-13,Phoebe>that I think will help you a lot.

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,970
<3-13,Phoebe>他说  "你根本不是女巫
<3-13,Phoebe>He said,"Okay,you're not a witch.

67
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,390
<3-13,Phoebe>你只是个普通学生"
<3-13,Phoebe>You're just an average student."

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,240
<3-14,Guy>-你听懂我的意思了吗  -不太懂
<3-14,Guy>-See what I'm saying? -Not really.

<3-15,Phoebe>I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know.

71
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,450
<3-15,Phoebe>别对自己太苛刻  好吗
<3-15,Phoebe>Don't be so hard on yourself,okay?

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,820
<4-8,Ross>整个房子里都没人
<4-8,Ross>It's an empty apartment.

84
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,670
<4-9,Rachel>这间空房子里  只有我们两个
<4-9,Rachel>We're all alone in an empty apartment.

85
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,450
<4-11,Rachel>宝贝  拜托
<4-11,Rachel>Honey, come on.

86
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,870
<4-11,Rachel>我在十分钟内得出发去上班
<4-11,Rachel>I have to be at work like in 10 minutes.

87
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,610
<4-11,Rachel>好吧  我又不是什么年度模范员工
<4-11,Rachel>All right. Alright, it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.

88
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,230
<4-12,Ross>在这里啊
<4-12,Ross>There it is!

89
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,470
<4-13,Rachel>这就是你要找的啊
<4-13,Rachel>Oh,that's what you are talking about.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,210
<4-14,Ross>我看起来很胖吗
<4-14,Ross>Do I look fat?

91
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,060
<4-16,Ross and Rachel>-不胖  -不胖
<4-16,Ross and Rachel>- No. - No.

92
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,110
<4-17,Chandler>这么说我完全可以接受
<4-17,Chandler>Okay, I accept that.

93
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,020
<4-17,Chandler>当珍妮斯问我时  我也说了不
<4-17,Chandler>When Janice asked me and I said no,

94
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,890
<4-17,Chandler>她却理解为  我觉得她像只母牛
<4-17,Chandler>she took that as I was calling her a cow.

95
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,870
<4-18,Rachel>好吧  情景重现一下  重现一下
<4-18,Rachel>Okay, walk us through it,honey. Walk us through it.

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,040
<4-19,Chandler>珍妮斯问  "我今天看起来胖吗"
<4-19,Chandler>Okay, well, Janice said,"Hi. Do I look fat today?"

97
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,410
<4-19,Chandler>于是我就看了看她
<4-19,Chandler>And I looked at her...

98
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,480
<4-19,Chandler>等等  你看了看她
<4-19,Chandler>Wow, wow, wow, you looked at her?

99
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,090
<4-20,Ross>你决不能迟疑
<4-20,Ross>You never look.

100
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,080
<4-20,Ross>你只能直接回答  就像条件反射一样
<4-20,Ross>You just answer. It's like a reflex.

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,020
<4-20,Ross>"我看起来胖吗"  "不"
<4-20,Ross>"Do I look fat?" "No."

102
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,350
<4-20,Ross>"她比我漂亮吗"  "不"
<4-20,Ross>"Is she prettier than I am?" "No."

103
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,970
<4-20,Ross>"尺寸很重要吗"  "不"
<4-20,Ross>"Does size matter?" "No."

104
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,900
<4-22,Ross>这一条男女都适用
<4-22,Ross>And it works both ways.

105
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,060
<4-23,Chandler>这些你们天生就知道吗
<4-23,Chandler>So you both just know this stuff?

106
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,130
<4-24,Rachel>吵了大概三四十次后  你大概就领悟了
<4-24,Rachel>You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,you kind of catch on.

107
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,650
<4-25,Ross>是啊  例如
<4-25,Ross>Okay. For instance:

108
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,480
<4-25,Ross>假如珍妮斯旅行回来
<4-25,Ross>Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip.

109
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,540
<4-25,Ross>她给你两种选择
<4-25,Ross>She gives you two options.

110
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,600
<4-25,Ross>选择一  她从机场自己打车回来
<4-25,Ross>Option one: She'll take a cab home from the airport.

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,780
<4-25,Ross>选择二  你在领行李的地方与她碰面
<4-25,Ross>Or Option two: You can meet her at baggage claim.

112
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,750
<4-25,Ross>你会怎么做
<4-25,Ross>What do you do?

113
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,990
<4-26,Chandler>简单  领行李的地方
<4-26,Chandler>That's easy. Baggage claim.

114
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,090
<4-27,Ross>错  这下你就变单身了
<4-27,Ross>And wrong! Now you're single.

115
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,790
<4-27,Ross>其实是第三个秘密绝招
<4-27,Ross>It's actually secret option number three.

116
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,650
<4-27,Ross>你要在出舱口等她  这样她才知道你爱她
<4-27,Ross>You meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.

117
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,740
<4-28,Chandler>好  这么说有道理  有道理
<4-28,Chandler>Okay,this is good. This is good.

118
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,480
<4-28,Chandler>好  我还有一个问题
<4-28,Chandler>All right, I have one.

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,840
<4-28,Chandler>珍妮斯晚上喜欢拥抱
<4-28,Chandler>Janice likes to cuddle...

120
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,430
<4-28,Chandler>我当然也喜欢拥抱
<4-28,Chandler>at night, which I'm all for.

121
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,660
<4-28,Chandler>不过到睡觉的时候
<4-28,Chandler>But you know, when you want to go to sleep,

122
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,340
<4-28,Chandler>你会想要一点自己的空间
<4-28,Chandler>you want some space.

123
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,120
<4-28,Chandler>我要怎样告诉她才不至于...
<4-28,Chandler>So how do I tell her that without...

124
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,360
<4-28,Chandler>让诸如不小心说她胖之类的意外发生
<4-28,Chandler>...you know,accidentally calling her fat or something?

125
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,240
<4-29,Rachel>抱歉  这我们帮不了你
<4-29,Rachel>Oh, honey. I'm sorry we can't help you there,

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,850
<4-29,Rachel>因为我们都是抱着睡的
<4-29,Rachel>because we're cuddly sleepers.

127
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,380
<4-29,Rachel>好了  我上班要迟到了
<4-29,Rachel>Okay, I'm late for work.

128
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,210
<4-31,Rachel>-你们要不要下来  -好  等一下就去
<4-31,Rachel>- Are you guys gonna come down? - Yeah, yeah. I, I'm right behind you.

129
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,510
<4-33,Rachel>祝你好运  钱德勒
<4-33,Rachel>Okay, Good luck, Chandler.

130
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,760
<4-34,Chandler>谢谢你  瑞秋  拜
<4-34,Chandler>Thank you, Rachel. Bye.

131

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,790
<4-36,Rachel>好了  睡觉那个问题
<4-36,Rachel>Okay, the sleeping thing.

133
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,060
<4-37,Ross>很不容易解决  但也不是没办法
<4-37,Ross>Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.

134
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,660
<4-38,Chandler>我还以为你们都是"抱着睡的"
<4-38,Chandler>I thought you guys were "cuddly sleepers."

135
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,960
<4-38,Chandler>不是
<4-38,Chandler>No.

136
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,640
<4-39,Ross>不  不是抱着睡的  不是我  只有她
<4-39,Ross>No, not cuddly. Not me. Just her.

137
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,740
<4-39,Ross>我跟你一样  需要空间
<4-39,Ross>I'm like you. I need the room.

138
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,720
<4-39,Ross>好  到这儿来
<4-39,Ross>Okay, come here.

139
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,380
<4-39,Ross>-好  假设你现在在床上  -好
<4-39,Ross>- Okay. You're in bed. - Yeah.

140
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,410
<4-41,Ross>-我还是用垫子好了  -好的
<4-41,Ross>- I gonna use the cushion. - Yeah.

141
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,820
<4-39,Ross>好了  假设你在床上
<4-39,Ross>Okay. You're in bed.

142
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,660
<4-43,Ross>她在你旁边  抱着你
<4-43,Ross>She's over on your side,cuddling.

143
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,730
<4-43,Ross>现在  你等她逐渐睡着
<4-43,Ross>Now,you wait for her to drift off...

144
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,490
<4-43,Ross>然后你抱住她...
<4-43,Ross>...and then you hug her...

145
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,410
<4-43,Ross>把她滚到床的另一边
<4-43,Ross>...and roll her over to her side of the bed.

146
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,460
<4-43,Ross>接着你...
<4-43,Ross>And then you...

147
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,360
<4-44,Chandler>再滚到旁边去
<4-44,Chandler>... roll away.

148
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,220
<4-43,Ross>拥抱是为了她
<4-43,Ross>Hug for her.

149
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,000
<4-43,Ross>滚走是为了自己
<4-43,Ross>Roll for you.

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,380
<4-44,Chandler>-这就是经典的"拥抱与翻滚"  -没错
<4-44,Chandler>- Okay, the old "hug and roll." - Yeah.

151
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,360
<4-46,Chandler>-还有一个问题 -说吧
<4-46,Chandler>- One question. - Sure.

152
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,420
<4-46,Chandler>你刚才是把枕头当作女生  对吧
<4-46,Chandler>You're pretending the pillow's a girl,right?

153
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,630
<5-1,Joey>记得小时候
<5-1,Joey>Remember when you were a kid,

154
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,400
<5-1,Joey>妈妈会把你送到电影院...
<5-1,Joey>your mom would drop you off to the movies...

155
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,530
<5-1,Joey>给你一罐果酱和一只小汤匙
<5-1,Joey>...with a jar of jam and a little spoon?

156
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,410
<5-2,Rachel>你真可爱
<5-2,Rachel>You're so pretty.

157
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,740
<5-3,Phoebe>-嗨  -嗨  菲比
<5-3,Phoebe>-Hi.  -Hi, Phoebe.

158
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,250
<5-4,All>你知道那个跟踪我的人吗
<5-4,All>Hey, you know that guy who's been following me?

159
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,630
<5-5,Phoebe>我今天跟他说话了
<5-5,Phoebe>I talked to him today.

160
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,200
<5-6,Joey>你跟他说话  你疯了吗
<5-6,Joey>You talked to him? Are you crazy?

161
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,640
<5-7,Phoebe>第一  我没有疯  第二  说话别乱喷
<5-7,Phoebe>Okay, first,I'm not crazy. And second,say it, don't spray it.

162
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,860
<5-7,Phoebe>总之他名叫麦尔科姆  他也不是在跟踪我
<5-7,Phoebe>Anyway, his name is Malcolm, and he wasn't following me.

163
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,720
<5-7,Phoebe>我是说  他在跟踪没错
<5-7,Phoebe>I mean, he was,

164
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,010
<5-7,Phoebe>但他要跟的是厄休拉
<5-7,Phoebe>but just 'cause he thought I was Ursula.

165
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,340
<5-7,Phoebe>所以他不敢上前来跟我说话
<5-7,Phoebe>That's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.

166
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,770
<5-7,Phoebe>因为有限制令嘛
<5-7,Phoebe>Because of the restraining order.

167
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,850
<5-8,Chandler>我还是对麦尔科姆没有好感
<5-8,Chandler>Not feeling better about Malcolm.

168
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,470
<5-9,Phoebe>不  他不是疯子
<5-9,Phoebe>No, no, he's not a kook.

169
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,920
<5-9,Phoebe>他只是个非常热情  极度浪漫的家伙
<5-9,Phoebe>He's just this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy...

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,890
<5-9,Phoebe>只是表现得有点过火了而已
<5-9,Phoebe>...that just got a teensy bit carried away, you know.

171
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,010
<5-9,Phoebe>我们相处得很好  而且他很可爱
<5-9,Phoebe>We just get along really well, and he's so cute.

172
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,830
<5-10,Ross>天啊  你竟然暗恋跟踪你妹妹的人
<5-10,Ross>Oh, my God! You've got a crush on your sister's stalker.

173
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,330
<5-11,Phoebe>我要帮他忘记厄休拉的一切
<5-11,Phoebe>No, just gonna help him, you know, get "de-Ursula-ized."

174
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,810
<5-11,Phoebe>就像乔伊跟她分手后  我陪他疗伤一样
<5-11,Phoebe>Like, you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.

175
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,850
<5-12,Joey>可我没有跟踪她
<5-12,Joey>I didn't stalk her, I mean.

176
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,450
<5-13,Phoebe>这不是重点好么
<5-13,Phoebe>I asked for the news, not the weather.

177
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,100
<5-15,All>-嗨  大伙儿  -嗨  莫妮卡
<5-15,All>-Hi, guys. - Hi, Mon.

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,980
<5-16,Monica>乔伊  这是你的  黑莓红醋粟酱
<5-16,Monica>Joey,this is for you. It's blackberry currant.

179
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,080
<5-17,Joey>乔伊  我得问你
<5-17,Joey>Okay, Joe, I got to ask.

180
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,240
<5-18,Chandler>影印店的那个女孩  全裸
<5-18,Chandler>The girl from the xerox place, buck naked...

181
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,270
<5-18,Chandler>一大缸果酱  你选哪个
<5-18,Chandler>...or a big tub of jam?

182
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,000
<5-19,Joey>左右手通吃
<5-19,Joey>Put your hands together.

183
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,150
<5-20,Monica>乔伊  你慢慢享用吧  那是最后一瓶了
<5-20,Monica>Joey, take your time with that. It's my last batch.

184
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,620
<5-21,Joey>没有果酱了
<5-21,Joey>No more jam?

185
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,860
<5-22,Rachel>你的果酱大计怎么不继续了
<5-22,Rachel>What happened to your jam plan?

186
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,680
<5-23,Monica>我算过了  我每罐得卖17元才能收回成本
<5-23,Monica>I figured out I'd need to charge $17 a jar just to break even.

187
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,310
<5-23,Monica>所以我有了个新计划  生小孩
<5-23,Monica>So I've got a new plan now. Babies.

188
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,640
<5-24,Chandler>那你可能需要更大的罐子了
<5-24,Chandler>Well,you're gonna need much bigger jars.

189
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,700
<5-26,Monica>-你胡说什么呢  -我说我打算生孩子
<5-26,Monica>- What are you talking about? - I'm talking about me having a baby.

190
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,170
<5-27,Ross>-你说真的吗  -是啊
<5-27,Ross>- What? Are you serious? - Yeah.

191
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,540
<5-29,Monica>做果酱的好处在于
<5-29,Monica>The great thing about the jam plan

192
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,820
<5-29,Monica>它让我重新掌握自己的人生
<5-29,Monica>was I was taking control of my life.

193
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,520
<5-29,Monica>所以我扪心自问
<5-29,Monica>So I ask myself,

194
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,800
<5-29,Monica>这个世界上对我来说什么是最重要的呢
<5-29,Monica>"What is the most important thing to me in the world?"

195
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,820
<5-29,Monica>于是我就想到了生孩子
<5-29,Monica>And that's when I came up with the baby plan.

196
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,030
<5-30,Ross>你是不是忘了一点
<5-30,Ross>Aren't you forgetting something?

197
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,010
<5-30,Ross>那人叫什么来着  "爸爸"
<5-30,Ross>What is that guy's name? Dad!

198
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,180
<5-31,Monica>我花了28年  去找一个能托付终身的男人
<5-31,Monica>It took me 28 years to find one man I wanted to spend my life with.

199
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,720
<5-31,Monica>如果我还得再等28年
<5-31,Monica>If I have to wait another 28 years,

200
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,490
<5-31,Monica>那我生孩子就得56岁了
<5-31,Monica>I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

201
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,560
<5-31,Monica>那样实在太愚蠢了
<5-31,Monica>And that's just stupid.

202
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
<5-32,Chandler>那才是愚蠢的点吗
<5-32,Chandler>That's what's stupid?

203
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,760
<5-33,Monica>我并不需要一个真正的男人
<5-33,Monica>I don't need an actual man.

204
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,400
<5-33,Monica>我只要他几颗会游泳的小种子
<5-33,Monica>Just a couple of his best swimmers.

205
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,270
<5-33,Monica>而且那些东西  也是有地方能买到的
<5-33,Monica>And there are places you can go to get that...stuff.

206
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,980
<5-34,Rachel>又要去码头了吗
<5-34,Rachel>Down to the docks again?

207
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,190
<6-1,Janice>晚安  宾宝贝
<6-1,Janice>Night-night,Bing-a-ling.

208
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,960
<6-1,Janice>晚安
<6-1,Janice>Night-night...

209

<6-1,Janice>珍妮斯
<6-1,Janice>...Janice.

210
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,970
<6-2,Chandler>看看她那边的位置
<6-2,Chandler>Look at all the room on her side!

211
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,690
<6-2,Chandler>都够放一只大企鹅了
<6-2,Chandler>You could fit a giant penguin over there.

212
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,880
<6-2,Chandler>不过那样会很奇怪
<6-2,Chandler>That'd be weird,though.

213
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,120
<6-2,Chandler>要开始"拥抱与翻滚"了
<6-2,Chandler>Okay, hug and roll time.

214
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,640
<6-2,Chandler>先是拥抱  抱住她
<6-2,Chandler>I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

215
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
<10-1,Malcom>翻滚起来  接着...
<10-1,Malcom>You're rolling,and....

216
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,680
<10-2,Phoebe>太好了  你自由了
<10-2,Phoebe>Yes! Freedom!

217
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,060
<6-1,Janice>除了这只手臂
<6-1,Janice>Except for this arm!

218
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,050
<6-2,Chandler>我被卡住了  手臂卡住了
<6-2,Chandler>I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

219
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,070
<6-2,Chandler>好了  我们玩过去那种掀桌布游戏
<6-2,Chandler>Okay, time for the old tablecloth trick.

220
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,980
<6-2,Chandler>只需一个流畅的动作
<6-2,Chandler>One fluid motion.

221
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,150
<6-2,Chandler>像猫一样矫捷  像猫一样矫捷
<6-2,Chandler>Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.

<7-3,Malcom>These are my night-vision goggles.

228
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,580
<7-3,Malcom>这是我在公园里看她时  假装阅读的书
<7-3,Malcom>This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park.

229
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,220
<7-3,Malcom>这些是接字游戏  只是为了解闷
<7-3,Malcom>And these are Madlibs. They're just for fun.

<7-4,Phoebe>What's this?

232
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,030
<7-5,Malcom>这是我写的日志  记录她的一举一动
<7-5,Malcom>This is the log I kept,recording her every movement.

233
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,020
<7-5,Malcom>你要不要听听看
<7-5,Malcom>Do you want to hear some from it?

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,820
<7-6,Phoebe>我一点也不想听
<7-6,Phoebe>Not even a little bit.

235
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,560
<7-7,Malcom>是跟你有关的
<7-7,Malcom>It's about you.

236
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,290
<7-8,Phoebe>那好吧
<7-8,Phoebe>Oh, okay then.

237
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,120
<7-9,Malcom>"我今天遇到菲比

238
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,860
<7-9,Malcom>她对我很好  即使我是就是个大屌丝
<7-9,Malcom>She was really nice to me even though I'm such a loser.

239
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,240
<7-9,Malcom>我走在回家路上  一直想着她
<7-9,Malcom>And when I was walking home,I thought about her a lot.

240
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,930
<7-9,Malcom>虽然很奇怪  但感觉很棒"
<7-9,Malcom>It was weird, but kind of cool."

241
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,810
<7-9,Malcom>很好
<7-9,Malcom>Good.

242
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,380
<7-10,Phoebe>当时你在想什么
<7-10,Phoebe>So what were you thinking?

243
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,250
<7-11,Malcom>我在想  亲你是什么感觉
<7-11,Malcom>I was thinking what it'd be like to kiss you.

244
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,090
<7-12,Phoebe>真的
<7-12,Phoebe>Really?

245

322
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,510
<10-6,Phoebe>我害怕你仍然迷恋我姐姐
<10-6,Phoebe>I was just afraid you were still hung up on my sister.

323
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,430
<10-7,Malcom>所以你在监视我
<10-7,Malcom>So you spied on me.

324
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,500
<10-7,Malcom>我真不敢相信你不信任我
<10-7,Malcom>I can't believe you don't trust me.

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,870
<10-8,Phoebe>真想不到  我的双胞胎姐姐正好经过

327
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,920
<10-8,Phoebe>这只是个诡异的巧合
<10-8,Phoebe>Well, is this a freakish coincidence,

328
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,280
<10-8,Phoebe>还是你早知道她会搭这班车
<10-8,Phoebe>or did you know she takes this train?

329
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,020
<10-9,Malcom>对不起  对不起

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,830
<10-9,Malcom>我真可悲
<10-9,Malcom>I'm so pathetic.

332

<10-10,Phoebe>不  不是你的错  我也有点错
<10-10,Phoebe>No, no, it's not your fault. No. It's partly my fault.

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,690
<10-10,Phoebe>是我要你决然戒除这个毛病
<10-10,Phoebe>'cause I made you quit cold turkey.

334
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,200
<10-10,Phoebe>我不能再跟你约会了  因为你...

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,160
<10-10,Phoebe>但我一定会帮你忘掉我姐姐

336
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,960
<10-10,Phoebe>试着跟踪我一阵子  如何
