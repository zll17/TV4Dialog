00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,070
<1-1,Chandler>老实说  似乎短短几个星期

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,800
<1-1,Chandler>发生了那么多

<1-5,Chandler>I mean if I die

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,060
<1-5,Chandler>我来过这里的唯一证据
<1-5,Chandler>the only way people would even know I was here,

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,320
<1-5,Chandler>就是这张椅子上的屁股印
<1-5,Chandler>would be by the ass print on this chair!

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,390
<1-5,Chandler>我们得做件大事  惊天动地的大事
<1-5,Chandler>Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,000
<1-6,Joey>我们可以去爬珠穆朗玛峰
<1-6,Joey>We could climb Mt. Everest.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,000
<1-7,Chandler>不是落人笑柄  是惊天动地
<1-7,Chandler>No-no, not something stupid, something huge.

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,400
<1-8,Joey>不  不  我看到一则录影带的广告
<1-8,Joey>No, no. I saw an ad for this video,

<1-8,Joey>每天都有人在爬  我们也可以爬
<1-8,Joey>people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,650
<1-9,Chandler>谁说不行  不过是爬山而已
<1-9,Chandler>Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing!

15
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,780
<1-9,Chandler>-不过是陡峭了点  -是啊

00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,100
<1-10,Joey>我们就去爬珠穆朗玛峰
<1-10,Joey>We're going to Everest!

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,390
<1-11,Chandler>在山顶上留屁股印一定很赞
<1-11,Chandler>Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,130
<1-14,Phoebe>你们在干嘛呢
<1-14,Phoebe>What's up?

00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,860
<1-17,Phoebe>登珠峰要花六万块  而且可能会死
<1-17,Phoebe>Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and you know you can die.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,950
<1-17,Phoebe>你俩一定会死
<1-17,Phoebe>And you would die.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,060
<1-19,Joey>我们可以去租珠穆朗玛峰的录影带
<1-19,Joey>We could get that Everest video, though.

<1-20,Chandler>那样就不必冒生命危险了
<1-20,Chandler>Yeah, we could do that without risking our lives at all.

<2-1,Emily>So what did we decide?

50
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,200
<2-1,Emily>请不请你的纳森叔叔
<2-1,Emily>Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,370
<2-1,Emily>天啊  没有人喜欢他
<2-1,Emily>Oh, God! Nobody likes him.

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,380
<2-2,Ross>他好小器  他绝不会飞去伦敦的
<2-2,Ross>He's so cheap. He'd never fly to London in a million years.

53
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,540
<2-2,Ross>好  请吧
<2-2,Ross>Invite him!

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,740
<2-2,Ross>我的字写得还可以吗
<2-2,Ross>Did I do these neat enough?

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,300
<2-3,Emily>挺不错的
<2-3,Emily>Yeah, they're fine.

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,460
<2-5,Emily>别人问起来  我们就说是本写的
<2-5,Emily>If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,320
<2-5,Emily>你还请了瑞秋
<2-5,Emily>So you invited Rachel then?

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,750
<2-6,Ross>对啊  干嘛不请

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,150
<2-7,Emily>真的吗
<2-7,Emily>Really?

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,880
<2-9,Emily>如果邀请我的旧情人  我会觉得很别扭
<2-9,Emily>I wouldn't be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.

61
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,720
<2-10,Ross>你觉得我们不该请她吗
<2-10,Ross>Wait, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?

62
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,340
<2-11,Emily>不  罗斯  我很喜欢瑞秋
<2-11,Emily>Oh, no-no, Ross, you know I absolutely adore Rachel.

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,900
<2-11,Emily>我只是...怕你会尴尬
<2-11,Emily>It's just that I thought it might be awkward for you.

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,540
<2-11,Emily>不过这完全由你来决定
<2-11,Emily>But it's absolutely your decision.

<12-2,Ross>但我不想再跟你的答录机交往了
<12-2,Ross>having a relationship with your answering machine, okay?

137
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,280
<12-2,Ross>我已经没辙了
<12-2,Ross>I don't know what to do anymore.

138
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,420
<12-3,Rachel>我也是
<12-3,Rachel>Neither do I!

139
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,040
<12-4,Ross>这跟马克有关吗
<12-4,Ross>Is this about Mark?

140
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,070
<12-5,Rachel>我的天啊
<12-5,Rachel>Oh, my God!

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,000
<12-5,Rachel>-好  看来不是  -天啊
<12-5,Rachel>- Okay, it's not. - Oh, my god!

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,020
<12-7,Rachel>我不能为了同一件事跟你一吵再吵
<12-7,Rachel>I can't keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.

143
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,580
<12-8,Ross>你快把我逼疯了
<12-8,Ross>You're making this too hard!

144
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,270
<12-8,Ross>我逼你  那你要我怎么做
<12-8,Ross>I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do?

145
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,850
<12-8,Ross>我不知道
<12-8,Ross>I don't know. I don't know.

146
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,420
<12-9,Rachel>也许我们应该分开
<12-9,Rachel>Look, maybe we should just take a break.

147
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,420
<12-10,Ross>你说得对  我们先冷静一下
<12-10,Ross>You're right. Let's take a break. Let's cool off.

148
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,800
<12-10,Ross>去吃点酸奶冰淇淋什么的
<12-10,Ross>Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.

149
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,460
<12-10,Ross>不是
<12-10,Ross>No.

150
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,410
<12-11,Rachel>我是说分手
<12-11,Rachel>A break from us.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,890
<13-1,Chloe>干嘛这么着急啊
<13-1,Chloe>Do I know why are we rushing?

152
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,320
<13-2,Ross>我昨晚提到的那个女朋友
<13-2,Ross>The girlfriend I told you about last night.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,740
<13-2,Ross>她想跟我复合
<13-2,Ross>She wants to get back together with me.

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,530
<14-5,Rachel>那么  我可以再当你的女朋友吗
<14-5,Rachel>So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?

160
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,040
<14-6,Ross>可以得不得了
<14-6,Ross>Yes, you can very much.

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,330
<15-1,Rachel>你给我走  滚  快滚
<15-1,Rachel>I want you to leave. Get out of here! Just get out!

162
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,900
<15-4,Ross>不  我想留下来谈一谈
<15-4,Ross>No, I wanna stay. I want to talk about this.

163
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,160
<15-5,Rachel>好  她怎么样
<15-5,Rachel>All right, how was she?

164
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,210
<15-5,Rachel>-什么  -她活好吗
<15-5,Rachel>- What? - Was she good?

165
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,130
<15-5,Rachel>不要回答
<15-5,Rachel>Don't answer that!

166
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
<15-5,Rachel>来嘛  罗斯  你说你想谈
<15-5,Rachel>Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it,

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,230
<15-5,Rachel>那就谈啊  她怎么样
<15-5,Rachel>let's talk about it!! How was she?

168
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,510
<15-5,Rachel>她...
<15-5,Rachel>She was...

169
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,000
<15-5,Rachel>-差劲  糟糕  -她很逊
<15-5,Rachel>- Awful! Horrible! - She was not good, not good.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,810
<15-5,Rachel>什么都比不上你
<15-5,Rachel>Nothing compared to you.

171
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,370
<15-5,Rachel>她感觉很不同
<15-5,Rachel>She was different.

172
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,210
<15-5,Rachel>比我好吗
<15-5,Rachel>Good different?

173
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,040
<15-5,Rachel>没有人喜欢改变
<15-5,Rachel>Nobody likes change.

174
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,830
<15-5,Rachel>别再说了
<15-5,Rachel>Just stop!

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,300
<15-5,Rachel>你这么坦然认错
<15-5,Rachel>The way you owned up to everything.

176
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,340
<15-5,Rachel>证明你真的成长了不少
<15-5,Rachel>It's just showed me how much you've grown, you know?

177
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,140
<15-5,Rachel>我妈一直觉得我们无法复合
<15-5,Rachel>I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.

178
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,650
<15-5,Rachel>她说  狗改不了吃屎
<15-5,Rachel>She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."

179
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,720
<24-1,Rachel>真希望没有这四个月的空白
<24-1,Rachel>I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.

180
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,640
<24-1,Rachel>但要是时间能让你认清错误
<24-1,Rachel>But if time was what you needed

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
<24-1,Rachel>那也不算浪费
<24-1,Rachel>just to gain a little perspective.

182
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,470
<24-2,Ross>我们当时分手了
<24-2,Ross>We were on a break!

184
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,820
<25-1,Rachel>你似乎真的很喜欢她
<25-1,Rachel>You seem to really like her.

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,120
<25-2,Ross>我能怎么办  我们说好只在一起两周
<25-2,Ross>What do I do? We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

186
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,510
<25-2,Ross>不做承诺
<25-2,Ross>No commitment.

187
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,900
<25-3,Rachel>罗斯  那个女孩整晚都在
<25-3,Rachel>Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,520
<25-3,Rachel>和你朋友聊天
<25-3,Rachel>talking to your friends

189
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,560
<25-3,Rachel>嚷着要听你的事
<25-3,Rachel>asking to hear stories about you

190
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,180
<25-3,Rachel>还看莫妮卡的相簿
<25-3,Rachel>looking through Monica's photo albums.

191
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,840
<25-3,Rachel>只想在一起两周才不会这样
<25-3,Rachel>You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.

192
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,840
<25-4,Ross>是吗
<25-4,Ross>You think?

193
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,160
<25-5,Rachel>她还有14个小时才去机场
<25-5,Rachel>You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.

194
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,590
<25-5,Rachel>你却坐在走廊上
<25-5,Rachel>And you're sitting here in a hallway

195
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,960
<25-5,Rachel>陪一个香肠嘴的大龄啦啦队长
<25-5,Rachel>with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

196
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,890
<25-5,Rachel>-你说得对  -是啊
<25-5,Rachel>- You're right. - Yeah.

197
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,460
<26-1,Monica>太棒了
<26-1,Monica>This is so amazing!

198
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,280
<26-1,Monica>我哥哥居然要去伦敦结婚
<26-1,Monica>Can't believe my brother's getting married and in London!

199
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,820
<26-1,Monica>好浪漫哦
<26-1,Monica>It's just so romantic.

<26-2,Joey>需要手帕吗  不了  我有喜帖
<26-2,Joey>Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.

204

<26-3,Phoebe>太可爱了
<26-3,Phoebe>Isn't this adorable?

205
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,450
<26-3,Phoebe>罗斯让本写我的喜帖
<26-3,Phoebe>Ross let Ben address mine.

206

<26-6,Monica>你收到罗斯的喜帖了吗
<26-6,Monica>Did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding?

<26-10,Phoebe>好羡慕你们都能去
<26-10,Phoebe>I'm so jealous you're all going.

211
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,410
<26-12,Monica>我都不知道
<26-12,Monica>I can't believe I never knew

212
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,370
<26-10,Phoebe>怀孕七月以上不能坐飞机
<26-10,Phoebe>you can't fly in your third trimester.

213
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,940
<26-12,Monica>我也不知道
<26-12,Monica>I didn't, either.

214
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,710
<26-13,Joey>我知道
<26-13,Joey>I knew that.

215
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,860
<26-13,Joey>其实我也不知道  但你们的表情好逗
<26-13,Joey>So I didn't know that. But you should see your faces.

216
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,010
<26-14,Rachel>你们在干嘛
<26-14,Rachel>Hey, guys. What's up?

217
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,690
<26-16,Monica>没干嘛
<26-16,Monica>Just hanging out.

218
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,770
<26-17,Rachel>这是什么  罗斯的喜帖
<26-17,Rachel>What's this? Ross' wedding invitation?

219
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,620
<26-18,Chandler>我们该藏的是那一张
<26-18,Chandler>Maybe that's the one we should have hidden.

220
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,060
<26-19,Rachel>不  伙计们  你们不必这样
<26-19,Rachel>No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that.

221
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,890
<26-19,Rachel>我很替他高兴
<26-19,Rachel>I'm happy for him.

222
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,950
<26-19,Rachel>真的  我很...
<26-19,Rachel>I am. I really...

223
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,470
<26-19,Rachel>我会调整心态的
<26-19,Rachel>I'll work on it.

224
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,170
<26-20,Monica>我很遗憾
<26-20,Monica>I'm sorry honey.

225
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
<26-22,Monica>不过你还是会去吧
<26-22,Monica>You're going to come, though, aren't you?

226
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,910
<26-23,Rachel>我不知道
<26-23,Rachel>Honey, I don't know.

227
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,490
<26-24,Chandler>该不会是她不去  我们就不去了吧
<26-24,Chandler>This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

228
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,560
<26-24,Chandler>我已经买好机票了
<26-24,Chandler>Because I've already bought my ticket.

229
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,480
<26-25,Monica>你要是不去才真的奇怪
<26-25,Monica>You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,400
<26-26,Rachel>-你就考虑一下吧  -我会考虑的
<26-26,Rachel>- Just say you'll think about it. - I'll think about it.

<27-1,Rachel>-这是谁送的  -罗斯送的
<27-1,Rachel>- Who's this from? - That's Ross'.

232
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,710
<27-2,Chandler>天啊
<27-2,Chandler>Oh, my God!

233
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,970
<27-3,Rachel>他竟然记得
<27-3,Rachel>He remembered.

234
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,100
<27-4,Phoebe>记得什么
<27-4,Phoebe>Remembered what?

235
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,240
<27-5,Rachel>好几个月前  我们经过一家古董店
<27-5,Rachel>It was months ago. We were walking by this antique store.

236
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,040
<27-5,Rachel>我看到这个别针
<27-5,Rachel>and I saw this pin in the window,

237
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,430
<27-5,Rachel>对他说我奶奶有个一模一样的
<27-5,Rachel>and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had

238
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,820
<27-5,Rachel>我小时候见过
<27-5,Rachel>when I was a little girl.

239
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,130
<27-7,Monica>他居然记得
<27-7,Monica>I can't believe he remembered!

240
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,990
<27-6,Phoebe>他一定花了很多钱
<27-6,Phoebe>This must've cost him a fortune.

241
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,440
<27-7,Monica>他居然这么大方
<27-7,Monica>I can't believe he did this.

242
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,930
<27-8,Chandler>罗斯嘛  他大学的时候
<27-8,Chandler>Come on, Ross? Remember back in college,

243
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,980
<27-8,Chandler>爱卡罗尔爱得死去活来
<27-8,Chandler>when he fell in love with Carol

244
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,520
<27-8,Chandler>就送了她一只超贵的水晶鸭
<27-8,Chandler>and got her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?

245
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,680
<27-9,Rachel>你刚才说什么
<27-9,Rachel>What did you just say?

246
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,170
<27-9,Rachel>我的天啊
<27-9,Rachel>Oh, my God!

247
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,810
<27-9,Rachel>来自北京的457号班机已经抵达
<27-9,Rachel>Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

248
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,480
<27-9,Rachel>天啊
<27-9,Rachel>Oh, my God!

249
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,510
<29-1,Julie>我们是老同学
<29-1,Julie>Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.

250
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,300
<29-2,Ross>毕业后就没见过
<29-2,Ross>But we haven't seen each other since then.

251
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,850
<29-2,Ross>到了中国  你们猜是谁主持挖掘工作
<29-2,Ross>I land in China. Guess who's in charge of the dig?

<29-3,Rachel>朱莉
<29-3,Rachel>Julie!

253
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,280
<29-3,Rachel>很棒吧

<30-4,Rachel>显然  我已经不在乎你了
<30-4,Rachel>Obviously, I am over you.

269
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,180
<30-4,Rachel>我已经不在乎你了
<30-4,Rachel>I am over you.

270
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,160
<30-4,Rachel>而这  就是传说中的一刀两断
<30-4,Rachel>And that, my friend, is what they call closure.

271
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,270
<31-1,Ross>瑞秋  我收到条你发的留言

301
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,750
<36-2,Rachel>因为我生你的气  不是因为我不爱你了
<36-2,Rachel>Yeah, because I was mad at you. Not because I stopped loving you.

302
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,360
<36-3,Ross>-你还爱我吗  -不爱
<36-3,Ross>- You still love me? - No.

<36-3,Ross>我居然会想跟你复合
<36-3,Ross>I can't believe I even thought of getting back together with you.

308
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,430
<38-1,Rachel>我们彻底完了
<38-1,Rachel>We're so over!

<38-2,Ross>无所谓
<38-2,Ross>Fine by me!

310
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,800
<38-2,Ross>顺便告诉你  别以为这种事很常见
<38-2,Ross>And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common.

311
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,360
<38-2,Ross>不是每个男人都能找到我这样的女朋友
<38-2,Ross>It doesn't happen to every guy,

312
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,940
<39-1,Rachel>你损失大了
<39-1,Rachel>and it is a big deal.

323
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,650
<40-8,Monica>闭嘴  上镜头会多10磅
<40-8,Monica>Shut up! The camera adds 10 pounds.

324
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,060
<40-9,Chandler>那到底是有几个镜头对着你
<40-9,Chandler>So how many cameras are actually on you?

325
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,880
<41-1,MONICA>爸  关掉啦

<42-1,RACHEL>我没舞伴不能去舞会  时间来不及了
<42-1,RACHEL>I can't go to my prom without a date. I can't. It's too late.

330
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,390
<42-2,MONICA>要是你不去  我也不想去了
<42-2,MONICA>If you're not going, then I don't want to go either.

331
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,990
<42-3,MRS. GELLER>我有个好主意
<42-3,MRS. GELLER>I have a wonderful idea.

<42-3,MRS. GELLER>你带瑞秋去参加舞会
<42-3,MRS. GELLER>You should take Rachel to the prom.

<43-9,MRS. GELLER>杰克  要怎么关掉
<43-9,MRS. GELLER>Jack, how do I turn this off?

345
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,130
<43-10,Monica>你居然那样做了
<43-10,Monica>I can't believe you did that.

346
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,930
<43-11,Ross>我就...
<43-11,Ross>Yeah, well...

347
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,350
<43-12,Phoebe>看吧  他是她的龙虾
<43-12,Phoebe>See? He's her lobster!

348
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,550
<43-2,All>不会吧
<43-2,All>No.

349
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,860
<43-13,Monica>你真的不去吗
<43-13,Monica>You're really not going?

350
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,160
<43-13,Monica>我会很难面对
<43-13,Monica>It's just going to be too hard.

351
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
<43-14,Rachel>毕竟...
<43-14,Rachel>You know, I mean...

352
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,460
<43-14,Rachel>是罗斯啊
<43-14,Rachel>...it's Ross.

353
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,880
<43-14,Rachel>我怎么能看着他结婚
<43-14,Rachel>How can I watch him get married?

354
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,230
<40-3,Monica>这样最好  真的
<40-3,Monica>It's just for the best. You know? It is.

355
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,440
<43-14,Rachel>而且总得有人陪菲比
<43-14,Rachel>Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.

356
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,970
<43-14,Rachel>到时她的肚子就会很大了
<43-14,Rachel>She's going to be pretty big by then.

357
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,230
<43-14,Rachel>她会需要别人绑鞋带
<43-14,Rachel>She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.

358
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,220
<43-14,Rachel>在她要生的时候开车送她去医院
<43-14,Rachel>Drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor.

359
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,530
<43-15,Monica>你没有车
<43-15,Monica>You don't have a car.

360
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,530
<43-15,Monica>驾照也过期了
<43-15,Monica>And your license expired.

361
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,920
<43-16,Rachel>事情那么多  时间却那么少
<43-16,Rachel>There's so much to do, and I have so little time to do it in!

362
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,600
<44-1,Chandler>你们看
<44-1,Chandler>Check it out. Check this out.

363
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,980
<44-1,Chandler>上面提到  有个地方可以租到
<44-1,Chandler>It says here that there's a place you can go

364
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,950
<44-1,Chandler>所有博物馆的录影带
<44-1,Chandler>to rent videos of all the museums.

365
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,620
<44-1,Chandler>"几乎如同身历其境"
<44-1,Chandler>"It's almost as good as being there."

366
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,920
<44-2,Joey>这样更棒  去博物馆还不能只穿内裤
<44-2,Joey>It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear.

367
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,820
<44-3,Chandler>可以  但之后你会遭到封杀
<44-3,Chandler>You could, but probably just the one time.

368
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,850
<44-4,Joey>我们可以去租景点录影带
<44-4,Joey>I bet we could get videos of all the sights

369
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,340
<44-4,Joey>在酒店房间放台录放影机  就能足不出户了
<44-4,Joey>get a VCR in our hotel room and never have to go outside!

370
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,600
<44-5,Chandler>那一定要租《虎胆龙威》
