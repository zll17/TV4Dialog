<2-2,PHOEBE>不  这种游戏太荒谬了
<2-2,PHOEBE>No. This game is grotesque.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,980
<2-2,PHOEBE>把二十个无臂男人
<2-2,PHOEBE>Twenty armless guys

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,020
<2-2,PHOEBE>用钢棒穿过腰间串成一串
<2-2,PHOEBE>joined at the waist by a steel bar,

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,270
<2-2,PHOEBE>被迫无止境地踢足球
<2-2,PHOEBE>forced to play soccer forever.

<2-3,CHANDLER>菲比  不要为他们难过
<2-3,CHANDLER>Ya know Pheebs, don't feel so bad for'em.

40
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,280
<2-3,CHANDLER>等他们踢完足球后
<2-3,CHANDLER>After they're done playing,

41
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,760
<2-3,CHANDLER>我会把小塑胶妞拿出来
<2-3,CHANDLER>I break out the little plastic women

42
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,600
<2-3,CHANDLER>大家都非常开心呀
<2-3,CHANDLER>and everybody has a pretty good time.

43
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,330
<2-4,PHOEBE>你干嘛不跟你室友玩
<2-4,PHOEBE>Why don't you play with your roommate?

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,050
<2-5,CHANDLER>他不爱玩桌上足球
<2-5,CHANDLER>Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,690
<2-6,PHOEBE>你跟那个新来的处得不好吗
<2-6,PHOEBE>Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?

<2-7,CHANDLER>不是啊  他很好
<2-7,CHANDLER>No he's, he's alright,

47
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,200
<2-7,CHANDLER>只是多数时间他都关在房里
<2-7,CHANDLER>just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,760
<2-8,PHOEBE>那也许是因为  你没花时间去了解他
<2-8,PHOEBE>Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him.

49
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,850
<2-8,PHOEBE>我们来补救  好不好
<2-8,PHOEBE>Let's remedy that, shall we?

50
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,570
<2-9,CHANDLER>我们不需要补救
<2-9,CHANDLER>We don't need to remedy that.

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,430
<6-7,JOEY>剧本上的台词是
<6-7,JOEY>Well the line in the script was,

141
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,790
<6-7,JOEY>我们不送这女人去医院的话  她会死的
<6-7,JOEY>'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.'

142
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,620
<6-7,JOEY>被我改成了  这个女人不去医院的话

<6-9,JOEY>是嘛  我倒没有考虑过那些编剧
<6-9,JOEY>Huh? Never really thought about the writers.

<6-9,JOEY>剧本总是送来我家
<6-9,JOEY>The scripts just kinda come to my house.

149
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,230
<6-9,JOEY>但你知道吗  这样让我很有面子
<6-9,JOEY>But you know what? This makes me look good,

150
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,240
<6-9,JOEY>就让电视剧有了面子
<6-9,JOEY>which makes the show look good,

151
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,680
<6-9,JOEY>也让编剧有了面子
<6-9,JOEY>which makes the writers look good

152
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,230
<6-9,JOEY>他们怎么可能会生我的气呢
<6-9,JOEY>so how could they be mad about that?

156
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,880
<7-1,WRITER>这什么意思  我跌下了电梯井
<7-1,WRITER>What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?

157
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,820
<8-1,JOEY>我不知道  我只是送剧本过来
<8-1,JOEY>Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.

158
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,770
<8-2,DELIVERY GUY>他们不能杀我

162
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,650
<8-6,DELIVERY GUY>我不认为这对剧情会有什么影响
<8-6,DELIVERY GUY>I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.

163
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,200
<8-7,JOEY>他们怎么能这么对我
<8-7,JOEY>How can they do this to me?

<9-1,MONICA>Well it wasn't that many guys.

166
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,090
<9-1,MONICA>如果你考虑到全世界有多少男人的话
<9-1,MONICA>I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are,

167
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,300
<9-1,MONICA>那个比例是非常小的
<9-1,MONICA>it's a very small percentage.

168
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,040
<9-2,RACHEL>没什么大不了的  我只是好奇罢了
<9-2,RACHEL>Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.

199
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,150
<9-22,RACHEL>那只能算是无意义的野兽般的性关系
<9-22,RACHEL>All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex.

<13-12,ROSS>你怎么不告诉我们呢
<13-12,ROSS>How could you not tell us?

350
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,140
<13-13,JOEY>我不知道  我有点希望没有人会发现
<13-13,JOEY>I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.

351
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,070
<13-14,RACHEL>或许他们可以让你起死回生
<13-14,RACHEL>Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.

352
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,090
<13-15,JOEY>不会  他们说找到我尸体时
<13-15,JOEY>Naa, they said that when they found my body,

353
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,990
<13-15,JOEY>我的脑袋已经摔得稀巴烂了

354
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,700
<13-15,JOEY>而唯一救得了我的人是我
<13-15,JOEY>the only doctor that could have saved me was me.

355
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,120
<13-15,JOEY>说是故意要看起来讽刺什么的
<13-15,JOEY>Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.

<13-16,PHOEBE>乔伊  你不会有事的
<13-16,PHOEBE>But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

357
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,100
<13-16,PHOEBE>你不需要那个节目  那只是个很蠢的肥皂剧
<13-16,PHOEBE>You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.

358
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,080

<13-19,MONICA>我把你的浴帘拉开了  以免发霉
<13-19,MONICA>Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.

362
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,540
<13-19,MONICA>怎么了  我觉得这是好事啊
<13-19,MONICA>What? To me that's nice.

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,770
<13-21,JOEY>就好像你奋斗了一辈子去追求
<13-21,JOEY>It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin'

366
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,850

<13-21,JOEY>永远不会像你想的那样好
<13-21,JOEY>it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be.

368
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,240
<13-21,JOEY>不过这个就跟想象的一样好  它改变了一切
