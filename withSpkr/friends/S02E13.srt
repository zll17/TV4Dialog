135
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,990
<5-12,PHOEBE>用叉子干什么
<5-12,PHOEBE>Stick a fork what?

136
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,010
<5-13,CHANDLER>像你煎牛排那样
<5-13,CHANDLER>Like when you're cooking a steak.

137
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,020
<5-14,PHOEBE>好吧  我不吃肉
<5-14,PHOEBE>O.K. I don't eat meat.

138
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,220
<5-15,CHANDLER>那你怎么知道菜熟了呢
<5-15,CHANDLER>How do you know vegetables are done?

139
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,440
<5-16,PHOEBE>不知道啊  只要吃一口就知道了
<5-16,PHOEBE>Well, you don't. You eat them and you can tell.

140
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,480
<5-17,CHANDLER>那吃我吧  我熟了
<5-17,CHANDLER>Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

141
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,740
<5-18,CHANDLER>这个女人真是无可挑剔
<5-18,CHANDLER>I've met the perfect woman.

142
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,940
<5-18,CHANDLER>我们坐在沙发上  正在亲热
<5-18,CHANDLER>We're sitting on her couch, fooling around...

143
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,600
<5-18,CHANDLER>突然她转过来对我说
<5-18,CHANDLER>...and then she turns to me and says:

144
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,680
<5-18,CHANDLER>"你想过在电梯里做吗"
<5-18,CHANDLER>"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"

145
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,400
<5-19,MONICA>那你说什么
<5-19,MONICA>What did you say?

146
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,410
<5-20,CHANDLER>我相信我的回答是"呦嘻呼啦"
<5-20,CHANDLER>I believe my exact words were 'Flaign,en - sten'.

147
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,850
<5-20,CHANDLER>我不知道该说什么  你怎么知道你想不想在电梯里做
<5-20,CHANDLER>I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?

148
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,290
<5-21,PHOEBE>你就是知道
<5-21,PHOEBE>You just know.

149
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,800
<6-1,SUSIE>该死  我们得走了  我定了30分钟后的位子
<6-1,SUSIE>Shoot. We gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,620
<6-1,SUSIE>不不不
<6-1,SUSIE>Oh no no no no, no no no no no no,

151
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,160
<6-2,CHANDLER>我的计划最多不会超过两三分钟的
<6-2,CHANDLER>you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.

152
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,250
<6-3,SUSIE>两百秒钟的激情  我们得走了
<6-3,SUSIE>Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.

153
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,320
<6-3,SUSIE>但是
<6-3,SUSIE>But...

154
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,740
<6-4,SUSIE>我有个主意
<6-4,SUSIE>... here's an idea.

155
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,780
<6-4,SUSIE>你有没有穿过女人的内裤
<6-4,SUSIE>Have you ever worn women's underwear?

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,280
<6-5,CHANDLER>实际上穿过
<6-5,CHANDLER>Well, yes, actually...

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,370
<6-5,CHANDLER>是我艾德娜姑妈的
<6-5,CHANDLER>... but they were my Aunt Edna's.

158
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,480
<6-5,CHANDLER>一条裤子里挤了三个人
<6-5,CHANDLER>And there were three of us in there.

159
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,920
<6-6,SUSIE>我在想  如果你今天吃晚饭时
<6-6,SUSIE>I was thinking it would be kind of sexy...

160
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,820
<6-6,SUSIE>穿我的内裤  会很性感
<6-6,SUSIE>...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

161
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,700
<6-7,CHANDLER>你要我穿你内裤
<6-7,CHANDLER>You want me to wear your panties?

162
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,250
<6-8,SUSIE>可以吗
<6-8,SUSIE>Could you?

163
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,360
<6-9,CHANDLER>如果我穿了你内裤
<6-9,CHANDLER>If I was wearing your underwear...

164
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,570
<6-9,CHANDLER>那你穿什么
<6-9,CHANDLER>...then what would you be wearing?

165
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,300
<6-9,CHANDLER>你真棒
<6-9,CHANDLER>You're swell!

166
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,090
<7-1,ROSS>你看  我做了马塞尔最喜欢吃的餐点  香蕉蛋糕
<7-1,ROSS>Check it out. I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake...

167
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,570
<7-3,ROSS>加了虫子
<7-3,ROSS>...with mealworm.

168
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
<7-3,ROSS>蜡烛
<7-3,ROSS>Candle.

169
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,820

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,620
<7-5,ROSS>不  小事一桩
<7-5,ROSS>No, it's no big deal.

173
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,010
<7-5,ROSS>我又没什么特别的计划
<7-5,ROSS>It's not like I had anything special planned.

212
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,860
<9-7,SUSIE>为什么我满脑子都想着把那冰块放进嘴里
<9-7,SUSIE>How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth...

213
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,620
<9-7,SUSIE>然后舔遍你的全身
<9-7,SUSIE>...and licking you all over?

214
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,540
<9-8,CHANDLER>因为我的高中是男校  现在神要补偿我
<9-8,CHANDLER>Because I went to an all-boys high school, and God is making up for it?

<9-35,SUSIE>不如二十年后你再打电话告诉我是不是还耿耿于怀
<9-35,SUSIE>Why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.

<10-5,MONICA>那你为什么会为我破例呢
<10-5,MONICA>What made you make the exception for me?

259
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,970
<10-6,VAN DAMME>因为瑞秋告诉我说
<10-6,VAN DAMME>Because Rachel told me...
