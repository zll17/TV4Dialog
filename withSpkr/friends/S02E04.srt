<1-4,STRANGER>Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,360
<1-5,RACHEL>没有  但我可以帮你传话
<1-5,RACHEL>No, she doesn't. But I can get a message to her.

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,610
<1-6,STRANGER>好  告诉她  她老公找过她
<1-6,STRANGER>Great. Just tell her her husband stopped by.

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,000
<1-8,STRANGER>你怎么变出来的
<1-8,STRANGER>How did you do that?

38
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,980
<2-1,JOEY>真是不可思议  菲比  你怎么会结婚了
<2-1,JOEY>This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?

39
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,270
<2-2,PHOEBE>我们有名无实  你明白吗
<2-2,PHOEBE>I'm not "married" married, you know?

40
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,290
<2-2,PHOEBE>他只是个朋友  而且他是同性恋
<2-2,PHOEBE>He's just a friend, and he's gay...

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,020
<2-2,PHOEBE>而且他来自加拿大  他需要绿卡
<2-2,PHOEBE>...and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,040
<2-3,MONICA>我不相信你嫁给了邓肯
<2-3,MONICA>I can't believe you married Duncan!

43
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,060
<2-3,MONICA>你怎么没告诉我  我们住一起  无话不谈
<2-3,MONICA>How could you not tell me?We lived together,  We told each other everything.

44
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,170
<2-4,PHOEBE>抱歉  莫妮卡  但告诉你的话  你会评头论足
<2-4,PHOEBE>I'm sorry, Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental

45
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,500
<2-5,MONICA>还不会赞成
<2-5,MONICA>and wouldn't approve.

46
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,810
<2-5,MONICA>我当然不会赞成
<2-5,MONICA>Of course I wouldn't approve!

47
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,510
<2-5,MONICA>你对那人爱得死去活来  他还是个同性恋
<2-5,MONICA>You were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,870
<2-5,MONICA>你到底怎么想的
<2-5,MONICA>What the hell were you thinking?

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,910
<2-6,ROSS>瞧  我们还以为她很爱评头论足
<2-6,ROSS>See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.

50
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,460
<2-7,PHOEBE>我并不爱他  我只是帮助一个朋友
<2-7,PHOEBE>OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.

51
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,870
<2-8,MONICA>少来  他离开后  你一个月都闷在家里没出门
<2-8,MONICA>Please, when he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month

52
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,350
<2-8,MONICA>我还看到你吃乳酪汉堡
<2-8,MONICA>And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

53
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,680
<2-10,MONICA>有没有
<2-10,MONICA>Well, didn't you?

54
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,700
<2-11,PHOEBE>有  吧
<2-11,PHOEBE>I might have.

55
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,890
<2-12,MONICA>我真不相信你没告诉我
<2-12,MONICA>I can't believe you didn't tell me.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
<2-13,PHOEBE>你会告诉我一切事情吗
<2-13,PHOEBE>Come on, like you tell me everything?

57
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,780
<2-14,MONICA>我有什么没告诉你
<2-14,MONICA>What have I not told you?

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,620
<2-14,MONICA>我不知道
<2-14,MONICA>I don't know.

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,540
<2-15,PHOEBE>比如说外面电线杆上的内衣
<2-15,PHOEBE>Umm,how about the fact that the underwear out thereon the telephone pole is yours

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,210
<2-15,PHOEBE>是你跟有趣鲍比在阳台上做爱时掉下去的
<2-15,PHOEBE>from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.

61
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,470
<2-16,RACHEL>什么
<2-16,RACHEL>What?

62
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,070
<2-17,MONICA>等等  谁告诉你的
<2-17,MONICA>Wait a minute! Who told you?

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,130
<2-17,MONICA>你死定了
<2-17,MONICA>You are dead meat.

64
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,200
<2-18,CHANDLER>我不知道那是个大秘密
<2-18,CHANDLER>I didn't know it was a big secret.

65
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,140
<2-19,MONICA>的确不是大秘密  完全不是
<2-19,MONICA>Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

66
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,560
<2-19,MONICA>比方说  就像
<2-19,MONICA>I kind of the same as, say...

67
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,250
<2-19,MONICA>有人长了三个乳头
<2-19,MONICA>... I don't know, having a third nipple!

68
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,410
<2-20,PHOEBE>你有三个乳头
<2-20,PHOEBE>You have a third nipple?

69
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,550
<2-21,CHANDLER>你这贱人
<2-21,CHANDLER>You bitch!

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,180
<2-22,ROSS>秀一秀  秀一秀
<2-22,ROSS>Whip it out! Whip it out!

71
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,300
<2-23,CHANDLER>没什么好看的   只是个小突起  没有用处
<2-23,CHANDLER>There's nothing to see! It's a tiny bump. It's totally useless.

72
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,880
<2-24,RACHEL>那你其它乳头是多功能的吗
<2-24,RACHEL>As opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?

73
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,290
<2-25,JOEY>你真是的  你说那是个小包
<2-25,JOEY>I can't believe you! You told me it was a nubbin.

74
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,300
<2-26,ROSS>乔伊  你以为小包是什么
<2-26,ROSS>Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,470
<2-27,JOEY>听到了一个名字就不会多想了
<2-27,JOEY>I don't know. You see something, you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,990
<2-27,JOEY>-让我再看一看  -对  让我们看你的小包
<2-27,JOEY>- Let me see it again! - Yes, show us your nubbin!

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,680
<2-29,CHANDLER>乔伊拍过色情电影
<2-29,CHANDLER>Joey was in a porno movie!

78
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,490
<2-30,ALL>我死也要拉个垫背的
<2-30,ALL>If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me!

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,710
<2-32,ROSS>-老天  -你拍过色情片
<2-32,ROSS>- Oh, my God! - You were in a porno?!

80
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,130
<2-33,JOEY>当时我很年轻  只想找个工作
<2-33,JOEY>I was young and I just wanted a job. Okay?

81
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,400
<2-33,JOEY>但最后一刻我无法做下去
<2-33,JOEY>But the last time I couldn't go through with it.

82
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,520
<2-33,JOEY>他们就让我演修复印机的人
<2-33,JOEY>They let me be the guy who fixes the copier but can't...

83
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,560
<2-33,JOEY>但因为有人在上面做爱  所以没能修好
<2-33,JOEY>...because there's people having sex on it.

84
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,610
<2-34,MONICA>真是狂野
<2-34,MONICA>That is wild!

85
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,940
<2-36,PHOEBE>-形状是什么样子  -有没有长毛
<2-36,PHOEBE>- What's it shaped like? - Yeah, is there a hair on it?

86
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,320
<2-37,JOEY>弹一下会怎么样
<2-37,JOEY>What happens if you flick it?

88
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,480
<3-1,ROSS>有没有什么特殊功能
<3-1,ROSS>So does it do anything, you know, special?

89
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,740
<3-2,CHANDLER>只要压我的第三个乳头
<3-2,CHANDLER>Pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance...

90
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,240
<3-2,CHANDLER>就会开启仙境之门
<3-2,CHANDLER>...to the magical land of Narnia.

91
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,790
<3-3,JULIE>在有些文明中  第三个乳头象征了男性雄风
<3-3,JULIE>In some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.

92
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,880
<3-3,JULIE>会有热辣的女人光着身子围绕你跳舞
<3-3,JULIE>You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,560
<3-4,CHANDLER>这些文明是否可能在三州交界处
<3-4,CHANDLER>Are any of these cultures, per chance, in the Tri-State area?

94
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,880
<3-5,ROSS>你真是博学多闻  有什么是你不知道的
<3-5,ROSS>You know, you are so amazing. Is there anything you don't know?

95
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,990
<3-6,RACHEL>朱莉好聪明  朱莉好特别
<3-6,RACHEL>Julie's so smart! Julie's so special!

96
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,880
<3-7,MONICA>亲爱的  我也希望你能与罗斯复合
<3-7,MONICA>Look, honey. I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.

97
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,570
<3-7,MONICA>但现在他与她在一起  你必须看开
<3-7,MONICA>But he's with her now. You'll have to get over it.

98
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,140
<3-8,RACHEL>原来我必须看开
<3-8,RACHEL>Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

99
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,950
<3-8,RACHEL>我不知道该怎么办  原来只要看开就好
<3-8,RACHEL>I didn't know that's what I had to do. I just have to get over it.

100
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,260
<3-11,JULIE>-性感美女  -你要去哪里
<3-11,JULIE>- Sassy lady! - Where are you going?

101
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,200
<3-12,PHOEBE>我要去见邓肯  今晚他要去公园溜冰
<3-12,PHOEBE>I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden,

102
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,770
<3-12,PHOEBE>他是溜冰表演团的
<3-12,PHOEBE>He's in the Capades.

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,580
<3-14,CHANDLER>-白雪溜冰团吗  -不  是在柏油路上表演
<3-14,CHANDLER>- The lce Capades? - No, the Gravel Capades.

105
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,200
<3-14,CHANDLER>转得不会很快  可史努比跌倒时非常好笑
<3-14,CHANDLER>The turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,720
<3-15,MONICA>你竟然为他打扮了一番
<3-15,MONICA>I can't believe you'd dress up for him.

107
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,150
<3-15,MONICA>你又要重蹈覆辙了
<3-15,MONICA>You're setting yourself up all over again.

108
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,510
<3-15,MONICA>不会的
<3-15,MONICA>Okay, no.

109
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,840
<3-16,PHOEBE>告诉你好了  我去看他只是为了能彻底忘了他
<3-16,PHOEBE>For your information,  I'm going to see him so I can put all those feelings behind me.

110
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,960
<3-16,PHOEBE>我这样打扮是因为我要让
<3-16,PHOEBE>The reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice...

111
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,770
<3-16,PHOEBE>我的同性恋丈夫有面子
<3-16,PHOEBE>...to look nice for your gay husband.

112
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,970
<3-17,ROSS>该死  没牛奶了
<3-17,ROSS>Darn it, we're all out of milk.

<3-17,ROSS>钱德勒  能不能给我挤一点
<3-17,ROSS>Chandler, will you fill me up here?

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,990
<3-18,CHANDLER>我懂了  因为我有第三个乳头
<3-18,CHANDLER>I see, I see. Because of the third-nipple thing.

124
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,430
<4-13,ROSS>最长一次是多久
<4-13,ROSS>... having the sex?

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,090
<4-14,RACHEL>你和朱莉还没有发生关系
<4-14,RACHEL>Are you and Julie not having sex?

127
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,820
<4-15,ROSS>严格说来

<4-15,ROSS>No.

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,370
<4-16,RACHEL>是不是因为她性冷淡
<4-16,RACHEL>Is it because she's so cold in bed?

130
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,650
<4-16,RACHEL>还是因为她有点专横  感觉还不成熟
<4-16,RACHEL>Or because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?

131
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,510
<4-17,ROSS>不  她很好  我们又不是什么都没做
<4-17,ROSS>No! She's great. And it's not like we haven't done anything.

132
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,250
<4-17,ROSS>我们做了很多事情  像是
<4-17,ROSS>We do plenty of other stuff. Lots of other stuff like...

133
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,420
<4-18,RACHEL>不  没必要告诉我细节
<4-18,RACHEL>No! Don't need to know the details.

134
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,230
<4-18,RACHEL>不  只是
<4-18,RACHEL>No, it's just....

135
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,900
<4-19,ROSS>我的问题
<4-19,ROSS>It's me.

136
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,730
<4-19,ROSS>我一辈子只跟一个人上过床
<4-19,ROSS>I've only been with one woman my whole life...

137
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,280
<4-19,ROSS>后来她变成了同性恋
<4-19,ROSS>...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

138
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,130
<4-19,ROSS>所以现在我很害怕
<4-19,ROSS>So now I've got myself all psyched out.

139
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,000
<4-19,ROSS>就像是
<4-19,ROSS>It's become, like, this...

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,830
<4-19,ROSS>这件事
<4-19,ROSS>...this thing!

141
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,080
<4-19,ROSS>你一定以为我很怪
<4-19,ROSS>You must just think I'm weird.

142
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,370
<4-20,RACHEL>不  我不认为很怪
<4-20,RACHEL>No, I don't think it's weird.

143
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,210
<4-20,RACHEL>我想
<4-20,RACHEL>I think, in fact....

144
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,660
<4-20,RACHEL>-你知道我怎么想吗  -怎么想
<4-20,RACHEL>- ln fact, you know what I think? - What?

145
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,740
<4-22,RACHEL>我觉得这很性感
<4-22,RACHEL>I think it's sexy.

146
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,650
<4-23,ROSS>性感
<4-23,ROSS>Sexy?

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
<4-24,RACHEL>让我告诉你  身为女人
<4-24,RACHEL>Let me tell you something. As a woman...

148
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,700
<4-24,RACHEL>没有任何事情
<4-24,RACHEL>...there is nothing sexier...

149
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,230
<4-24,RACHEL>比不想要做爱的男人更性感
<4-24,RACHEL>...than a man who does not want to have sex.

150
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,790
<4-25,ROSS>真的
<4-25,ROSS>No kidding?

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,730
<4-26,RACHEL>你知道我会怎么做
<4-26,RACHEL>In fact, you know what I'd do?

152
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,430
<4-27,ROSS>我会等
<4-27,ROSS>I'd wait.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,860
<4-29,ROSS>-你会等  -没错  我会等待
<4-29,ROSS>- You'd wait? - Yes, absolutely. I would wait...

<4-30,RACHEL>...and wait....

155
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,700
<4-30,RACHEL>然后我会一等再等
<4-30,RACHEL>Then I'd wait some more.

156
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,430
<4-31,ROSS>真的
<4-31,ROSS>Really?

157
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,960
<4-32,RACHEL>我不管她说有多想要  她苦苦哀求
<4-32,RACHEL>I don't care if she tells you she wants it, she begs, she pleads...

158
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,330
<4-32,RACHEL>她说她要跟其他男人做爱
<4-32,RACHEL>...she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man

159
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,830
<4-32,RACHEL>这只表示收到了效果
<4-32,RACHEL>That just means it's working.

160
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,690
<4-33,ROSS>女人真的希望这样
<4-33,ROSS>Women really want this?

161
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,930
<4-34,RACHEL>比对珠宝还要渴望
<4-34,RACHEL>More than jewelry.

<6-9,ROSS>I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,440
<6-10,RACHEL>很好  他怎么说
<6-10,RACHEL>Good. What did he say?

190
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,640
<6-11,ROSS>他要我克服心理障碍  只管去做
<6-11,ROSS>Basically, he told me to get over myself and just do it.

191
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,130
<6-11,ROSS>我权衡了你的话和他的话
<6-11,ROSS>So I thought about what you said and about what he said.

192
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,960
<6-11,ROSS>照他的话  今晚我就该做爱了  所以

231
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,720
<8-10,DUNCAN>但是到了某个程度  就无法再自欺欺人了
<8-10,DUNCAN>But you reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,150
<8-12,DUNCAN>我以为自己不是
<8-12,DUNCAN>I thought I was supposed to be something else.

00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,390
<8-16,DUNCAN>我说服自己是酒精作用  大学每个人都在摸索
<8-16,DUNCAN>But I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.

244
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,100
<8-17,PHOEBE>当然
<8-17,PHOEBE>Sure.

245
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,200
<8-18,DUNCAN>现在我知道我别无选择
<8-18,DUNCAN>Now I know I don't have a choice about this.

246
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,530
<8-18,DUNCAN>我天生如此
<8-18,DUNCAN>I was born this way!

248
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,380
<8-19,PHOEBE>我不知道该说什么
<8-19,PHOEBE>I don't know what to say.

249
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,290
<8-19,PHOEBE>嫁给一个人六年  以为自己很了解他
<8-19,PHOEBE>You're married to someone for six years and you think you know him.

250
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,610
<8-19,PHOEBE>结果一天他突然说  我不是同性恋
<8-19,PHOEBE>And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay!"

251
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,370
<8-20,DUNCAN>我还是我
<8-20,DUNCAN>I'm still me.

252
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,640
<8-21,PHOEBE>你为什么在六年前没有发现这件事
<8-21,PHOEBE>Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?

253
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,700
<9-1,MONICA>里面闻起来还是有猴骚味
<9-1,MONICA>You know, it still smells like monkey in there.

255
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,720
<9-2,JULIE>我们又有话题可聊了
<9-2,JULIE>That saves us the conversation.

256
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,700
<9-3,CHANDLER>今晚很好玩  但我累死了
<9-3,CHANDLER>Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.

257
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,440
<9-4,JOEY>我也是  我们该走了
<9-4,JOEY>Me too. We should get going.

258
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,260
<9-5,RACHEL>不  你们别这样
<9-5,RACHEL>No! Come on, you guys!

259
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
<9-5,RACHEL>现在才十一点半
<9-5,RACHEL>Come on, it's only 11 :30.

260
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,440
<9-5,RACHEL>我们好好聊聊  我们好久都没有一起聊过天了
<9-5,RACHEL>Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.

261
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,420
<9-6,MONICA>瑞秋  我们在一起只会聊天
<9-6,MONICA>Rachel, that's all we do.

262
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,230
<9-7,RACHEL>也许我们是这样  但是朱莉呢
<9-7,RACHEL>Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?

263
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,840
<9-8,JULIE>朱莉怎么样
<9-8,JULIE>What about Julie?

264
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,110
<9-9,RACHEL>你已经融入我们将近两个月了
<9-9,RACHEL>You have been in our lives for nearly two months now...

265
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,490
<9-9,RACHEL>可我们还没有真正认识你
<9-9,RACHEL>...and we don't really know you.

266
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,750
<9-9,RACHEL>朱莉是什么样的人
<9-9,RACHEL>I mean, who is Julie?

267
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,730
<9-9,RACHEL>你喜欢什么  不喜欢什么
<9-9,RACHEL>What do you like? What don't you like?

268
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,350
<9-9,RACHEL>统统告诉我们
<9-9,RACHEL>We want to know everything.

269
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,050
<9-10,JULIE>这可能要花一段时间
<9-10,JULIE>Well, that could take a while.

270
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,660
<9-10,JULIE>所以呢
<9-10,JULIE>So?

271
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,180
<9-11,RACHEL>谁没有时间深入了解朱莉
<9-11,RACHEL>Who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?

272
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,200
<9-12,CHANDLER>-我有时间来了解朱莉  -我有时间
<9-12,CHANDLER>- I got the time to get to know Julie. - I got time.

273
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,510
<9-14,MONICA>瑞秋  我跟她很熟了  我能回去吗
<9-14,MONICA>Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go?

274
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,470
<9-14,MONICA>没关系
<9-14,MONICA>That's fine.

275
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,240
<9-15,RACHEL>朱莉  从你的童年开始讲起吧  是怎么样的
<9-15,RACHEL>OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood. What was that like?

276
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,460
<9-16,JULIE>简单地说
<9-16,JULIE>In a nutshell

277
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,490
<10-1,PHOEBE>你告诉你父母了吗
<10-1,PHOEBE>So, have you told your parents?

278
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,770
<10-2,DUNCAN>还没有  应该没关系  他们不会介意
<10-2,DUNCAN>No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.

279
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,660
<10-2,DUNCAN>我弟弟是直男  所以
<10-2,DUNCAN>My brother's straight, so....

280
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,870
<10-3,PHOEBE>给你
<10-3,PHOEBE>Here you go.

281
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,500
<10-3,PHOEBE>我还有一个问题
<10-3,PHOEBE>You know what? I just have one more question.

282
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,430
<10-3,PHOEBE>如果你早一点知道  而我也在你身边
<10-3,PHOEBE>If you had figured this out sooner, and I had been around...

283
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,110
<10-3,PHOEBE>你想会不会是我
<10-3,PHOEBE>...do you think l would have been the one who...?

284
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,000
<10-3,PHOEBE>不  没关系  别告诉我
<10-3,PHOEBE>No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,620
<10-3,PHOEBE>不管是什么回答  都不会让我更好过  给
<10-3,PHOEBE>I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.

286
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,010
<10-4,DUNCAN>我爱你  菲比
<10-4,DUNCAN>I love you, Phoebe.

287
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,710
<10-5,PHOEBE>你弟弟是直男
<10-5,PHOEBE>So your brother's straight, huh?

288
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,280
<10-5,PHOEBE>说真的
<10-5,PHOEBE>Seriously.

289
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,590
<11-1,JULIE>我的二年级老师是汤玛丝小姐
<11-1,JULIE>and my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas...

290
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,380
<11-1,JULIE>我的一年级老师是柯布小姐
<11-1,JULIE>...and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.

291
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,430
<11-2,RAHCEL>葛布小姐
<11-2,RAHCEL>Mrs. Gobb?

292
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,680
<11-3,JULIE>不  柯布  就像柯布沙拉
<11-3,JULIE>No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

293
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,630
<11-4,RACHEL>柯布沙拉里面究竟有什么
<11-4,RACHEL>What exactly is in a cobb salad?

294
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,830
<11-5,CHANDLER>我要回家了
<11-5,CHANDLER>I'm going home.

295
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,160
<11-5,CHANDLER>朱莉可真是话唠
<11-5,CHANDLER>Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

296
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,600
<12-1,ROSS>晚安
<12-1,ROSS>Good night.

297
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,240
<11-9,RACHEL>很晚了  你大概还没有打算
<11-9,RACHEL>It's pretty late. You're probably not still planning on....

298
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,670
<11-10,ROSS>我有
<11-10,ROSS>No, I am.

299
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,160
<11-11,RACHEL>你紧张吗
<11-11,RACHEL>Are you nervous?

300
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,450
<11-12,ROSS>没  我以前做过
<11-12,ROSS>No. I have done it before.

301
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,630
<11-13,RACHEL>你要怎么进行
<11-13,RACHEL>I mean, how are you gonna handle it?

302
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,750
<11-13,RACHEL>你准备事先说好  还是直接上
<11-13,RACHEL>Are you gonna talk about it beforehand? Are you just gonna pounce?

303
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,940
<11-14,ROSS>我不知道  我想我要
<11-14,ROSS>I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna...

304
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,810
<11-14,ROSS>顺其自然
<11-14,ROSS>...see what happens.

305
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,720
<11-15,RAHCEL>好吧  祝你好运
<11-15,RAHCEL>Okay. Good luck!

306
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,760
<11-16,ROSS>什么  怎么了
<11-16,ROSS>What? What?

307
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,580
<11-16,ROSS>没事
<11-16,ROSS>Nothing....

308
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,600
<11-17,RACHEL>这是你与她的第一次
<11-17,RACHEL>It is your first time with her,

309
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,790
<11-17,RACHEL>如果第一次就不顺利
<11-17,RACHEL>and if the first time doesn't go well...

310
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,800
<11-17,RACHEL>那就很难再东山再起
<11-17,RACHEL>...well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.

311
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,860
<11-18,ROSS>好  现在我紧张了
<11-18,ROSS>Okay, now I'm nervous.

312
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,660
<11-19,RACHEL>也许你应该延期
<11-19,RACHEL>Maybe you should put it off.

313
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,940
<11-19,RACHEL>不  我不要延期
<11-19,RACHEL>No, I don't want to put it off!

314
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,400
<11-20,ROSS>我去年一整年都痛苦不堪
<11-20,ROSS>I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.

315
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,500
<11-20,ROSS>现在我很快乐
<11-20,ROSS>And now I'm actually happy.

316
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,990
<11-20,ROSS>真的很快乐
<11-20,ROSS>You know, I mean really happy.

317
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,010
<11-20,ROSS>我不希望
<11-20,ROSS>I just don't wanna....

318
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,290
<11-20,ROSS>我不希望搞砸了  你知道吧
<11-20,ROSS>I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

319
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,090
<11-21,RACHEL>我知道
<11-21,RACHEL>I know.

320
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,370
<11-21,RACHEL>对不起
<11-21,RACHEL>I'm sorry.

321
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,920
<11-22,ROSS>不  这又不是你的错
<11-22,ROSS>No, it's not your fault.

322
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,540
<11-22,ROSS>对
<11-22,ROSS>Right.

323
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,060
<11-23,RACHEL>也许不需要这么困难
<11-23,RACHEL>Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

324
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,080
<11-23,RACHEL>也许你顺其自然是对的
<11-23,RACHEL>Maybe you were on the right track with that whole "spontaneous" thing.

325
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,800
<11-24,ROSS>-女人都喜欢这样  -真的
<11-24,ROSS>- Women really like that. - Really?

326
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,550
<11-25,RACHEL>对  如果是我
<11-25,RACHEL>Yeah. I mean if it were me,

327
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,600
<11-25,RACHEL>我会希望你
<11-25,RACHEL>I'd want you to....

328
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,480
<11-25,RACHEL>趁我没有防备的时候
<11-25,RACHEL>I don't know, catch me off guard with like a really...

329
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,070
<12-1,ROSS>好好给我一个吻
<12-1,ROSS>...good kiss.

330
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,050
<11-24,ROSS>刚开始要很轻柔
<11-24,ROSS>Really sort of soft at first.

331
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,160
<11-25,RACHEL>然后也许把我的头发拨开
<11-25,RACHEL>And then maybe brush the hair away from my face.

332
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,560
<11-25,RACHEL>凝视我的眼睛
<11-25,RACHEL>And then look far into my eyes...

333
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,800
<11-25,RACHEL>让我知道有美妙的事情
<11-25,RACHEL>...in a way that lets me know something...

334
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,780
<11-25,RACHEL>快要发生了
<11-25,RACHEL>...amazing is about to happen.

335
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,410
<11-27,RACHEL>然后  我不知道  然后
<11-27,RACHEL>And then, I don't know, then...

336
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,560
<11-27,RACHEL>你会把我搂得更紧
<11-27,RACHEL>...you'd pull me really close to you so that...

337
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,600
<11-27,RACHEL>这样我就会紧紧贴着你
<11-27,RACHEL>...so that I'd be pressed up right against you.

338
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,500
<11-27,RACHEL>然后就会开始
<11-27,RACHEL>And it would get kind of...

339
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,770
<11-27,RACHEL>流汗
<11-27,RACHEL>...sweaty...

340
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,640
<11-27,RACHEL>目眩神迷
<11-27,RACHEL>...and blurry.

341
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,740
<11-27,RACHEL>一切就自然发生
<11-27,RACHEL>And then it's just happening.

342
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,840
<11-28,ROSS>谢谢  瑞秋  晚安
<11-28,ROSS>Thanks, Rach. Good night!

343
