00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,490
<14-4,Chandler>嗨  珍妮斯
<14-4,Chandler>Hey, Janice.

249
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,540
<14-4,Chandler>我不该告诉你这些
<14-4,Chandler>There's no way to tell you this.

250
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,390
<14-4,Chandler>至少没有别的方法来告诉你
<14-4,Chandler>At least, there's no new way.

251
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,890
<14-4,Chandler>我只是觉得我们不会有结果
<14-4,Chandler>I just don't think things are gonna work out.

252
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,480
<14-5,Janice>无所谓
<14-5,Janice>That's fine.

253
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,190
<14-6,Chandler>是吗
<14-6,Chandler>It is?

254
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,280
<14-7,Janice>因为我知道我们还没结束
<14-7,Janice>Because I know that this isn't the end.

255
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:57,000
<14-8,Chandler>事实上  已经结束了
<14-8,Chandler>You see, actually, it is.

256
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,180
<14-9,Janice>不  还没  因为你不会让它发生的
<14-9,Janice>No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen.

257
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,880
<14-9,Janice>难道你还没意识到
<14-9,Janice>Don't you know it yet?

258
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,870
<14-9,Janice>你爱我  钱德勒·宾
<14-9,Janice>You love me, Chandler Bing!

259
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,270
<14-10,Chandler>不  我不爱
<14-10,Chandler>Oh, no, I don't.

260
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,560
<14-11,Janice>那么就扪心自问  我们为何总是会复合
<14-11,Janice>Then ask yourself this. Why do we keep ending up together?

261
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,730
<14-11,Janice>新年是谁邀的谁
<14-11,Janice>New Year's, who invited who?

262
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,940
<14-11,Janice>情人节是谁邀谁上床
<14-11,Janice>Valentine's, who asked who into bed?

263
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,640
<14-12,Chandler>-是我  可是...  -我是你寻找的对象
<14-12,Chandler>- I did, but - You seek me out!

264
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,880
<14-13,Janice>你的内心深处不断呼喊着我
<14-13,Janice>Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!

265
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,940
<14-13,Janice>珍妮斯  珍妮斯...
<14-13,Janice>Janice! Janice!

266
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,680
<14-13,Janice>你要我  你需要我
<14-13,Janice>You want me. You need me.

267
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,090
<14-13,Janice>你不能没有我  你知道这点的
<14-13,Janice>You can't live without me. And you know it.

268
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,920
<14-13,Janice>你只是不知道你知道罢了
<14-13,Janice>You just don't know you know it.

269
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,720
<14-13,Janice>明白吗
<14-13,Janice>See?

270
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,810
<14-14,Chandler>打电话给我
<14-14,Chandler>Call me!

271
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,440
<15-1,Carol>这不是真的  我没说过你妈像狼獾
<15-1,Carol>It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.

272
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,050
<15-2,Ross>你有  我发誓
<15-2,Ross>You did so, I swear to

273
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,110
<15-2,Ross>她上洗手间多久了
<15-2,Ross>How long has she been in the bathroom?

274
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,280
<15-3,Carol>我想她不是去洗手间  她的外套不见了
<15-3,Carol>She isn't in the bathroom. Her coat's gone.

275
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,550
<15-4,Ross>或许是里面太冷吧
<15-4,Ross>Well, maybe it's cold in there.

276
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,400
<15-4,Ross>或许我搞砸了九年来的第一次约会
<15-4,Ross>Maybe I screwed up my first date in nine years.

277
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,990
<15-5,Carol>-有可能  -天哪
<15-5,Carol>- That could be it. - Oh, God.

278
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,040
<15-6,Ross>知道吗  这上面还很烫
<15-6,Ross>You know, this is still pretty hot.

279
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,740
<15-7,Carol>蘑菇
<15-7,Carol>Mushroom.

280
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,580
<15-7,Carol>微笑
<15-7,Carol>Smile.

281
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,410
<15-7,Carol>不会每次都这样的
<15-7,Carol>They won't all be like this.

282
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,780
<15-7,Carol>还是有些女人会把晚餐吃完的
<15-7,Carol>Some might stay through dinner.

283
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,500
<15-7,Carol>-抱歉  不好笑  -只是
<15-7,Carol>- I'm sorry. That's not funny. - It's just....

284
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,590
<15-8,Ross>人们老说要继续你的人生
<15-8,Ross>You know the whole "get on with your life" thing?

285
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,630
<15-8,Ross>我必须这样吗
<15-8,Ross>Well, do I have to?

286
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,360
<15-8,Ross>我和这位美女坐在这儿
<15-8,Ross>I'm sitting here with this cute woman...

287
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,620
<15-8,Ross>她是那么好  但是...
<15-8,Ross>...and she's perfectly nice, but that...

288
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,500
<15-8,Ross>就这么吹了
<15-8,Ross>...that's it.

289
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,020
<15-8,Ross>我现在又和你聊天  轻松又自在
<15-8,Ross>Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.

290
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,660
<15-8,Ross>我何必...
<15-8,Ross>And I don't have to....

291
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,010
<15-8,Ross>-我懂  -你懂
<15-8,Ross>- I know. - You know?

292
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,230
<15-8,Ross>我有个疯狂的念头
<15-8,Ross>Here's a wacky thought.

293
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,140
<15-8,Ross>我们再试一次好吗
<15-8,Ross>Let's say you and I give it another shot.

294
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,480
<15-8,Ross>我知道你要说你是个女同志
<15-8,Ross>I know what you're gonna say. You're a lesbian.

295
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,300
<15-8,Ross>但何不暂时将它搁在一旁
<15-8,Ross>But what do you say we just put that aside for now.

296
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,930
<15-11,Carol>完全不去想它
<15-11,Carol>Let's just stick a pin in it.

297
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,630
<15-8,Ross>因为我们在一起很开心  这不容你否认
<15-8,Ross>Because we're great together. You can't deny it.

298
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,170
<15-8,Ross>此外  你怀着我的孩子
<15-8,Ross>Besides, you're carrying my baby.

299
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,850
<15-8,Ross>-这样不是很完美吗  -罗斯
<15-8,Ross>- I mean, how perfect is that? - Ross

300
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,500
<15-8,Ross>虽然你一直回绝,
<15-8,Ross>You keep saying that,

301
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,270
<15-9,Carol>但我们之间的感情还在  我爱你
<15-9,Carol>but there's something right here. I love you.

302
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,630
<15-9,Carol>我也爱你
<15-9,Carol>I love you too.

303
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,090
<15-10,Ross>-但是  -不要但是
<15-10,Ross>- But - No "but."

304
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,360
<15-11,Carol>你要知道  暂时放置一旁的事
<15-11,Carol>You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?

305
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,650
<15-11,Carol>迟早会浮现的
<15-11,Carol>It's time to take the pin out.

308
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,130
<15-12,Ross>你说得倒是轻松  你已找到对的人
<15-12,Ross>It's easy for you to say. You found one already.

309
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,430
<15-13,Carol>你只需找到爱男人的女人即可
<15-13,Carol>All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set.
