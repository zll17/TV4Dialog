00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,700
<2-18,Chandler>他打来电话  我说"钱德勒·宾"

<2-24,Ross>我想我终于搞清楚了
<2-24,Ross>You know I think I finally figured out

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,990
<2-24,Ross>我们最近总闹别扭的原因

<2-26,Ross>叫苏珊的女人
<2-26,Ross>"Susan" something.

75
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,730

<10-10,Phoebe>这本来是好事  但是我忘了原因
<10-10,Phoebe>That was supposed to be a good thing. I forget why.

254
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,570
<10-10,Phoebe>莫妮卡  我...
<10-10,Phoebe>Monica, I...

255
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,070
<10-10,Phoebe>知道吗  我曾经一整个月睡不着
<10-10,Phoebe>Do you know, okay, do you know I couldn't sleep for like a month

256
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,330
<10-10,Phoebe>就因为一个沙发靠垫  被我沾上了一滴墨水
<10-10,Phoebe>because I got a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions?

257
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,560
<10-11,Monica>你可以把它翻面啊
<10-11,Monica>You could've just turned the cushion over.

258
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,680
<10-12,Phoebe>我也想啊  但另一面沾上了意大利面酱汁
<10-12,Phoebe>I would have, except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.

259
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,510
<10-13,Monica>什么
<10-13,Monica>What?

260
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,630
<10-14,Phoebe>我就是这个意思
<10-14,Phoebe>Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

261
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,180
<10-14,Phoebe>我要住在可以打翻东西的地方
<10-14,Phoebe>I need to live in a land where people can spill!

262
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,210
<10-15,Monica>你可以打翻东西啊
<10-15,Monica>Well, you can spill.

263
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,730
<10-15,Monica>在水槽里
<10-15,Monica>In the sink.

264
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,270
<10-16,Phoebe>亲爱的  不是你不好  你就是这样的人
<10-16,Phoebe>Oh, honey. It's not your fault, you know. This is who you are.

265
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,820
<10-16,Phoebe>我爱你  我想跟你做朋友
<10-16,Phoebe>And I love you. And I want us to be friends.

266
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,480
<10-16,Phoebe>要是我继续住这里  那是不可能的
<10-16,Phoebe>And if I keep living here, I don't see that happening.

267
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,860
<10-17,Monica>-我也爱你  -那就好
<10-17,Monica>- I love you too. - Good.

268
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,950
<10-18,Phoebe>怎么了
<10-18,Phoebe>What?

269
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,810
<10-19,Monica>什么  我只是很难过
<10-19,Monica>What? I'm just sad.

270
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,490
<10-20,Phoebe>才怪  你在想是哪一个垫子
<10-20,Phoebe>No, you're not. You're wondering which cushion it is.

271
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,450
<11-1,Chandler>在看什么
<11-1,Chandler>So what are you watching?

272
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,850
<11-2,Joey>《海滩游侠》
<11-2,Joey>Baywatch.

273
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,320
<11-3,Chandler>讲什么的
<11-3,Chandler>What's it about?

274
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,340
<11-4,Joey>救生员
<11-4,Joey>Lifeguards.

275
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,510
<11-5,Chandler>听起来蛮蠢...
<11-5,Chandler>Well, it sounds kind of stup...

276
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,050
<11-5,Chandler>她是谁
<11-5,Chandler>Who's she?

277
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,650
<11-6,Joey>妮可·艾格
<11-6,Joey>Nicole Eggert.

278
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,010
<11-6,Joey>你会喜欢上她的
<11-6,Joey>You'll like her.

279
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,970
<11-7,Chandler>哇  她们在跑
<11-7,Chandler>Wow! Look at them run!

280
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,620
<11-8,Joey>她们经常这样
<11-8,Joey>They do that a lot.

281
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,000
<11-8,Joey>你要喝啤酒吗
<11-8,Joey>Hey, you want a beer?

<11-9,Chandler>我去拿
<11-9,Chandler>Yeah, I'll go get one.

283
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,660
<11-10,Joey>别起来  这有冰桶
<11-10,Joey>No, no. Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

284
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,380
<12-1,Chandler>-有人吗  -嘿
<12-1,Chandler>- Hello! - Hey.

285
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,500
<12-3,Chandler>你有啤酒吗  我们的喝完了
<12-3,Chandler>Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.

286
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,080
<12-4,Monica>自己拿
<12-4,Monica>Help yourself.

287
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,320
<12-5,Chandler>你还好吗
<12-5,Chandler>You okay?

288
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,440
<12-6,Monica>菲比搬走了
<12-6,Monica>Phoebe moved out.

289
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,890
<12-7,Chandler>对
<12-7,Chandler>Right.

290
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,770
<12-8,Monica>我不懂
<12-8,Monica>I don't understand.

291
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,280
<12-8,Monica>我真的这么难相处吗
<12-8,Monica>Am I so hard to live with?

292
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,990
<12-8,Monica>所以才找不到男朋友吗
<12-8,Monica>Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

293
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,470
<12-9,Chandler>不是  你没有男朋友是因为...
<12-9,Chandler>No, you don't have a boyfriend because....

294
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,170
<12-9,Chandler>我不知道为什么
<12-9,Chandler>I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.

295
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,460
<12-9,Chandler>你应该有男朋友的
<12-9,Chandler>You should have a boyfriend.

296
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,790
<12-10,Monica>我也这么认为
<12-10,Monica>I think so.

297
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,930
<12-11,Chandler>过来
<12-11,Chandler>Come here.

298
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,190
<12-11,Chandler>来吧
<12-11,Chandler>Come here.

299
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,690
<12-11,Chandler>听我说  你是我最喜欢的人之一
<12-11,Chandler>Listen, you are one of my favorite people

300
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,920
<12-11,Chandler>还是我在现实中所认识的  最漂亮的女人
<12-11,Chandler>and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.

301
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,420
<13-1,Ross>人都在哪里
<13-1,Ross>Where is everybody?

302
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,670
<13-2,Phoebe>已经关门了  克里斯要我锁门
<13-2,Phoebe>It's already closed. Chris gave me the keys to lock up.

303
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,650
<13-2,Phoebe>出了什么事
<13-2,Phoebe>What is wrong?

304
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,520
<13-3,Ross>我想我的婚姻
<13-3,Ross>My marriage, I think my marriage is...

305
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,040
<13-3,Ross>应该是完蛋了
<13-3,Ross>...is kind of over.

306
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,240
<13-4,Phoebe>不会吧  为什么
<13-4,Phoebe>Oh, no! Why?

307
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,490
<13-4,Phoebe>因为卡罗尔是个女同性恋
<13-4,Phoebe>Because Carol's a lesbian.

308
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,090
<13-5,Ross>而我不是
<13-5,Ross>And I'm not one.

309
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,180
<13-5,Ross>而且这显然不是一时兴起混搭一下
<13-5,Ross>And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.

310
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,660
<13-5,Ross>天哪
<13-5,Ross>Oh, my God!

311
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,440
<13-6,Phoebe>我真不敢相信
<13-6,Phoebe>I don't believe it!

312
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,310
<13-6,Phoebe>可怜的孩子
<13-6,Phoebe>Oh, you poor bunny.

313
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,060
<13-7,Ross>我是白痴
<13-7,Ross>I'm an idiot.

314
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,720
<13-7,Ross>我早该看出来了
<13-7,Ross>I should have seen it.

315
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,390
<13-7,Ross>卡罗尔和我出门时
<13-7,Ross>I mean, Carol and I would be out,

316
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,270
<13-7,Ross>她总喜欢盯着漂亮姑娘看
<13-7,Ross>and she'd see some beautiful woman...

317
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,900
<13-7,Ross>她会说  "罗斯  你看她"
<13-7,Ross>...and she'd be "Ross! Look at her!"

318
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,460
<13-7,Ross>我还觉得
<13-7,Ross>And I'd think...

319
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,620
<13-7,Ross>天哪  我老婆真酷
<13-7,Ross>"God, my wife is cool."

320
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,390
<13-8,Phoebe>你觉得那个苏珊是她的情人吗
<13-8,Phoebe>Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?

321
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,920
<13-9,Ross>我现在知道了
<13-9,Ross>Well, now I do!

322
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,700
<13-10,Phoebe>对不起
<13-10,Phoebe>I'm sorry.

323
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,890
<13-11,Ross>都七年了
<13-11,Ross>Seven years!

324
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,660
<13-11,Ross>我们在一起七年了
<13-11,Ross>I mean, we've been together seven years.

325
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,870
<13-11,Ross>她是唯一爱过我的女人
<13-11,Ross>She's the only woman who's ever loved me.

326
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,550
<13-11,Ross>也是我唯一有过...
<13-11,Ross>She's the only woman I've ever....

327
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,280
<13-11,Ross>罗斯
<13-11,Ross>Ross.

328
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,110
<14-1,Chandler>真好
<14-1,Chandler>This is nice.

329
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,910
<14-2,Monica>我知道  很棒对不对
<14-2,Monica>I know. It is, isn't it?

330
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,600
<14-3,Chandler>我是说真的  摸起来好舒服
<14-3,Chandler>No, I mean it. This feels really good.

331
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,030
<14-3,Chandler>是纯棉的吗
<14-3,Chandler>Is it 100% cotton?

332
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,870
<14-4,Monica>对  而且还是特价品
<14-4,Monica>Yeah! And I got it on sale too.

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,240
<14-5,Chandler>我该走了
<14-5,Chandler>Anyway, I should go.

334
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
<14-5,Chandler>有一个救生员正要拆除核弹
<14-5,Chandler>One of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.

335
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,440
<14-6,Monica>我们待会可以去喝一杯
<14-6,Monica>If you want to get a drink later, we can.

336
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,050
<14-7,Chandler>听起来不错
<14-7,Chandler>Yeah, that sounds great.

337
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,220
<14-7,Chandler>还有  事情会...
<14-7,Chandler>Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...

338
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,190
<14-7,Chandler>我知道
<14-7,Chandler>I know.

339
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,130
<14-7,Chandler>谢了
<14-7,Chandler>Thanks.

340
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,440
<15-1,Ross>搞不好可以避免
<15-1,Ross>Maybe this wouldn't have happened

341
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,780
<15-1,Ross>要是我再温柔体贴一些  或是
<15-1,Ross>if I'd been more nurturing or...

342
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,560
<15-1,Ross>多注意她一点  或是我
<15-1,Ross>I'd paid more attention or I...

343
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,080
<15-1,Ross>有子宫
<15-1,Ross>had a uterus.

344

<14-2,Monica>-我真不敢相信  -我知道
<14-2,Monica>- I can't believe it. - I know.

345
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,170
<15-2,Phoebe>你不该受这种折磨  真的  罗斯
<15-2,Phoebe>No, you know, you don't deserve this. You don't, Ross.

<15-2,Phoebe>-你人这么好  -谢谢
<15-2,Phoebe>- You're really... You're so good. - Thanks.

<15-5,Ross>谢谢
<15-5,Ross>Thanks.

350
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,620
<15-5,Ross>过来
<15-5,Ross>Come here.

351
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,990
<15-6,Ross>等一下
<15-6,Ross>Wait, wait, wait.

352
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,870
<15-8,Phoebe>别管了
<15-8,Phoebe>It's okay.

353
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,290
<15-12,Ross>等一下  我的脚卡在球洞里了
<15-12,Ross>Wait, wait, wait! My foot is stuck in the pocket.

354
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,020
<15-13,Phoebe>什么
<15-13,Phoebe>What?

355
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,390
<15-14,Ross>我弄不出来
<15-14,Ross>I can't get it out.

356
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,510
<15-15,Phoebe>女生可不想听到这种话
<15-15,Phoebe>That's not something a girl wants to hear.

357
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,860
<15-16,Ross>你别逗我
<15-16,Ross>Come on, don't start.

358
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,520
<15-17,Phoebe>怎么了
<15-17,Phoebe>What?

359
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,210
<15-18,Ross>这些烂球好碍事
<15-18,Ross>Stupid balls are in the way.

360
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,130
<15-19,Ross>好吧
<15-19,Ross>Oh, well.

361
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,720
<15-19,Ross>这不是最有建设性的解决方式
<15-19,Ross>That probably wouldn't have been the most constructive solution.

362
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,360
<15-20,Phoebe>你的脸上有粉笔灰
<15-20,Phoebe>You have chalk on your face.

363
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,650
<15-21,Ross>罗斯  你说得对
<15-21,Ross>Ross, you're right.

364
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,770
<15-22,Phoebe>我怎么会以为这是真的草皮呢
<15-22,Phoebe>I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.

365
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,920
<15-23,Monica>亲爱的  你还好吗
<15-23,Monica>Honey, you okay?

366
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,140
<15-24,Ross>我老婆是同性恋
<15-24,Ross>My wife's a lesbian.

367
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,370
<15-25,Joey>酷
<15-25,Joey>Cool!

368
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,900
<15-26,Chandler>罗斯  乔伊  乔伊  罗斯
<15-26,Chandler>Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

369
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,510
<16-1,Chandler>不敢相信你竟然回来了
<16-1,Chandler>I can't believe you came back.

370
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,070
<16-2,Rachel>什么都不要说
<16-2,Rachel>Don't say anything.

371
