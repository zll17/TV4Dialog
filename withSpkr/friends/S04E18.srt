00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,350
<1-2,Chandler>俗话说得没错

<1-2,Chandler>怀胎三月肚如鼓
<1-2,Chandler>Pregnant bellies look like a drum.

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,440
<1-3,Phoebe>我肚子大得已经挎不上吉他了
<1-3,Phoebe>I'm so pregnant that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,740
<1-3,Phoebe>所以我打算在生产前
<1-3,Phoebe>So I thought till I'm not,

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,880
<1-3,Phoebe>就用这个鼓来伴奏
<1-3,Phoebe>I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum.

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,670
<1-3,Phoebe>听起来超酷的

00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,660
<1-10,Alice>我得麻烦你帮我个大忙
<1-10,Alice>Actually, I came down to ask you a big favor.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,090
<1-11,Phoebe>别告诉我你还想往我子宫里塞东西
<1-11,Phoebe>Don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,890
<1-11,Phoebe>不  不会的
<1-11,Phoebe>No, no, no.

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,500
<1-12,Alice>是这样的
<1-12,Alice>Okay. Now, see.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,750
<1-12,Alice>我想给女孩取名莱丝莉
<1-12,Alice>I want to name the girl baby Leslie.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,130
<1-12,Alice>弗兰克想给其中一个男孩取名
<1-12,Alice>And Frank wants to name one of the boy babies

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,320
<1-12,Alice>弗兰克二世二世
<1-12,Alice>Frank Jr., Jr..

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,170
<1-13,Chandler>不应该是弗兰克三世吗
<1-13,Chandler>Wouldn't that be Frank III?

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,560
<1-14,Alice>一提这个我就来气
<1-14,Alice>Don't get me started.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,310
<1-14,Alice>既然有三个宝宝
<1-14,Alice>Anyway, since there are three babies

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,770
<1-14,Alice>我们又一人取了一个名字
<1-14,Alice>and we both got to put our names in

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,420
<1-14,Alice>如果你能给另一个男孩起名的话
<1-14,Alice>we would be truly honored

26
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,670
<1-14,Alice>我们会倍感荣幸
<1-14,Alice>if you would name the other boy baby.

27
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,640
<1-14,Alice>那太好了

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,240
<1-16,Alice>你先慢慢想
<1-16,Alice>Think about it.

45
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,760
<2-1,Emily>我有件胸罩晾在浴帘杆上了
<2-1,Emily>I left a bra drying on the shower rod.

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,370
<2-1,Emily>你不会觉得你儿子会认为是你的
<2-1,Emily>You don't think your son would think it's yours

47
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,940
<2-1,Emily>而心灵受创吧
<2-1,Emily>and be horribly traumatized?

48
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,000
<2-2,Ross>当妈的都能有老婆  当爹的就可以戴文胸
<2-2,Ross>Mommy can have a wife. Daddy can have a bra.

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,730
<2-3,Emily>该走了
<2-3,Emily>It's time to go.

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,290
<2-4,Ross>不  那个钟有点快
<2-4,Ross>Oh, no no no. See, that clock's a little fast.

<2-4,Ross>What can we do in 17 minutes...

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,600
<2-4,Ross>还能做两次
<2-4,Ross>...twice?

54
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,350
<2-5,Emily>你真有野心
<2-5,Emily>Well, that's ambitious.

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,360
<2-6,Ross>别理它
<2-6,Ross>You can ignore that.

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,990
<2-7,Emily>是卡罗尔带你儿子来了
<2-7,Emily>That's Carol with your son.

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,910
<2-21,Susan>他没事的
<2-21,Susan>It's fine, it's fine.

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,230
<2-21,Susan>他不喜欢我们处得来
<2-21,Susan>It's just us getting along is difficult for him,

74
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,910
<2-21,Susan>因为他不喜欢我
<2-21,Susan>because he doesn't like me.

75
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,520
<2-22,Ross>得了吧  其实...
<2-22,Ross>Come on. That's...

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,770
<2-22,Ross>没错
<2-22,Ross>It's true.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,430
<3-3,Chandler>名字想好了吗
<3-3,Chandler>Do we have a baby name yet?

78
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,700
<3-4,Phoebe>还没  太难了
<3-4,Phoebe>No. It's so hard!

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,900
<3-4,Phoebe>翻完这本书也没找着个好的
<3-4,Phoebe>I went through this book and found nothing.

80
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,980
<3-4,Phoebe>我想取个威猛而自信的名字
<3-4,Phoebe>I want a name that's really like, you know, strong and confident.

81
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,750
<3-4,Phoebe>比如  埃克森
<3-4,Phoebe>You know? Like... Exxon!

83
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,970
<3-5,Chandler>它旗下的瓦尔迪兹号可真威猛
<3-5,Chandler>It certainly worked for that Valdez kid.

84
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,580
<3-6,Joey>你要起个威猛的名字吗
<3-6,Joey>You want a strong name?

85
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,220
<3-6,Joey>"一只绿巨人"如何
<3-6,Joey>How about The Hulk?

86
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,770
<3-7,Phoebe>绿巨人我不敢说
<3-7,Phoebe>I'm not sure about Hulk,

87
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,140
<3-7,Phoebe>不过我喜欢以"一只"开头的
<3-7,Phoebe>but I like a name starting with "The".

88
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,990
<3-8,Joey>想取好名就取乔伊
<3-8,Joey>You want a good name, go with Joey.

89
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,550
<3-8,Joey>乔伊是你的好朋友  乔伊是你的好兄弟
<3-8,Joey>Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.

90
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,820
<3-8,Joey>人都在哪里  都在跟乔伊在一起
<3-8,Joey>Where is everybody? They're hanging out with Joey!

91
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,480
<3-8,Joey>嘿  如果要这样
<3-8,Joey>Hey, if you are going to do that.

92
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,640
<3-9,Chandler>取乔伊还不如叫钱德勒
<3-9,Chandler>If you're going to name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.

93
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,800
<3-9,Chandler>钱德勒既风趣又深刻还很可爱
<3-9,Chandler>Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and very lovable

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,660
<3-9,Chandler>如果你了解他
<3-9,Chandler>once you get to know him.

95
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,830
<3-9,Chandler>乔伊也很可爱
<3-9,Chandler>Joey's lovable too.

96
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,400
<3-10,Joey>重要的是  当你需要乔伊  他就会出现
<3-10,Joey>But the thing with Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.

97
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,090
<3-11,Chandler>钱德勒也会出现
<3-11,Chandler>Chandler will be there for you too.

98
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,630
<3-11,Chandler>他可能有点慢
<3-11,Chandler>I mean, he might be a little late

99
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,980
<3-11,Chandler>不过他一定会出现  他还会带冰汽水来
<3-11,Chandler>but he'll be there. And he'll bring you cold soda

100
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,670
<3-11,Chandler>如果你找他是因为你热得发烫
<3-11,Chandler>if what you need him for is that you're really hot.

101
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,380
<3-12,Joey>你怎么想
<3-12,Joey>What do you say?

102
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,380
<3-13,Phoebe>跟我爱的人同名的想法很好
<3-13,Phoebe>I like the idea of naming him after someone I love.

103
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,490
<3-13,Phoebe>乔伊和钱德勒都是很棒的名字
<3-13,Phoebe>Joey and Chandler are both great names.

104
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,980
<3-13,Phoebe>但是我不...
<3-13,Phoebe>All right, I don't...

105
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,150
<3-13,Phoebe>不如就叫"一只绿巨人"好了
<3-13,Phoebe>Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.

106
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,980
<3-14,Joey>真不该提
<3-14,Joey>I shouldn't have mentioned it.

107
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,760
<3-14,Joey>那是我留给我孩子的
<3-14,Joey>That's what I wanted to name my kid that.

108
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,210
<4-1,Rachel>如果第一次跟约书亚上床的话
<4-1,Rachel>If you were hoping to sleep with Joshua for the first time,

109
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,810
<4-1,Rachel>你会穿哪一件
<4-1,Rachel>which one would you wanna be wearing?

110
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,400
<4-2,Monica>帮别人挑性感内衣的事我做不来
<4-2,Monica>It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,060
<4-2,Monica>对不起  我太兴奋了
<4-2,Monica>I'm sorry. I'm just so excited.

112
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,540
<4-3,Rachel>这事我等了好几个月了  跑去染了发
<4-3,Rachel>I've been waiting for this for months. I got my hair colored.

113
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,830
<4-3,Rachel>换了新床单  还要给他做大餐
<4-3,Rachel>I got new sheets. I'm making him a very fancy meal.

114
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,600
<4-5,Rachel>我要给他做什么菜来着
<4-5,Rachel>What am I making him, by the way?

115
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,900
<4-5,Rachel>你打算给他做
<4-5,Rachel>Well, you are making him

116
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,680
<4-6,Monica>松子山羊奶酪菊苣沙拉
<4-6,Monica>a frisee salad with goat cheese and pine nuts

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
<4-6,Monica>菰米饭  烤芦笋和酥皮鲑鱼
<4-6,Monica>wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon en croute.

118
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,090
<4-7,Rachel>我以为是要做菲力牛排
<4-7,Rachel>I thought I was making him filet mignon.

119
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,970
<4-8,Monica>对  可后来你决定做鲑鱼
<4-8,Monica>Yes, you were, but then you decided to make salmon

120
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,660
<4-8,Monica>因为餐厅的鲑鱼有剩
<4-8,Monica>because you had some left over at the restaurant.

121
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,050
<4-8,Monica>然后你要知道要是你抱怨
<4-8,Monica>Then you realized if you bitched about it,

122
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,160
<4-8,Monica>你姐就会罢煮
<4-8,Monica>then you would stop cooking

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,310
<4-8,Monica>你就得上可乐烤土豆
<4-8,Monica>and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

124
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,040
<4-9,Rachel>我姐煮菜时火气真大
<4-9,Rachel>I really get crabby when I cook.

125
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,650
<5-4,Ross>艾蜜莉昨晚打电话来
<5-4,Ross>So Emily called last night.

126
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,640
<5-5,Chandler>你现在才转告我
<5-5,Chandler>And now you're giving me the message?

127
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,650
<5-6,Ross>艾蜜莉爱死苏珊了
<5-6,Ross>Turns out that Emily is just crazy about Susan.

128
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,540
<5-6,Ross>她们一起去看戏
<5-6,Ross>They're going to the theater together.

129
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,080
<5-6,Ross>她们一起吃晚饭
<5-6,Ross>They're going to dinner.

130
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,250
<5-6,Ross>她们还一起去骑马
<5-6,Ross>They're going horseback riding!

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,290
<5-7,Phoebe>苏珊真会玩
<5-7,Phoebe>God, Susan is so fun!

132
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,890
<5-8,Ross>这个情节太熟悉了一点
<5-8,Ross>Look, this is just a little too familiar.

133
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,750
<5-8,Ross>我和卡罗尔分手前半年
<5-8,Ross>For six months before Carol and I split up,

134
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,730
<5-8,Ross>我听到的只有"我朋友苏珊好聪明"
<5-8,Ross>all I heard was, "My friend Susan is so smart.

135
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,560
<5-8,Ross>"我朋友苏珊好风趣"
<5-8,Ross>My friend Susan is so funny.

136
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
<5-8,Ross>"我朋友苏珊好棒"
<5-8,Ross>My friend Susan is so great."

137
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,180
<5-9,Chandler>你担心艾蜜莉和苏珊会擦出火花吗
<5-9,Chandler>You actually think something could happen between Emily and Susan?

138
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,550
<5-10,Ross>她们都一起去健身房了
<5-10,Ross>Hey, they're going to the gym together!

139
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,050
<5-10,Ross>两个女人...
<5-10,Ross>Two women...

140
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,790
<5-10,Ross>劈腿拉筋
<5-10,Ross>...stretching!

141
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,190
<5-10,Ross>健身完洗个桑拿  然后就该互相调戏了
<5-10,Ross>They take a steam, things get playful.

142
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,830
<5-10,Ross>你们没看过《登峰造极》吗
<5-10,Ross>Did't you see Personal Best?

143
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,180
<5-11,Joey>没  但我一定要看
<5-11,Joey>No, but I'm gonna!

144
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,810
<5-12,Chandler>先生  您疯了
<5-12,Chandler>Hi! You're crazy.

145
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,790
<5-12,Chandler>那可是艾蜜莉  艾蜜莉是直女
<5-12,Chandler>This is Emily. Emily is straight.

146
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,640
<5-13,Ross>你怎么知道
<5-13,Ross>How do you know?

147
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,940
<5-13,Ross>我和卡罗尔结婚前也以为她是直女
<5-13,Ross>We thought Carol was straight before I married her.

148
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,530
<5-14,Phoebe>我肯定不喜欢罗斯这个名字
<5-14,Phoebe>Yeah, definitely. I don't like the name Ross.

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,740
<5-15,Ross>你落井下石的方式还真怪
<5-15,Ross>What a weird way to kick me when I'm down!

150
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,600
<5-16,Phoebe>不  我是说宝宝的名字
<5-16,Phoebe>No, no, I meant for the baby.

151
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,930
<5-17,Ross>罗斯这名字有什么不好
<5-17,Ross>What's wrong with Ross?

152
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,770
<5-18,Phoebe>绿巨人就不会遇上这种事
<5-18,Phoebe>Something like this would never happen to The Hulk, you know.

153
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,020
<5-19,Ross>其实  也并非如此
<5-19,Ross>Actually, that's not true.

154
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,040
<5-19,Ross>《无敌绿巨人》72话  布鲁斯·班纳博士发现...
<5-19,Ross>In The Incredible Hulk, number 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found...

155
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,890
<5-19,Ross>那个...
<5-19,Ross>You know...

156
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,270
<5-20,Phoebe>算了  我女朋友都成拉拉了
<5-20,Phoebe>Never mind. My girlfriend's a lesbian.

157
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,810
<5-20,Phoebe>我决定从乔伊和钱德勒里二选一
<5-20,Phoebe>So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.

158
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,910
<5-21,Joey>你一定要选乔伊
<5-21,Joey>You gotta pick Joey!

159
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,230
<5-21,Joey>有哪个名人叫钱德勒
<5-21,Joey>Name one famous person named Chandler.

160
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,820
<5-22,Chandler>雷蒙·钱德勒
<5-22,Chandler>Raymond Chandler.

162
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,280
<5-23,Joey>你捏造的人不算
<5-23,Joey>Someone you didn't make up.

163
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,830
<5-24,Chandler>叫乔伊的才没有名人呢  除了
<5-24,Chandler>There are no famous Joeys. Except for...

164
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,520
<5-24,Chandler>乔伊·巴塔弗柯
<5-24,Chandler>...Joey Buttafuoco.

166
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,080
<5-25,Joey>他的确是我们的心头之痛
<5-25,Joey>Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

167
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,470
<5-26,Phoebe>折中一下如何  比如...
<5-26,Phoebe>How about a compromise then? What if it's...

168
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,510
<5-26,Phoebe>钱诺伊
<5-26,Phoebe>...Chan-no-ey?

169
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,300
<5-27,Chandler>乔伊  你好好想想
<5-27,Chandler>Joey? Think about it.

170
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,350
<5-27,Chandler>首先  他绝对当不上总统
<5-27,Chandler>First of all, he'll never be president.

171
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,890
<5-27,Chandler>绝对不会出现乔伊总统
<5-27,Chandler>There will never be a President Joey.

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,380
<5-28,Joey>听着  我本来不想提的
<5-28,Joey>Alright, look man. I didn't want to bring this up.

173
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,170
<5-28,Joey>但钱德勒是我听过最蠢的名字
<5-28,Joey>But Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life!

174
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,790
<5-28,Joey>它根本不是名字  连个词都不是
<5-28,Joey>It's not a name! It's barely even a word.

175
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,610
<5-28,Joey>念着像"前吊灯"但又不是
<5-28,Joey>It's like chandelier but it's not!

176
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,320
<5-28,Joey>它是个蠢到爆的非名字
<5-28,Joey>It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!

177
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,050
<5-29,Chandler>你说得对  我的名字烂透了
<5-29,Chandler>You're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.

178
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,290
<5-30,Joey>对不起  我不是...对不起
<5-30,Joey>I'm sorry, man. I didn't, I'm sorry.

179
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,290
<5-31,Chandler>没事
<5-31,Chandler>It's okay.

180
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,620
<5-32,Joey>所以就是乔伊喽
<5-32,Joey>So I guess it's Joey then. I mean.

181
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,130
<6-1,Joshua>好丰盛  谢谢你这么费心
<6-1,Joshua>This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.

182
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,920
<6-2,Rachel>别客气  烹饪能给我以安慰
<6-2,Rachel>Please! Cooking soothes me.

183
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,180
<6-2,Rachel>我们开吃吧
<6-2,Rachel>So dig in!

184
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,610
<6-3,Joshua>看起来都好好吃
<6-3,Joshua>It all looks so good.

185
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,820
<6-5,Joshua>老天
<6-5,Joshua>Oh, my God.

186
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
<6-6,Rachel>我知道  天呐  这个米饭好...
<6-6,Rachel>I know. My God, this rice is so...

187
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,610
<6-6,Rachel>我的手艺真好
<6-6,Rachel>I am so good!

188
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,830
<6-7,Joshua>你后面
<6-7,Joshua>Behind you.

189
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,680
<6-8,Rachel>没事  它们以前住这里  有时会迁徒回来
<6-8,Rachel>They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.

190
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,290
<6-9,Joshua>能不能让它们不要在这里
<6-9,Joshua>Is there some way that they could not be here?

191
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,700
<6-9,Joshua>我最怕家禽了
<6-9,Joshua>Farm birds really kind of freak me out!

192
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,550
<6-10,Rachel>-好  -出去
<6-10,Rachel>- Okay, okay. - Here we go.

193
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,010
<6-10,Rachel>出去
<6-10,Rachel>There you go!

194
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,550
<6-11,Joey>你们怎么学会敲门的  进来
<6-11,Joey>Hey! How'd you do that?  Come in.

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,060
<6-12,Rachel>都走了
<6-12,Rachel>All gone.

196
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,490
<6-12,Rachel>怕家禽是吧
<6-12,Rachel>So, farm birds, huh?

197
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,590
<6-13,Joshua>这是我唯一的怪毛病  我发誓
<6-13,Joshua>It's my only weird thing, I swear.

198
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,900
<6-13,Joshua>我想告诉你的  但我没想到它们会在这里
<6-13,Joshua>I would have told you. But I didn't know that they'd be here.

199
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,790
<6-14,Rachel>要不要来点...
<6-14,Rachel>Can I serve you a little...

200
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,790
<6-16,Rachel>怎么了
<6-16,Rachel>What?

201
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,500
<6-17,Joshua>没事
<6-17,Joshua>Nothing.

202
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,260
<6-17,Joshua>只是我还能感觉到它们的存在
<6-17,Joshua>It's just that I know that they're still out there.

203
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,790
<6-18,Rachel>它们在对门  隔着两道墙
<6-18,Rachel>They're across the hall. That's two doors away.

204
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,660
<6-18,Rachel>它们得啄很久才能把墙啄穿
<6-18,Rachel>It'll take them a long time to peck their way back over here.

205
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,250
<6-19,Joshua>我笑不出来
<6-19,Joshua>That's not funny.

206
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,920
<6-20,Rachel>那换个地方会不会好点
<6-20,Rachel>Would you feel better if we went someplace else?

207
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,140
<6-20,Rachel>我们可以把东西打包去你家
<6-20,Rachel>We could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment.

208
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,060
<6-21,Joshua>这周我家在装修  一团混乱
<6-21,Joshua>They're working on it this week. It's a total mess.

209
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,140
<6-21,Joshua>我暂住我父母家  咱们可以去那里
<6-21,Joshua>I'm staying at my parents' house. We could go there.

210
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
<6-22,Rachel>-你父母  -他们出游了
<6-22,Rachel>- Your parents? - They're out of town.

211
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,050
<6-24,Rachel>那里地方很大  后院很美
<6-24,Rachel>It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view in the park.

212
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,560
<6-25,Joshua>会很浪漫的
<6-25,Joshua>It'd be very romantic.

213
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,330
<6-26,Rachel>-如何  -好啊
<6-26,Rachel>- What do you say? - Yeah, that works.

214
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,450
<6-27,Joshua>它们闻得出恐惧
<6-27,Joshua>They can smell the fear.

215
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,760
<7-2,Carol>本好吗
<7-2,Carol>How's Ben?

216
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,410
<7-3,Ross>我问他要不要吃东西  他说不要
<7-3,Ross>I asked if he wanted to eat. He said no.

217
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,900
<7-3,Ross>我问他要不要睡觉  他说不要
<7-3,Ross>I asked if he wanted to sleep. He said no.

218
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,100
<7-3,Ross>我问他想做什么  他说不要
<7-3,Ross>I asked what he wanted to do. He said no.

219
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,560
<7-3,Ross>所以他在扫地
<7-3,Ross>So he's sweeping.

220
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,660
<7-5,Ross>有苏珊的消息吗
<7-5,Ross>Any word from Susan?

221
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,980
<7-6,Carol>她说她跟艾蜜莉玩得很开心
<7-6,Carol>She said she's having so much fun with Emily.

222
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,110
<7-7,Ross>对了  你有没有想过
<7-7,Ross>By the by, did it ever occur to you that

223
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,590
<7-7,Ross>她们或许太开心了一点
<7-7,Ross>maybe they might be having a little too much fun?

224
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,980
<7-8,Carol>什么叫太开心
<7-8,Carol>What's too much fun?

225
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,500
<7-9,Ross>我们是夫妻时你和苏珊的那种开心
<7-9,Ross>The kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.

226
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,130
<7-10,Carol>天呐  你真会乱想
<7-10,Carol>Oh, my God! You are so paranoid.

227
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,950
<7-11,Ross>-是吗  -是
<7-11,Ross>- Am I? - Yes.

228
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,010
<7-11,Ross>是吗
<7-11,Ross>Am I?

229
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,250
<7-13,Ross>我不知道艾蜜莉
<7-13,Ross>I can't speak for Emily.

230
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,170
<7-14,Carol>但苏珊和我的关系很稳定
<7-14,Carol>But Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.

231
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,280
<7-15,Ross>卡罗尔  我们曾经也是
<7-15,Ross>Carol, so were we.

232
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,070
<7-15,Ross>你就想像一下
<7-15,Ross>Just imagine for a moment

233
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,650
<7-15,Ross>苏珊认识了别人然后她们一拍即合
<7-15,Ross>that Susan meets someone, and they hit it off.

234
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,170
<7-15,Ross>她们从剧院回来
<7-15,Ross>They're coming back from the theater,

235
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,680
<7-15,Ross>去酒吧喝个小酒
<7-15,Ross>and they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks.

236
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,750
<7-15,Ross>有说有笑
<7-15,Ross>They're laughing.

237
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,380
<7-15,Ross>其中一个不小心碰了下另一个
<7-15,Ross>Someone innocently touches someone else.

238
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,960
<7-15,Ross>一碰就擦出了火花
<7-15,Ross>There's electricity.

239
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,180
<7-15,Ross>感觉很新鲜  很刺激
<7-15,Ross>It's new. It's exciting.

240
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,840
<7-15,Ross>你敢说完全没有可能
<7-15,Ross>Are you saying there isn't the slightest possibility

241
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,940
<7-15,Ross>出点什么事
<7-15,Ross>of something happening?

242
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,060
<7-16,Carol>-或许吧  -天呐
<7-16,Carol>- Maybe. - Oh, my God!

243
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,330
<7-17,Ross>听你一说我彻底绝望了
<7-17,Ross>I didn't really believe it until you just said it!

244
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,210
<8-1,Joshua>别的小朋友都不信
<8-1,Joshua>Even though none of the other kids believed me,

245
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,520
<8-1,Joshua>但那只鸭子真的推了我
<8-1,Joshua>I swear to God that duck pushed me.

246
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,500
<8-2,Rachel>这里真豪华
<8-2,Rachel>This place is fabulous!

247
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,870
<8-3,Joshua>我带你走走
<8-3,Joshua>Let me show you around.

248
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,390
<8-3,Joshua>这是楼下的客厅
<8-3,Joshua>This is the downstairs living room.

249
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,990
<8-4,Rachel>居然有两个客厅
<8-4,Rachel>There's two living rooms?

250
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,700
<8-4,Rachel>你从小在这长大
<8-4,Rachel>Growing up here,

251
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,170
<8-4,Rachel>肯定帮你引来不少妹子吧
<8-4,Rachel>this place must have been a real babe magnet.

252
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,010
<8-5,Joshua>本来是的  但我父母刚搬来
<8-5,Joshua>It would have been, but my parents just moved here.

253
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,450
<8-6,Rachel>这地方能帮你引来很多妹子的
<8-6,Rachel>You should know this place is a real babe magnet.

254

256
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,660
<8-7,Joshua>我们待会再吃
<8-7,Joshua>and we can eat it later?

257
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,030
<8-8,Rachel>听起来不错
<8-8,Rachel>That sounds like a plan.

258
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,420
<8-8,Rachel>哪里可以让我梳洗一下
<8-8,Rachel>Is there a place that I could go freshen up?

<9-6,Rachel>什么  这...不  你们误会了
<9-6,Rachel>What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.

275
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,560
<9-6,Rachel>我在时装界工作
<9-6,Rachel>Okay, I work in fashion.

276
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,740
<9-6,Rachel>这其实是正式的着装
<9-6,Rachel>And this is a real dress, actually.

277
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,840
<9-6,Rachel>在米兰满街都是穿这个的
<9-6,Rachel>They're wearing it in Milan.

278

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,910
<9-6,Rachel>观察大众的反应
<9-6,Rachel>and see how people respond.

280
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,080
<9-6,Rachel>然后回报给布明岱尔百货的上司
<9-6,Rachel>Then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's.

281
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,700
<9-6,Rachel>很显然  这个情况
<9-6,Rachel>Obviously, in this case

282
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,840
<9-6,Rachel>我得汇报说
<9-6,Rachel>I am going to report back:

<9-6,Rachel>美国  暂不适合
<9-6,Rachel>"U.S.A. Not ready."

284
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,890
<9-7,Mrs. Burgin>洛杉矶或许可以

285
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,700
<9-9,Joshua>-对  -有道理
<9-9,Joshua>- Yes  - There you go!

<9-11,Rachel>我们想完事儿再吃...我是说  正要吃
<9-11,Rachel>We were going to do that after. I mean, next.

288
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,340
<9-11,Rachel>我们饿死了
<9-11,Rachel>We were starving .

289
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,720
<9-12,Mr. Burgin>大家一起出去吃吧
<9-12,Mr. Burgin>Why don't we all get something to eat?

290
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,090
<9-13,Rachel>也好  穿着它窝在家里太可惜了
<9-13,Rachel>No use wasting this baby just lying around the house.

291
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,830
<9-14,Mr. Burgin>所以我们去吃饭
<9-14,Mr. Burgin>So we'll go eat.

292
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,610
<9-15,Rachel>你就穿那样

<9-16,Mr. Burgin>我们吃着饭  你还是穿成那样
<9-16,Mr. Burgin>We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.

00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,160
<10-1,Joey>我为我说的话道歉
<10-1,Joey>I am sorry about what I said.

295
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,280
<10-2,Chandler>不  你说得对  这个名字太可笑了
<10-2,Chandler>Nope, you're right. It is a ridiculous name!

296
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,090
<10-3,Joey>也没那么糟
<10-3,Joey>It's not bad.

297
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,010
<10-4,Chandler>当然有

<11-2,Rachel>And the best part was when the waiter spilled water down my back.

315
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,010
<11-2,Rachel>我一跳  奶子弹了出来
<11-2,Rachel>I jumped up and my boob popped out.

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,480
<11-8,Ross>苏珊是同志
<11-8,Ross>Susan's gay.

323
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,930
<11-8,Ross>她们要"天下大同"了
<11-8,Ross>They're being gay together!

324
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
<11-9,Monica>艾蜜莉是直女
<11-9,Monica>Emily's straight.

<11-10,Ross>你醒醒吧
<11-10,Ross>Oh, wake up!

326

<11-11,Phoebe>卡罗尔真的把你害惨了
<11-11,Phoebe>Wow! Carol really messed you up.

327
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,570
<11-12,Ross>你说什么
<11-12,Ross>Excuse me?

328
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,460
<11-13,Phoebe>她害你变成了个多疑  猜忌  爱吃飞醋的
<11-13,Phoebe>She turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous...

329
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,640
<11-13,Phoebe>马屁精
<11-13,Phoebe>sycophant!

330
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,810
<11-13,Phoebe>我不知道"马屁精"是什么意思
<11-13,Phoebe>So I don't know what "sycophant" means,

331
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,930
<11-13,Phoebe>不过剩下的都说对了
<11-13,Phoebe>but the rest is right.

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
<11-13,Phoebe>你们都在胡说什么
<11-13,Phoebe>What are you talking about?

333
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,930
<11-14,Ross>我才没有吃醋上瘾呢
<11-14,Ross>I am not a crazy, jealous person.

334
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,150
<11-16,Ross>怎么了
<11-16,Ross>What?

335
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,350
<11-17,Rachel>她说得没错
<11-17,Rachel>She's totally right.

336
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,540
<11-17,Rachel>我们在一起时  你老吃马克的醋
<11-17,Rachel>When we were together, you got all freak out about Mark,

337
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,830
<11-17,Rachel>其实我俩什么都没有
<11-17,Rachel>and there was nothing.

338
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,260
<11-18,Monica>太有道理了
<11-18,Monica>This totally makes sense.

339
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,230
<11-19,Ross>根本乱讲
<11-19,Ross>It does not!

340
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,060
<11-19,Ross>太说得通了
<11-19,Ross>Sure it does.

341
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,800
<11-20,Monica>高中时你从不吃醋
<11-20,Monica>In high school, you were not jealous at all...

342
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,700
<11-20,Monica>尽管你每个女友都劈腿
<11-20,Monica>even though all your girlfriends cheated on you.

343
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,730
<11-21,Phoebe>一直到92  93年他都很信任别人
<11-21,Phoebe>So up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.

344
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,010
<11-21,Phoebe>然后94年来袭  卡罗尔离开他
<11-21,Phoebe>Then '94 hit, Carol left him,

345
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,720
<11-21,Phoebe>一下就变得捕风捉影
<11-21,Phoebe>and bam! Paranoid City!

346
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,630
<11-22,Rachel>就是这样  一点没错
<11-22,Rachel>Absolutely! Absolutely!

347
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,930
<11-23,Monica>太好玩了
<11-23,Monica>This is so much fun!

348
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,190
<11-24,Ross>一点也不好玩
<11-24,Ross>This is not fun!

349
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,010
<11-25,Monica>听着  我们只想说
<11-25,Monica>Look, all we're trying to say is

350
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,780
<11-25,Monica>别让你和卡罗尔的悲剧
<11-25,Monica>don't let what happened with Carol

351
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,430
<11-25,Monica>影响你和艾蜜莉的感情
<11-25,Monica>ruin what you've got with Emily.

352
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,480
<11-26,Phoebe>92年的罗斯就不会
<11-26,Phoebe>The '92 Ross wouldn't.

353
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,400
<11-27,Ross>我还是觉得马克一定不老实
<11-27,Ross>I still think I was right about that Mark thing.

354
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,720
<11-27,Ross>什么  你知道吗
<11-27,Ross>Wh-What, you know what?

355
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,470
<11-28,Rachel>我希望艾蜜莉就是拉拉
<11-28,Rachel>I hope Emily is a lesbian.

356
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
<11-28,Rachel>划鼓
<11-28,Rachel>Drumroll.

357
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,790
<12-2,Chandler>好了
<12-2,Chandler>Okay, okay, all right.

358
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,520
<12-2,Chandler>帮个忙
<12-2,Chandler>Help!

359
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,460
<12-2,Chandler>我适合马克还是约翰
<12-2,Chandler>Am I a Mark or a John?

360
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,780
<12-3,Joey>你当马克不够高
<12-3,Joey>You're not tall enough to be a Mark.

361
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,150
<12-3,Joey>不过你或许能当个好巴尼
<12-3,Joey>But you might make a good Barney.

362
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,970
<12-3,Joey>我是认真的
<12-3,Joey>Look, I am serious.

363
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,480
<12-4,Chandler>明天3点半我就要上法院
<12-4,Chandler>Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going down to the courthouse.

364
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,490
<12-5,Phoebe>你真的要改名
<12-5,Phoebe>You're actually going through with this?

365
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,980
<12-6,Chandler>这个名字拖累了我一辈子
<12-6,Chandler>This name has been holding me back my entire life.

366
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,140
<12-6,Chandler>害我被其他同学找茬
<12-6,Chandler>It's probably why kids picked on me in school

367
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,070
<12-6,Chandler>害我没有桃花运
<12-6,Chandler>and why I never do well with women.

368
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,760
<12-6,Chandler>明天4点起
<12-6,Chandler>So at 4 o'clock tomorrow,

369
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,750
<12-6,Chandler>我不是马克·约翰森就是约翰·马克森
<12-6,Chandler>I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.

370
