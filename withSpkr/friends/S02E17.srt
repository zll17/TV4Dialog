00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,010
<1-12,JOEY>为什么钱德勒没来
<1-12,JOEY>How come Chandler didn't come?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,380

<3-5,MONICA>我好像又回到十六岁了
<3-5,MONICA>It's like I'm sixteen all over again .

76
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,210
<3-6,RACHEL>你不是十六岁  而且你们现在都是大人了
<3-6,RACHEL>Well, you're not 16. You're both adults now.

102
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,000
<4-12,JOEY>好啊
<4-12,JOEY>Well OK then.

103
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,540
<4-12,JOEY>是烤箱定时器响吗
<4-12,JOEY>Was that the oven timer?

104
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,970

<4-14,BOTH>...Baywatch!

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,730
<4-15,JOEY>你相信他们让斯蒂芬妮得皮肤癌吗
<4-15,JOEY>Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,320
<4-16,CHANDLER>我还是不敢相信他们升她为副队长
<4-16,CHANDLER>I still can't believe they made her lieutenant!

109
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,730
<4-17,JOEY>你那么说是因为你最喜欢亚斯明·布里斯了
<4-17,JOEY>You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.

110
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,230
<4-18,CHANDLER>怎么可能会有人不爱亚斯明·布里斯
<4-18,CHANDLER>How could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth?

111
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,530
<4-19,JOEY>她们跑起来了
<4-19,JOEY>Hey, they're running.

112
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,610
<4-20,CHANDLER>瞧  这就是这出节目的精华
<4-20,CHANDLER>See, this is the brilliance of the show.

113
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,720
<4-20,CHANDLER>她们真应该不停地跑
<4-20,CHANDLER>I say always keep them running.

114
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,850
<4-20,CHANDLER>一个劲地跑
<4-20,CHANDLER>All the time running!

115
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,410
<4-20,CHANDLER>跑
<4-20,CHANDLER>Run!

116
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,740
<4-20,CHANDLER>跑
<4-20,CHANDLER>Run!

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,070
<4-20,CHANDLER>跑啊  亚斯明  飞奔吧
<4-20,CHANDLER>Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

118
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,970
<5-1,MONICA>我以为你想自己一个人住
<5-1,MONICA>But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.

119
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,220
<5-2,JOEY>没错  我以为会很棒
<5-2,JOEY>I did. I thought it'd be great.

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,110
<5-2,JOEY>我以为我会有时间自己思考
<5-2,JOEY>I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.

121
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,950
<5-2,JOEY>但我发觉我的思想没有你们那么多
<5-2,JOEY>But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you think.

122
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,210
<5-3,PHOEBE>乔伊  你索性跟钱德勒说你想搬回去好了
<5-3,PHOEBE>Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?

123
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
<5-4,JOEY>你认为他会答应吗
<5-4,JOEY>You really think he'd take me?

124
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,100
<5-4,JOEY>我们昨晚聊得很开心
<5-4,JOEY>We had a good talk last night...

125
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,770
<5-4,JOEY>可是我搬走时  把他伤透了
<5-4,JOEY>...but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.

126
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,790
<5-5,MONICA>我保证  他绝对想你搬回去的
<5-5,MONICA>I promise you, he would definitely want you back.

127
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
<6-1,ROSS>我告诉你  他绝对不可能搬回来的
<6-1,ROSS>I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,150
<6-2,CHANDLER>可我们从没像昨晚聊得那么开心过
<6-2,CHANDLER>But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.

129
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,440
<6-2,CHANDLER>就像
<6-2,CHANDLER>I mean, it was

130
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,270
<6-2,CHANDLER>我们刚住在一起时一样

302
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,590
<12-16,ROSS>我们只是在闹着玩而已
<12-16,ROSS>We're just having fun.

<12-18,ROSS>是啊  我以为我们只是在闹  就像小时候一样
<12-18,ROSS>Yeah, come on, I thought we were fooling around, like when we were kids.

305
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,380
<12-19,MONICA>罗斯  小时候我恨你

309
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,290
<12-21,MONICA>但从根本上讲  我恨透你了
<12-21,MONICA>... but basically, I hated your guts.

310
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,360
<12-22,ROSS>你为什么要恨我
<12-22,ROSS>Why did you hate me?

311
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,740
<12-23,MONICA>因为你对我太刻薄了
<12-23,MONICA>Because you were mean to me...

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,380
<12-24,ROSS>你觉得那不好玩
<12-24,ROSS>That wasn't fun for you?

<12-26,ROSS>真不敢相信你恨过我
<12-26,ROSS>I can't believe you hated me.

316
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,010
<12-27,MONICA>不只是因为我们有血缘关系
<12-27,MONICA>And not just because I have to.

<13-3,PHOEBE>那卷录像带上的歌声不是我的
<13-3,PHOEBE>...but that is not me singing on the video.

330
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,760
<13-7,PHOEBE>唱片公司送了一张纸条来  叫我签名  要我同意
<13-7,PHOEBE>O.K. The record company sent over this paper for me to sign saying it's okay...

331
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,650
<13-7,PHOEBE>他们找别人代唱  这是第一条线索
<13-7,PHOEBE>...for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.

332
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,740
<13-8,MONICA>那你打算怎么办
<13-8,MONICA>So what will you do?

333
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,420
<13-9,PHOEBE>我没办法跟这种人共事
<13-9,PHOEBE>I can't work with people who would do this.

334
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,470
<13-10,MONICA>当然
<13-10,MONICA>Sure.

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,920
<13-13,PHOEBE>那个代唱的女人
<13-13,PHOEBE>The voice woman.

338
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,970
<13-13,PHOEBE>她的声音很不错  可是她没能拍录像带
<13-13,PHOEBE>She has a great voice, but she doesn't have a video.

339
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,040
<13-14,RACHEL>菲比  那你呢

<13-15,PHOEBE>这个代唱的人她很有才华
<13-15,PHOEBE>This voice woman, she's so talented.

342
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,960
<13-15,PHOEBE>可是那些制片人说
<13-15,PHOEBE>But according to the producer people,

343
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:57,080
<13-15,PHOEBE>她长得不怎么样
<13-15,PHOEBE>they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know.

344
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,590
<13-15,PHOEBE>她就像那种动物收容所里面的动物
<13-15,PHOEBE>I mean, it's like, she's like one of those animals at the pound

345
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,630
<13-15,PHOEBE>没有人要  就因为她长得不够漂亮而已
<13-15,PHOEBE>...who nobody wants because they're not  pretty enough or you know.

346
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,060
<13-15,PHOEBE>或者是像只老狗  浑身发臭
<13-15,PHOEBE>Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and.
