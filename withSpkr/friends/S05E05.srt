1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,540
<10-15,Chandler>莫妮卡
<10-15,Chandler>Monica?

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,120
<1-3,Joey>现在几点
<1-3,Joey>What time is it?

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,820
<1-4,Chandler>九点
<1-4,Chandler>Nine.

4
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,560
<1-5,Joey>可是外面还很黑
<1-5,Joey>But it's dark out.

5
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,990
<1-6,Monica>那是因为你老睡到中午  傻瓜
<1-6,Monica>That's because you always sleep till noon, silly.

6
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,630
<1-6,Monica>九点就是这么黑
<1-6,Monica>This is what nine looks like.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,200
<1-7,Joey>那我该梳洗一下
<1-7,Joey>I guess I'll get washed up then.

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,300
<1-7,Joey>准备看日出
<1-7,Joey>Watch that sunrise.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,440
<1-8,Monica>我不想再偷偷摸摸了
<1-8,Monica>I'm getting tired of sneaking around.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,460
<1-8,Monica>我也是
<1-8,Monica>I know me too.

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,660
<1-9,Chandler>不如我们去外面度周末吧
<1-9,Chandler>Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,000
<1-9,Chandler>就没人打扰我们了
<1-9,Chandler>Y'know we'd have no interruptions

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,080
<1-9,Chandler>还可以整日脱得光光
<1-9,Chandler>and we could be naked the entire time.

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,690
<1-10,Monica>整个周末  那可有好多脱光光
<1-10,Monica>All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,390
<1-11,Chandler>我可以说我去开会
<1-11,Chandler>Yeah, I can say that I have a conference

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,260
<1-11,Chandler>你就说去参加厨师什么会
<1-11,Chandler>and you can say you have a chef thing.

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,770
<1-12,Monica>我一直想参加
<1-12,Monica>I've always wanted to go to

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,460
<1-12,Monica>新泽西的烹饪大会
<1-12,Monica>this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,790
<1-13,Chandler>很好  不过你去的不是那里
<1-13,Chandler>Okay. You know you're not, though.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,790
<1-13,Chandler>-走吧  -好  等等
<1-13,Chandler>- Let's go. - Okay. Wait.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,430
<1-14,Monica>乔伊怎么办
<1-14,Monica>What about Joey?

37
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,330
<2-1,Monica>知道我这周末要干嘛吗
<2-1,Monica>Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend!

38
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,410
<2-1,Monica>我要去新泽西参加烹饪大会
<2-1,Monica>I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,450
<2-2,Phoebe>奇怪  钱德勒刚说要去那里开会
<2-2,Phoebe>How weird! Chandler just said he's got a conference there.

40
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,100
<2-3,Monica>真有意思
<2-3,Monica>That's funny.

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,070
<2-3,Monica>钱德勒应该可以去
<2-3,Monica>Seems like Chandler's conference could've been...

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,000
<2-3,Monica>康涅狄格或佛蒙特州开会
<2-3,Monica>...in Connecticut or Vermont.

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,540
<2-4,Chandler>我又不能决定在哪里开会
<2-4,Chandler>I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,400
<2-4,Chandler>难道你希望大家认为我造假吗  我可没说慌
<2-4,Chandler>Do you want people to think it's fake? It's a real conference.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,370
<2-6,Joey>瑞秋在吗  我有话跟她说
<2-6,Joey>Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,950
<2-8,Ross>她出去逛街了
<2-8,Ross>No, she's out shopping.

47
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,110
<2-10,Ross>-可恶  -怎么了
<2-10,Ross>- Damn! - What's going on?

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,810
<2-12,Ross>我叫艾蜜莉来
<2-12,Ross>I told Emily to come.

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,310
<2-12,Ross>所以我得赶快跟瑞秋说
<2-12,Ross>And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,150
<2-13,Phoebe>等等
<2-13,Phoebe>Wait a minute.

51
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,620
<2-13,Phoebe>艾蜜莉来了之后  你真的就不再见瑞秋了吗
<2-13,Phoebe>When Emily comes, you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?

52
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,460
<2-14,Ross>我现在只能专心想着
<2-14,Ross>Well look, I'm just trying to focus on

53
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,250
<2-14,Ross>我可以见我老婆
<2-14,Ross>the "I get to see my wife," part, all right?

54
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,000
<2-14,Ross>不去想我快胃溃疡的事
<2-14,Ross>...and not on the part that makes me do this.

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,590
<2-15,Monica>你们再也不能共处一室了吗
<2-15,Monica>So you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?

56
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,530
<2-15,Monica>这怎么可能
<2-15,Monica>How is that even gonna work?

57
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,600
<2-16,Ross>我也不知道  我是说
<2-16,Ross>I have no idea. I mean...

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,870
<2-16,Ross>但我保证  我一定会想到办法
<2-16,Ross>But I assure you, I will figure it out.

59
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,540
<2-17,Joey>看起来实在不可能
<2-17,Joey>Doesn't seem like it's going to work.

60
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,910
<2-18,Rachel>嗨  大家好
<2-18,Rachel>Hi, guys.

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,510
<2-20,Chandler>怎么了
<2-20,Chandler>What's going on?

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,060
<2-21,Rachel>我们正要帮莫妮卡翻床垫
<2-21,Rachel>We're flipping Monica's mattress.

63
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,650
<2-23,Joey>我认为应该先抬起来再翻过来
<2-23,Joey>So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up and then we flip it.

64
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,300
<2-24,Phoebe>这方法比我的主意好
<2-24,Phoebe>That's better than my way.

65
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,570
<2-25,Rachel>你们要不要顺便帮我翻下
<2-25,Rachel>Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?

66
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,410
<2-26,Chandler>受不了
<2-26,Chandler>Oh, man.

67
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,250
<2-27,Rachel>看啊  我妈寄信来了
<2-27,Rachel>Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,980
<2-28,Ross>瑞秋
<2-28,Ross>So, Rach?

69
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,110
<2-28,Ross>你知道艾蜜莉要来  对吗
<2-28,Ross>You know how Emily's coming, right?

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,950
<2-29,Rachel>是  我知道啊
<2-29,Rachel>Oh, yeah. I know.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,790
<3-1,Phoebe>听得到吗
<3-1,Phoebe>Can you hear anything?

72
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,990
<3-2,Chandler>当然  刚刚有人说"听得到吗"
<3-2,Chandler>Yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"

73
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,090
<3-3,Monica>乔伊的大屁股
<3-3,Monica>Hey, Joey's ass.

74
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,570
<3-3,Monica>你在做什么
<3-3,Monica>What are you doing?

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,880
<3-4,Joey>记得上次他们吵架分手时
<3-4,Joey>Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up,

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,470
<3-4,Joey>我们困在房里没东西可吃吗
<3-4,Joey>...and we were stuck here all night with no food or anything?

77
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,830
<3-4,Joey>罗斯在婚礼上说出瑞秋的名字后
<3-4,Joey>When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,

78
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,040
<3-4,Joey>我猜旧戏可能会重演
<3-4,Joey>I figured it was gonna happen again.

79
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,310
<3-4,Joey>所以我在这里藏了这些东西
<3-4,Joey>So I hid this in here.

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,110
<3-5,Monica>有糖果  填字游戏
<3-5,Monica>Candy bars, crossword puzzles...

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,190
<3-6,Phoebe>疯狂字谜  我要
<3-6,Phoebe>Mad Libs! Mine!

82
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,210
<3-7,Chandler>保险套
<3-7,Chandler>Condoms?

83
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
<3-8,Joey>谁晓得会在这里待多久
<3-8,Joey>You don't know how long we'll be in here.

84
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,170
<3-8,Joey>搞不好我们还得负责繁衍人类后代
<3-8,Joey>We may have to repopulate the Earth.

85
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,690
<3-9,Chandler>戴保险套就是用来繁衍后代的
<3-9,Chandler>And condoms are the way to do that?

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,240
<4-1,Ross>总之  有个关键问题
<4-1,Ross>Anyway, it all boils down to this.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,710
<4-1,Ross>上次我跟艾蜜莉通电话
<4-1,Ross>The last time I talked to Emily...

88
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,930
<4-2,Rachel>天啊  我的狗死了
<4-2,Rachel>Oh, my God! My dog died!

89
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,430
<4-3,Ross>什么
<4-3,Ross>What?

90
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,390
<4-4,Rachel>我家的狗  拉普死了
<4-4,Rachel>Our dog! LaPooh!

91
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,030
<4-5,Ross>拉普还活着吗
<4-5,Ross>LaPooh's still alive?

92
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,850
<4-6,Rachel>我妈说它被冰激凌车撞到
<4-6,Rachel>It says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine...

93
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,210
<4-6,Rachel>还被拖了19条街
<4-6,Rachel>...teen blocks!

94
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,080
<4-7,Monica>-我的天啊  -亲爱的  我们听到你在哭
<4-7,Monica>- Oh, my God. - Sweetie, we heard you crying.

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,290
<4-7,Monica>-拜托别哭了  -拉普出事了
<4-7,Monica>- Please don't cry. - It's LaPooh!

96
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,940
<4-7,Monica>现在你为拉普难过  等下这就不算什么了
<4-7,Monica>I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,570
<5-1,Chandler>不敢相信  我们到了
<5-1,Chandler>I can't believe it! We're here!

98
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,840
<5-2,Monica>枕头上还放巧克力  我最喜欢这样了
<5-2,Monica>Chocolates on the pillows! I love that!

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,710
<5-3,Chandler>那你应该跟乔伊住  到处都有巧克力糖
<5-3,Chandler>You should live with Joey. Rolos everywhere.

100
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,290
<5-4,Monica>我马上就好
<5-4,Monica>Okay, be right back.

101
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,330
<5-4,Monica>万岁
<5-4,Monica>Oh, yes!

102
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,430
<5-5,Chandler>莫妮卡  快来  正在转播警匪公路追逐战
<5-5,Chandler>Monica, get in here. There's a high-speed car chase on!

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,420
<5-6,Monica>我们要换房间
<5-6,Monica>We're switching rooms.

104
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,350
<5-7,Chandler>天啊  他们给了我们玻璃杯
<5-7,Chandler>Oh, dear God! They gave us glasses!

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,930
<5-8,Monica>杯子上有口红印
<5-8,Monica>No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them!

106
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,480
<5-8,Monica>如果连杯子都没换
<5-8,Monica>If they didn't change the glasses,

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,800
<5-8,Monica>谁知道还有哪些东西没换
<5-8,Monica>who knows what else they didn't change?

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,200
<7-7,Rachel>我知道  真离谱  我也看不到你
<7-7,Rachel>I know, it's ridiculous. I can't see you, either.

131
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,270
<8-1,Hotel Clerk>你们可能会喜欢这间房
<8-1,Hotel Clerk>I think you'll find this room more to your liking.

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,750
<8-2,Chandler>太好了

134
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,470
<8-4,Chandler>一半  那还可以跑很久呢
<8-4,Chandler>Half a tank? We still got a lots of high-speed chasing to do!

135
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,530
<8-5,Monica>我们还得换房间
<8-5,Monica>We're switching rooms again.

136
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,630
<8-6,Chandler>什么  为什么
<8-6,Chandler>What? Why?

137
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,950
<8-7,Monica>这间房是花园景观  我们订的是观海房
<8-7,Monica>This has a garden view room. We paid for an ocean view room.

138
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,660
<8-8,Hotel Clerk>只剩一间观海房  可是你们不喜欢
<8-8,Hotel Clerk>Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.

139
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,880
<8-9,Monica>不好意思  我可以跟你谈一下吗
<8-9,Monica>Excuse me. Can I talk to you over here for just a second?

140
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,370
<8-10,Chandler>-钱德勒  -来了
<8-10,Chandler>- Chandler! - Yeah.

141
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,930
<8-12,Chandler>这些小人想占我们便宜
<8-12,Chandler>Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride

142
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,140
<8-13,Monica>我不能让他们得逞
<8-13,Monica>and I'm not gonna let 'em.

143
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,810
<8-13,Monica>咱们可不是好欺负的
<8-13,Monica>We're not a couple of suckers.

144
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,000
<8-14,Chandler>说得好  大姐头
<8-14,Chandler>I hear you, Mugsy.

145
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,360
<8-14,Chandler>这些房间都还不错
<8-14,Chandler>But look, all these rooms are fine okay?

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,090
<8-14,Chandler>你赶快选定  让我可以看...
<8-14,Chandler>Can you just pick one so I can watch

147
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,220
<8-14,Chandler>让我可以和你一起好好度过完美的周末
<8-14,Chandler>have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.

148
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,210
<8-15,Monica>我喜欢这间
<8-15,Monica>Okay, this one I like!

149
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,760
<8-16,Chandler>没了  没了  结束了  可恶
<8-16,Chandler>Nothing. Nothing. It's over. Damn it!

150
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,250
<8-16,Chandler>竟然没有延长时间
<8-16,Chandler>This is regularly scheduled programming!

151
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,640
<8-17,Monica>可以关掉电视吗
<8-17,Monica>Can we turn the TV off?

152
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,600
<8-17,Monica>难道整个周末都要看电视吗
<8-17,Monica>Do we really want to spend the weekend like this?

153
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,560
<8-18,Chandler>抱歉  我是不是妨碍你换房间了
<8-18,Chandler>I'm sorry. Am I getting in the way of the room-switching fun?

154
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,300
<8-19,Monica>你火大可别怪到我身上
<8-19,Monica>Don't blame me for wigging tonight.

155
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,260
<8-20,Chandler>否则该怪谁
<8-20,Chandler>Oh, who should I blame?

156
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,790
<8-20,Chandler>任劳任怨拖着行李跑了十间房的行李员吗
<8-20,Chandler>The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?

157
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,520
<8-21,Monica>或许该怪那个以为用半箱汽油
<8-21,Monica>I don't know, how about the idiot who thought

158
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,110
<8-21,Monica>就可以从阿尔巴尼跑到加拿大的白痴
<8-21,Monica>he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!

159
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,780
<8-22,Chandler>不要说死者的坏话
<8-22,Chandler>Do not speak ill of the dead.

160
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,870
<8-23,Monica>我们出来是为了过浪漫周末
<8-23,Monica>We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.

161
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,930
<8-23,Monica>你到底是怎么回事
<8-23,Monica>What's the matter with you?

162
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,840
<8-24,Chandler>我只是想看点电视  有什么大不了的
<8-24,Chandler>I just want to watch a little television. What's the big deal.

163
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,710
<8-24,Chandler>放轻松点  老妈
<8-24,Chandler>Jeez, relax, Mom.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,230
<8-25,Monica>你说什么
<8-25,Monica>What did you say?

165
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,210
<8-26,Chandler>我说  放轻松  莫妮卡
<8-26,Chandler>I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

166

<9-1,Rachel>-嘿  什么事  -嘿
<9-1,Rachel>- Hey, what's up? - Hey.

<9-2,Ross>瑞秋  我一直有话要告诉你
<9-2,Ross>Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you something for and while now

168
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,490
<9-2,Ross>我非说不可
<9-2,Ross>and I really, I just have to get it out.

169
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,370
<9-3,Rachel>说吧  什么事
<9-3,Rachel>Okay. All right. What's up?

170
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,750
<9-4,Ross>你上次说
<9-4,Ross>Y'know how you told me

171
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,420
<9-4,Ross>我应该不惜代价挽救婚姻
<9-4,Ross>I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

172
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,690
<9-5,Rachel>对  我叫你答应艾蜜莉的所有要求
<9-5,Rachel>Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.

173
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,630
<9-6,Ross>建议不错
<9-6,Ross>And while that was good advice,

174
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,800
<9-6,Ross>不过你得知道她开的条件
<9-6,Ross>you should know that what she wants...

175
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
<9-7,Rachel>是什么
<9-7,Rachel>Yeah?

176
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,680
<9-8,Ross>就是叫我永远不能再见你
<9-8,Ross>...is for me not to see you anymore.

177
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,310
<9-9,Rachel>她疯了吗  你才做不到
<9-9,Rachel>That's crazy! You can't do that.

178
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,340
<9-9,Rachel>你要怎么告诉她
<9-9,Rachel>What are you going to tell her?

179
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,190
<9-9,Rachel>天啊
<9-9,Rachel>Oh, my God!

180
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,450
<9-9,Rachel>你已经答应了  对吗
<9-9,Rachel>You already agreed to this, haven't you?

181
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,720
<9-9,Rachel>我知道自己很恶劣
<9-9,Rachel>It's awful, I know.

182
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,060
<9-10,Ross>我感觉很糟糕
<9-10,Ross>I mean I feel terrible but

183
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,910
<9-10,Ross>这是我挽救婚姻的唯一方法
<9-10,Ross>I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.

184
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,770
<9-10,Ross>我必须让这段婚姻成功  我没得选择
<9-10,Ross>And I do. I have to make this marriage work. I have to.

185
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
<9-10,Ross>但是好在
<9-10,Ross>But the good thing is,

186
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,840
<9-10,Ross>在她来之前  我们还可以见面
<9-10,Ross>we can still see each other until she gets here.

187
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,810
<9-11,Rachel>我真幸运  天啊
<9-11,Rachel>Lucky me! Oh, my God!

188
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,020
<9-11,Rachel>这真是好消息  罗斯
<9-11,Rachel>That is good news, Ross!

189
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,550
<9-11,Rachel>自从拉普过世之后这是最大的好消息
<9-11,Rachel>I think that's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!

190
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,740
<9-12,Ross>你不知道我有多难过
<9-12,Ross>You have no idea what a nightmare this has been.

191
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,360
<9-12,Ross>这个选择太难了
<9-12,Ross>This is so hard.

192
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,570
<9-13,Rachel>是吗  真的吗  罗斯
<9-13,Rachel>Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

193
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,160
<9-13,Rachel>我可以为你减轻压力
<9-13,Rachel>Let me just make this little easier for you.

194
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,950
<9-14,Ross>你做什么
<9-14,Ross>What are you doing?

195
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,340
<9-16,Ross>-摔门而去  -瑞秋  这是你的家
<9-16,Ross>- Storming out. - Rachel, it's your apartment.

196
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,030
<9-17,Rachel>是吗  知道我有多生气了吗
<9-17,Rachel>Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

197
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,800
<10-3,Chandler>臭巧克力糖
<10-3,Chandler>Damn Rolos!

198
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,200
<10-4,Joey>你回来了  开会怎么样
<10-4,Joey>You're back! How was your conference?

199
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,250
<10-5,Chandler>糟透了  我一直在跟...同事吵架
<10-5,Chandler>It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues the entire time.

200
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,680
<10-5,Chandler>你有没有搞错
<10-5,Chandler>Are you kidding with this?

201
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,380
<10-6,Joey>那么整个周末都泡汤了吗
<10-6,Joey>So your weekend was a total bust?

202
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,570
<10-7,Chandler>也不会  我看到唐纳·川普等电梯
<10-7,Chandler>No, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.

203
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,600
<10-9,Joey>-嗨  -你也回来了
<10-9,Joey>- Hi. - You're back too.

204
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,270
<10-10,Monica>是的  钱德勒  可以出来一下吗
<10-10,Monica>Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for just a second?

205
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,240
<10-11,Joey>-烹饪大会好玩吗  -糟透了
<10-11,Joey>- How was your chef thing? - It was awful.

206
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,010
<10-12,Monica>有些人根本不会欣赏美食
<10-12,Monica>I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.

207
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,640
<10-13,Chandler>可能食物开始吃起来很美味
<10-13,Chandler>Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first

208
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,940
<10-13,Chandler>吃下去却害人上吐下泻
<10-13,Chandler>but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.

209
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,800
<10-14,Monica>钱德勒
<10-14,Monica>Chandler!

210
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
<10-15,Chandler>莫妮卡
<10-15,Chandler>Monica!

211
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,830
<10-16,Monica>好了  饭店费用多少
<10-16,Monica>Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was

212
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,890
<10-16,Monica>我要付我那一半
<10-16,Monica>because I'd like to pay my half.

213
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,090
<10-17,Chandler>很好  三百块
<10-17,Chandler>Fine. $300.

214
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,360
<10-18,Monica>三百块
<10-18,Monica>$300?

215
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,180
<10-19,Chandler>就想成每间房二十五块
<10-19,Chandler>Just think of it as $25 per room.

216
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,230
<10-21,Joey>你们鬼叫什么
<10-21,Joey>What are you guys woofing about?

217
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,140
<10-22,Monica>钱德勒从我皮包里偷了二十块
<10-22,Monica>Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

218
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,870
<10-22,Monica>不是吧
<10-22,Monica>No!

219
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,490
<10-23,Joey>知道吗  现在回头想想
<10-23,Joey>You know what? Now that I think about it...

220
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,790
<10-23,Joey>我老没二十块  而你
<10-23,Joey>...I constantly find myself without 20s, and you...

221
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,900
<10-23,Joey>皮夹里倒是很多
<10-23,Joey>...always have lots.

222
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,600
<11-1,Ross>你们应该看看她当时的表情
<11-1,Ross>You should've seen the look on her face.

223
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,350
<11-1,Ross>我不希望瑞秋恨我  我不知道该怎么办
<11-1,Ross>I don't want Rachel to hate me. I don't know what to do.

224
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,670
<11-2,Joey>-你要听我的建议吗  -请说
<11-2,Joey>- You want my advice? - Yes. Please.

225
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,520
<11-5,Ross>-你听了一定不高兴  -没关系
<11-5,Ross>- You won't like it. - That's okay.

226
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,650
<11-6,Joey>你决定结婚太仓促了
<11-6,Joey>You got married too fast.

227
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,660
<11-7,Ross>-这算哪门子建议  -看吧
<11-7,Ross>- That's not advice. - I told you.

228
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,830
<11-9,Ross>我去洗手间
<11-9,Ross>I'm going to the bathroom.

229
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,940
<11-10,Joey>要是有人叫我别见你们其中一个
<11-10,Joey>Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you,

230
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,490
<11-11,Chandler and Phoebe>-我绝对办不到  -我也不行
<11-11,Chandler and Phoebe>- I don't think I can do it. - Me neither.

231
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,970
<11-12,Monica>或许我可以
<11-12,Monica>Maybe I could do it.

232
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,470
<11-17,Monica>我知道你们听说了罗斯跟我的事情
<11-17,Monica>Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross,

233
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,700
<11-18,Rachel>我已经烦了一整天
<11-18,Rachel>but you know, I've been obsessing about it all day

234
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,120
<11-18,Rachel>请你们别再提起了
<11-18,Rachel>and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?

235
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,410
<11-19,Joey>我不知道这算不算提起
<11-19,Joey>I don't know if this falls under that category...

236
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,750
<11-19,Joey>不过罗斯就在后面
<11-19,Joey>...but Ross is right back there.

237
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,260
<11-20,Rachel>-那才不是罗斯  -不是那个
<11-20,Rachel>- That's not Ross. - Not that guy.

238
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,720
<11-21,Phoebe>不过很像
<11-21,Phoebe>He does look like him, though.

239
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,030
<11-22,Chandler>罗斯去洗手间了
<11-22,Chandler>Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.

240
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,710
<11-23,Rachel>天啊  开始了
<11-23,Rachel>Oh, my God! It's happening.

241
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,270
<11-23,Rachel>现在就这样了  我就像阿吉
<11-23,Rachel>It's already started. I'm Kip.

242
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
<11-24,Joey>你才不是阿吉
<11-24,Joey>Yeah, you're not Kip.

243
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,070
<11-25,Rachel>你知道阿吉是谁吗
<11-25,Rachel>Do you even know who Kip is?

244
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,510
<11-26,Joey>管他呢  你是瑞秋
<11-26,Joey>Who cares? You're Rachel.

245
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,250
<11-26,Joey>阿吉是谁
<11-26,Joey>Who's Kip?

246
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,650
<11-27,Chandler>阿吉是我以前的室友  也跟大家很好
<11-27,Chandler>Kip, my old roommate. Y'know we all used to hang out together.

247
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,320
<11-28,Joey>那个可怜的混蛋
<11-28,Joey>Oh, that poor bastard.

248
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,800
<11-29,Rachel>你们跟我说过那件事  他跟莫妮卡约会过
<11-29,Rachel>See, you told me the story. He and Monica dated.

249
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,260
<11-29,Rachel>分手后  他们没办法共处一室
<11-29,Rachel>When they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together

250
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,400
<11-29,Rachel>你们都答应继续做他的朋友
<11-29,Rachel>you all promised you'd stay his friend.

251
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,190
<11-29,Rachel>结果呢  他从此遭到排挤
<11-29,Rachel>And what happened? He got phased out.

252
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,170
<11-30,Monica>-我们才不会排挤你  -一定会
<11-30,Monica>- You're not gonna be phased out. - Of course I am.

253
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,090
<11-31,Rachel>你们不会排挤罗斯
<11-31,Rachel>It won't happen to Ross.

254
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,930
<11-31,Rachel>因为他是你哥哥  你的大学室友
<11-31,Rachel>He's your brother, he's your college roommate.

255
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,000
<11-31,Rachel>迟早有人会离开这个小圈圈
<11-31,Rachel>You know it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group.

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,610
<11-31,Rachel>我以前还以为走的是菲比
<11-31,Rachel>I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.

257
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,030
<11-33,Rachel>亲爱的  你住得远  又不是谁的亲戚
<11-33,Rachel>Honey, come on. You live far away, you're not related.

258
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,500
<11-33,Rachel>很快就会被淡忘
<11-33,Rachel>You lift right out.

259
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,040
<12-2,Joey>嘿  宾先生
<12-2,Joey>Hey, Mr. Bing.

260
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,250
<12-2,Joey>你住的饭店打电话来了
<12-2,Joey>That hotel you stayed at called.

261
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,320
<12-2,Joey>说在你房间捡到睫毛夹
<12-2,Joey>Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.

262
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,660
<12-3,Chandler>是我的
<12-3,Chandler>Yes, that was mine.

263
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,360
<12-4,Joey>我以为你钓上哪个女生
<12-4,Joey>'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl

264
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,940
<12-4,Joey>她忘了带走
<12-4,Joey>and she'd left it there.

265
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,330
<12-5,Chandler>这种说法的确比较合理
<12-5,Chandler>That would have made more sense.

266
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,400
<12-6,Joey>我感觉都快要不认识你了
<12-6,Joey>You know, I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!

267
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,910
<12-6,Joey>听着  我只问你一次就好
<12-6,Joey>All right, look, I'm just going to ask you this one time.

268
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,540
<12-6,Joey>无论你怎么说  我都相信你
<12-6,Joey>Whatever you say, I'll believe you.

269
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,750
<12-6,Joey>你是不是去
<12-6,Joey>Were you or were you not...

270
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,000
<12-6,Joey>参加了同性恋邮轮行
<12-6,Joey>...on a gay cruise?

271
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,920
<12-6,Joey>菲比
<12-6,Joey>Phoebe!

272
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,120
<13-1,Rachel>我不该说大家会淡忘你
<13-1,Rachel>I'm sorry about the whole "lifting out" thing.

273
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,020
<13-1,Rachel>你得跟着我
<13-1,Rachel>You gotta come with me.

274
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,790
<13-2,Phoebe>-去哪里  -跟着我就对了
<13-2,Phoebe>- Come where? - Wherever I go.

275
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,140
<13-3,Rachel>我们可以重组一个朋友圈
<13-3,Rachel>You and me, we'll start a new group.

276
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,840
<13-3,Rachel>我跟你才是最好的
<13-3,Rachel>We're the best ones.

277
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,300
<13-4,Phoebe>好吧  不过记得拉乔伊入伙
<13-4,Phoebe>Okay, but try to get Joey too.

278
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,820
<13-5,Ross>菲比  我可以跟瑞秋单独谈谈吗
<13-5,Ross>Pheebs, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?

279
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,260
<13-6,Phoebe>当然
<13-6,Phoebe>Sure.

280
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
<13-6,Phoebe>再见  罗斯
<13-6,Phoebe>Bye, Ross.

281
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,270
<13-6,Phoebe>永远不见了
<13-6,Phoebe>Forever.

282
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,270
<13-7,Ross>-嗨  -嗨
<13-7,Ross>-Hi. - Hi.

283
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,780
<13-8,Rachel>你来做什么  这不是违反规定吗
<13-8,Rachel>What are you here? Isn't this against the rules?

284
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,580
<13-9,Ross>我跟莫妮卡谈过了
<13-9,Ross>I talked to Monica.

285
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,850
<13-9,Ross>是我做的这个选择
<13-9,Ross>Look, I'm the one who made the choice.

286
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,750
<13-9,Ross>我害大家必须要改变
<13-9,Ross>I'm the one who's making things change.

287
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,460
<13-9,Ross>所以离开的应该是我
<13-9,Ross>So I should be the one to, you know, step back.

288
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,700
<13-10,Rachel>-罗斯  -真的没关系
<13-10,Rachel>- Ross. - No, no, it's okay. Really.

289
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,170
<13-11,Ross>很多人只有在感恩节才见到妹妹
<13-11,Ross>Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving...

290
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,890
<13-11,Ross>同学会才见到大学室友
<13-11,Ross>just see their college roommates at reunions...

291
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,910
<13-11,Ross>在"汉堡王"才见到乔伊
<13-11,Ross>...just see Joey at Burger King.

292
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,850
<13-11,Ross>这样你舒服一点了吗
<13-11,Ross>Is that better?

293
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,680
<13-12,Rachel>一点也没有
<13-12,Rachel>No, it's not better.

294
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,180
<13-12,Rachel>我还是见不到你
<13-12,Rachel>I still don't get to see you.

295
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,620
<13-13,Ross>换作你会怎么做  如果你是我
<13-13,Ross>What would you do? Rach, if you were me,

296
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,490
<13-13,Ross>你会怎么做
<13-13,Ross>what would you do?

297
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,450
<13-14,Rachel>首先  我在婚礼上就不会说错名字
<13-14,Rachel>Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!

298
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,380
<13-15,Ross>真不敢相信会这样
<13-15,Ross>I can't believe this happening.

299
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,720
<13-16,Rachel>我知道
<13-16,Rachel>I know.

300
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,060
<13-17,Ross>我很抱歉

301
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,490
<13-18,Rachel>我也知道
<13-18,Rachel>I know that too.

302
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,610
<13-18,Rachel>瑞秋
<13-18,Rachel>Hey, Rach?

303
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,650
<13-19,Joey>抱歉打扰
<13-19,Joey>Sorry to interrupt,

304
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,280
<13-19,Joey>菲比说我们要去哪里...
<13-19,Joey>but Phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip or something?

305
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,310
<14-1,Chandler>我来拿...
<14-1,Chandler>I just came over to drop off...

306
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,220
<14-2,Monica>没事
<14-2,Monica>...nothing.

307
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,290
<14-3,Chandler>上周末实在是差劲吧
<14-3,Chandler>So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?

308
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,290
<14-4,Monica>没错
<14-4,Monica>Yeah, it did.

309
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,060
<14-5,Chandler>那我想我们到此结束了
<14-5,Chandler>So I guess this is over?

310
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,190
<14-6,Monica>什么
<14-6,Monica>What?

311
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,930
<14-7,Chandler>我是说你跟我  反正迟早得结束
<14-7,Chandler>You know, you and me. I mean, it had to end sometime.

312
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,510
<14-8,Monica>为什么
<14-8,Monica>Why exactly?

313
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,010
<14-9,Chandler>因为我们上周末吵架啊
<14-9,Chandler>Because of the weekend. We had a fight.

314
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,750
<14-10,Monica>钱德勒  你疯了吗
<14-10,Monica>Chandler, that's crazy.

315
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,180
<14-10,Monica>如果你每次吵架就分手
<14-10,Monica>If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone

316
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,040
<14-10,Monica>交往大概不会超过...
<14-10,Monica>...you'd never be with anyone longer than...

317
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,360
<14-10,Monica>原来如此
<14-10,Monica>Ohhh!

<14-12,Monica>当然没有  我们只是吵架
<14-12,Monica>No, no. It was a fight.

321
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,340
<14-12,Monica>吵过之后就算了  根本没什么好担心
<14-12,Monica>You deal with it and you move on. It's nothing to freak out about.

322
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,740
<14-13,Chandler>真的吗  太好了
<14-13,Chandler>Really? Okay, great!

<16-7,Joey>The reason we didn't tell anyone

340
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,990
<16-8,Chandler>是因为不想小题大做
<16-8,Chandler>was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

<18-1,Phoebe>"嗨  菲比"
<18-1,Phoebe>'Hi, Phoebe!'"
