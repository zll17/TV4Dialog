<3-7,Chandler>然后艾尔叫我到他办公室
<3-7,Chandler>...and Big Al calls me into his office

43
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,210
<3-13,Chandler>不就代表承认这就是我的职业
<3-13,Chandler>I'd be admitting that this is what I do.

44
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,840
<3-14,Phoebe>那不是能赚更多钱
<3-14,Phoebe>Was it a lot more money?

<3-24,Chandler>我没有太多厨师的经验
<3-24,Chandler>I just don't have a lot of chef-ing experience.

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,810
<3-24,Chandler>除非那是家只卖吐司的餐厅
<3-24,Chandler>Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

<6-23,Monica>温蒂的经验丰富  是个职业服务生
<6-23,Monica>Wendy's more of a professional waitress.

156
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,510
<6-24,Rachel>我应该继续保持业余的姿态
<6-24,Rachel>And I'm maintaining my amateur status

157
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,320
<6-24,Rachel>将来才能在奥运会上当服务生

<8-2,Ross>I panicked, all right? She took me by surprise.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,880
<8-2,Ross>但也不算一败涂地  我们以爱抚收场
<8-2,Ross>But it wasn't a total loss. We ended up cuddling.

172
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,960
<8-3,Joey>爱抚了啊  几次
<8-3,Joey>You cuddled? How many times?

<12-34,Monica>-把他们给我  -这样不值得
<12-34,Monica>- Give them to me! - It's not worth it!

<12-42,Monica>这种机会我已等了七年
<12-42,Monica>I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this...

302
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:29,320
<12-42,Monica>而你却等不了四分半钟之后再吃洋葱馅饼
<12-42,Monica>...and you can't wait 4 1/2 minutes for a stupid tartlet?

303
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,320
<13-2,Rachel>你不会想为那种人工作的
<13-2,Rachel>You don't wanna work for that guy like that.

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,850
<13-4,Monica>我知道  我只是以为我的机会来了
<13-4,Monica>I know, I just thought that this was it.

305
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,210
<13-5,Ross>不要担心  你是个了不起的厨师
<13-5,Ross>You get it. You're an amazing chef.

309
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,800
<13-10,Ross>我是讲下流话的行家
<13-10,Ross>I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

310
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,930
<13-10,Ross>那简直是天下最具巧思的下流话
<13-10,Ross>It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard.

311
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:19,230
<13-10,Ross>有人物  主线
<13-10,Ross>I mean, there were characters, plot lines,

<13-10,Ross>其中一段连村民都冒出来了
<13-10,Ross>At one point, there were villagers.

314
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,220
<13-11,Joey>然后呢
<13-11,Joey>And?

315
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,340
<13-12,Ross>下流话讲完后已经有点晚了
<13-12,Ross>By the time we finished all the dirty talk it was kind of late

316
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,210
<13-12,Ross>而且我们也有点没劲了  所以
<13-12,Ross>and we were kind of exhausted, so...

317
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,620
<13-14,Ross>-你们爱抚  -那种感觉好好
<13-14,Ross>- You cuddled. - Yeah, which was nice.

<13-15,Phoebe>Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie?

319
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,710
<13-16,Rachel>或许吧  但我们不是该等钱德勒吗
<13-16,Rachel>Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

320
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,060
<13-17,Joey>他到底跑哪儿去了
<13-17,Joey>Where the hell is he?

321
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,560
<14-1,Chandler>对  朋友  我知道现在几点
<14-1,Chandler>Yes, friends, I know what time it is...

322
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,290
<14-1,Chandler>但我看着"周净计"  它让我相当不高兴
<14-1,Chandler>...but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!

323
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,130
<14-1,Chandler>我跟你讲清楚
<14-1,Chandler>Let me tell you something.

324
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,600
<14-1,Chandler>你会在乎的  因为我在乎
<14-1,Chandler>You will care about it because I care about it.

325
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,430
<14-1,Chandler>明白了吗  很好
<14-1,Chandler>Got it? Good!

326
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,190
<15-3,Phoebe>这样如何
<15-3,Phoebe>How's this?

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
<15-4,Steve>不好意思  这边呢
<15-4,Steve>Sorry. How about over here?

328
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,770
<15-5,Phoebe>这就说明有效果了.
<15-5,Phoebe>That means it's working.

329
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,160
<15-6,Steve>-痛不痛  -不痛.
<15-6,Steve>- Does this hurt? - No.

330
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,760
<15-7,Phoebe>这样呢
<15-7,Phoebe>How about this?

331
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,330
<15-7,Phoebe>这就对了
<15-7,Phoebe>There you go!

332
