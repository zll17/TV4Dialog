<2-3,RICHARD>莫妮卡  我有个问题

61
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,120
<2-3,RICHARD>李洛他是全城最坏的小子
<2-3,RICHARD>Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town

62
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,170
<2-3,RICHARD>还是全城最胖的小子
<2-3,RICHARD>or the fattest man in the whole damn town?

63
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,990
<2-4,MONICA>最坏  不然那首歌
<2-4,MONICA>Baddest. Otherwise the song

64
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,120
<2-4,MONICA>就会叫《胖小子李洛布朗》了
<2-4,MONICA>would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,190
<2-5,RICHARD>你在干什么
<2-5,RICHARD>What're you doing?

66
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,250
<2-6,MONICA>只是在等你  甜心
<2-6,MONICA>Just waiting for you sweetie.

67
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,370
<2-7,RICHARD>你在重新铺床吗
<2-7,RICHARD>Are you remaking the bed?

68
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,220
<2-8,MONICA>对不起  你铺的样子完全没有问题
<2-8,MONICA>I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.

69
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,780
<2-9,RICHARD>那你重新铺是因为...
<2-9,RICHARD>Then, you're redoing it because...

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,400
<2-10,MONICA>说出来你会认为我疯了
<2-10,MONICA>If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

71
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,300
<2-11,RICHARD>你说不说都会有这个危险
<2-11,RICHARD>You're pretty much running that risk either way.

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
<2-12,MONICA>你看
<2-12,MONICA>Ok, you see,

73
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,120
<2-12,MONICA>被子的商标不该在床的左上角
<2-12,MONICA>the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner,

74
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,300
<2-12,MONICA>应该在床的右下角才对
<2-12,MONICA>it should be at the bottom right corner.

75
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,990
<2-13,RICHARD>这不算很疯狂
<2-13,RICHARD>Oh, well that's not so crazy.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,510
<2-14,MONICA>我只是在帮你热身
<2-14,MONICA>I'm just easing you in.

<2-16,MONICA>Alright, you see these little flower blossoms?

79
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,640
<2-16,MONICA>应该朝上不是朝下
<2-16,MONICA>They should be facing up, not down,

80
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,610
<2-16,MONICA>因为床头的位置  是太阳的方向
<2-16,MONICA>because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,220
<2-16,MONICA>你不再爱我了  是不是
<2-16,MONICA>You don't love me any more do you.

<8-21,JOEY>听着  抱歉  但乔瑟夫就是这样的
<8-21,JOEY>Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok.

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,340
<8-21,JOEY>你想耍花招的话  他会揭发你的
<8-21,JOEY>If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it.

247
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,960
<8-21,JOEY>他会说  "你耍什么花招"
<8-21,JOEY>"What're you tryin' to pull," he'll say.

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,100
<9-1,RICHARD>胶带  我是不是也该带点什么来
<9-1,RICHARD>Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?

<9-2,MONICA>是给那对抓痒鸳鸯的
<9-2,MONICA>This is for the scratchy twins out there.

250
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,950
<9-2,MONICA>我把隔热手套绑在他们手上了
<9-2,MONICA>I taped oven mits to their hands.

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,330
<9-4,MONICA>这是为他们好啊
<9-4,MONICA>It's for their own good.

<9-5,RICHARD>我很欣赏你有效率的
<9-5,RICHARD>You know, I like the way you have efficiently

254
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,830
<9-5,RICHARD>把胶带的末端折起来
<9-5,RICHARD>folded this tab under.

255
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,430
<9-5,RICHARD>这样急用胶带的时候
<9-5,RICHARD>See in a tape emergency

256
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,280
<9-5,RICHARD>就省下了好几秒宝贵的时间

259
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,920
<9-6,MONICA>告诉我实话
<9-6,MONICA>Tell me the truth.

260
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,760
<9-6,MONICA>现在你桌上摆的东西都成直角
<9-6,MONICA>Don't you like it better now that everything

261
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,220
<9-6,MONICA>不是好多了吗
<9-6,MONICA>on your desk is perpendicular?

262
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,340
<9-7,RICHARD>如果不是直角  那就是错角
<9-7,RICHARD>If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

263
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,960
<9-8,MONICA>很好

<9-12,MONICA>我要把它调成我的时间
<9-12,MONICA>I'm gonna set them to my time.

268
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,250
<9-13,RICHARD>我糊涂了  时间不都是一样的吗
<9-13,RICHARD>Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.

269
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,340
<9-14,MONICA>不  我把房间的时钟调快了六分钟
<9-14,MONICA>No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.

270
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,250
<9-14,MONICA>想不想知道原因
<9-14,MONICA>You wanna know why?

271
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,880
<9-15,RICHARD>因为卧室跟厨房在不同的时区里
<9-15,RICHARD>Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.

<9-20,MONICA>你根本没有任何可爱的小怪癖
<9-20,MONICA>No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.

277
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,070
<9-21,RICHARD>那不对  不对
<9-21,RICHARD>No that's not true. That is not true.

<9-24,MONICA>Ok.

281
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,290
<9-25,RICHARD>我的怪癖是
<9-25,RICHARD>Ahh. One of my things is,

282
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,770
<9-25,RICHARD>我总是把运动袜  跟西装袜分开来放
<9-25,RICHARD>I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.

283
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,430
<9-26,MONICA>如果搞混了会怎样
<9-26,MONICA>What if they get mixed up?

284
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,890
<9-27,RICHARD>天啊  那我会  我会发狂的
<9-27,RICHARD>Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.

285
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,470
<9-28,MONICA>你才不会  我真不敢相信
<9-28,MONICA>You would not. I can't believe this.

286
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,630
<9-28,MONICA>真讨厌你那么正常
<9-28,MONICA>I hate this, you're too normal.

287
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,840
<9-28,MONICA>真不敢相信我的男朋友没怪癖
<9-28,MONICA>I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

288
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,490
<9-28,MONICA>我的男朋友没有怪癖
<9-28,MONICA>My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

289
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,180
<9-29,RICHARD>如果这话被人听到  别人会怀疑我无能
<9-29,RICHARD>See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.

290
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,690
<10-1,JOEY>道格拉斯先生正在找你
<10-1,JOEY>Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

291
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,530
<10-2,CHANDLER>为什么  道格拉斯为什么要找我
<10-2,CHANDLER>Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

292
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,730
<10-3,JOEY>因为他怀疑
<10-3,JOEY>'Cause he has a strong suspicion

293
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,920
<10-3,JOEY>你搞砸了那个银行项目
<10-3,JOEY>that you dropped the ball on the lender project.

294
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,880
<10-4,CHANDLER>为什么  为什么他要怀疑我
<10-4,CHANDLER>Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?

295
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,720
<10-5,JOEY>因为开始他以为是乔瑟夫的错
<10-5,JOEY>Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph.

296
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,740
<10-5,JOEY>但在问了乔瑟夫之后  发现原来是你
<10-5,JOEY>But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.

297
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,730
<10-5,JOEY>反正我想你应该知道啦
<10-5,JOEY>Anyway, I just thought you should know.

298
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,870
<10-5,JOEY>好吧  够了
<10-5,JOEY>Alright, that's it.

<10-6,CHANDLER>Look Joey, I'm sorry,

300
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,410
<10-6,CHANDLER>我知道这是你一生难求的好角色
<10-6,CHANDLER>I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya,

301
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,280
<10-6,CHANDLER>如果可以只开除乔瑟夫  我会的
<10-6,CHANDLER>and if I could just fire Joseph, I would,

302
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,110
<10-6,CHANDLER>但不幸的是  这不可能  所以
<10-6,CHANDLER>but unfortunately that's not possible so

303
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,940
<10-6,CHANDLER>我必须要你们两个一起走人
<10-6,CHANDLER>I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

304
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,840
<10-7,JOEY>你在胡扯什么  大家都爱乔瑟夫
<10-7,JOEY>What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.

305
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,440
<10-8,CHANDLER>我不爱  我恨乔瑟夫
<10-8,CHANDLER>I don't, I hate Joseph, ok.

306
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,720
<10-8,CHANDLER>我认为他是个马屁精
<10-8,CHANDLER>I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.

307
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,830
<10-9,JOEY>是吗  你不能开除乔瑟夫
<10-9,JOEY>Oh yeah? Well you can't fire Joseph.

308
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,340
<10-9,JOEY>知道为什么吗  因为他不在你的部门
<10-9,JOEY>You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,030
<10-10,CHANDLER>好吧  我不能开除乔瑟夫
<10-10,CHANDLER>Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph

310
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
<10-10,CHANDLER>但是我可以睡他老婆

00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,740
<12-6,MONICA>不  亲爱的  你必须睡床的那一边
<12-6,MONICA>No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed

354
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,600
<12-6,MONICA>是因为我必须睡床的这一边
<12-6,MONICA>because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.

355
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,690
<12-7,RICHARD>还是因为我让你这么以为呢
<12-7,RICHARD>Or so I would have you believe.

356
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,310
<12-8,MONICA>没什么大不了的  你喜欢睡床的一边
<12-8,MONICA>No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed,

357
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,000
<12-8,MONICA>每个人都有自己喜欢的一边
<12-8,MONICA>everybody has a side of the bed.

362
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,710
