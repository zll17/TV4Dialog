1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,380
<1-1,Joey>那个女孩一定是在对我放电
<1-1,Joey>I'm telling you, that girl totally winked at me!

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,840
<1-2,All>-她才没有  -她才没有
<1-2,All>- She did not wink at you.  - She did not wink at you.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,270
<1-2,All>你总觉得有人在对你放电
<1-2,All>You always think somebody's winking at you.

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,750
<1-2,All>我会说是  范莫里森唱的"土菠萝蜜"
<1-2,All>I have to say "Tupelo Honey" by Van Morrison.

20
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,270
<1-2,All>不会吧
<1-2,All>No way!

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,870
<2-1,Ross>我认为最浪漫的歌是"往日情怀"
<2-1,Ross>The most romantic song ever was "The Way We Were."

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,410
<2-2,Rachel>我觉得是艾尔顿·约翰
<2-2,Rachel>See, I, I think the one that Elton John

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,620
<2-3,Phoebe>给演《妙管家》的那人写的歌
<2-3,Phoebe>wrote for that guy on Who's the Boss?

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,560
<2-4,Rachel>那是什么歌
<2-4,Rachel>What song was that?

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,830
<2-5,Phoebe>抱紧我  年轻的托尼·丹泽

<2-7,Ross>莫妮卡早
<2-7,Ross>Hey, Mon.

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,970
<2-8,Rachel>天啊
<2-8,Rachel>Oh,my God!

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,240
<2-9,Phoebe>-她到底有没有睡觉  -没有
<2-9,Phoebe>- Has she slept at all? - No.

31
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,370
<2-11,Rachel>没有  已经连续三个晚上了
<2-11,Rachel>No, it's been three nights in a row.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,470
<2-12,Ross>昨天她终于不哭了
<2-12,Ross>Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday.

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,880
<2-12,Ross>可后来她又在阳台发现了理查抽过的雪茄
<2-12,Ross>But then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace....

34
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,840
<2-13,Phoebe>好吧  这解释了
<2-13,Phoebe>Okay,that explains it.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,770
<2-13,Phoebe>我在凌晨两点接到的那通电话
<2-13,Phoebe>I got a call at 2 in the morning...

36
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,540
<2-13,Phoebe>对方只能发出一些咯吱咯吱的声响
<2-13,Phoebe>...and all I could hear was like this squeaky sound.

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,230
<2-13,Phoebe>我就想一定是老鼠或负鼠打来的
<2-13,Phoebe>So I thought,"Oh, okay, It's like a mouse or a possum."

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,430
<2-13,Phoebe>接着我才意识到
<2-13,Phoebe>Then I realized,like...

39
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,650
<2-13,Phoebe>拜托  老鼠或负鼠
<2-13,Phoebe>okay, where would a mouse or a possum

40
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,660
<2-13,Phoebe>怎么会有钱打电话呢
<2-13,Phoebe>get the money to make the phone call?

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,580
<3-1,Chandler>-早  -早
<3-1,Chandler>-Morning. -Morning.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,540
<3-2,Joey>你做了松饼啊
<3-2,Joey>You made pancakes?

43
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,430
<3-3,Chandler>是啊  你还以为我真的会做呢
<3-3,Chandler>Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,070
<3-4,Janice>莫妮卡和瑞秋那儿有糖浆
<3-4,Janice>Monica and Rachel had syrup

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,400
<3-4,Janice>我可以让我的男人开心了
<3-4,Janice>Now I can get my man to cheer up

46
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,870
<3-5,Joey>早安  乔伊
<3-5,Joey>Good morning,Joey.

47
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,930
<3-5,Joey>早安
<3-5,Joey>Good morning.

48
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,050
<3-6,Chandler>不如这样  我有个主意
<3-6,Chandler>Hey, you know what? Here's a thought.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,030
<3-6,Chandler>你干脆别去上班  在家陪陪我如何
<3-6,Chandler>Why don't you stay home from work and just hang out with me?

50
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,950
<3-7,Janice>我也想啊
<3-7,Janice>Oh,I wish.

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,790
<3-7,Janice>你有报告要写  而我得去见律师
<3-7,Janice>You have that report to finish,and I've got to see my lawyer.

52
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,810
<3-8,Chandler>我真不敢相信  我竟然跟要离婚的女人约会
<3-8,Chandler>I can't believe I'm going out with somebody who's getting divorced.

53
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,330
<3-8,Chandler>我真是成年人了
<3-8,Chandler>I'm such a grownup.

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,090
<3-9,Janice>我要走了  我要走了
<3-9,Janice>I gotta go,I gotta go.

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,330
<3-9,Janice>不过你得先吻我一下
<3-9,Janice>Not without a kiss.

56
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,760
<3-10,Chandler>或者我就不吻你  这样你就不走了
<3-10,Chandler>Maybe I won't kiss you and then you'll have to stay.

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,750
<3-11,Joey>亲她  快亲她
<3-11,Joey>Kiss her. Kiss her!

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,210
<3-18,Chandler>她让我很快乐
<3-18,Chandler>She makes me happy.

67
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,100
<3-18,Chandler>好吧  好吧
<3-18,Chandler>Okay, alright.

68
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,570
<3-19,Joey>你看着我的眼睛  不许眨眼  告诉我
<3-19,Joey>You look me in the eye and tell me,without blinking...

69
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,190
<3-19,Joey>说你不会跟她分手  不许眨眼睛
<3-19,Joey>...that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,060
<3-20,Chandler>我不会跟她分手
<3-20,Chandler>I'm not breaking up with her!

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,600
<4-1,Monica>天啊  你看我在下水道里发现什么

73
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,790
<4-3,Monica>这些是理查的头发
<4-3,Monica>It's some of Richard's hair!

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,980
<4-3,Monica>我该怎么处理
<4-3,Monica>What do I do with this?

75
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,450
<4-4,Ross>首先就是把它从我身边拿开
<4-4,Ross>Getting it away from me would be job one.

76
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,990
<4-5,Monica>这确实挺诡异的  但我并不想把它丢掉
<4-5,Monica>It's weird, but you know, I don't want to throw this away.

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,060
<4-5,Monica>这些是我仅有的属于他的东西
<4-5,Monica>I mean, this is like all I have left of him.

78
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,040
<4-5,Monica>呕心的

79
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,990
<4-5,Monica>下水管的头发
<4-5,Monica>...drain hair.

80
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,640
<4-6,Phoebe>真好玩  好像有一个小人
<4-6,Phoebe>Cool! It looks like a tiny little person

81
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,240
<4-6,Phoebe>在你的麦片里淹死了
<4-6,Phoebe>drowning in your cereal.

82
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,930
<4-7,Monica>-我是怎么了  -你需要些睡眠
<4-7,Monica>-God, what is wrong with me? -You need to get some sleep.

83
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,640
<4-9,Monica>我需要的是理查
<4-9,Monica>I need to get some Richard.

84
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,410
<4-10,Rachel>莫妮卡  你跟他分手是有原因的
<4-10,Rachel>Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.

85
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,500
<4-11,Monica>我知道  我只是不想再这么想他
<4-11,Monica>I know. I know. I'm just so tired of missing him.

86
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,190
<4-11,Monica>不愿再去想他为何不打来
<4-11,Monica>I'm tired of wondering why he hasn't called.

87
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,450
<4-11,Monica>他为什么不打来
<4-11,Monica>Why hasn't he called?

88
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,470
<4-12,Phoebe>可能因为你叫他别再打来了
<4-12,Phoebe>Maybe because you told him not to?

89
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,940
<4-13,Monica>你是谁啊  记忆女王吗
<4-13,Monica>What are you,the Memory Woman?

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
<4-14,Joey>他们不会分手了  我是说钱德勒和珍妮斯
<4-14,Joey>They're not breaking up! Chandler and Janice?

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,680
<4-14,Joey>他们不会分手了  他都没眨一下眼
<4-14,Joey>They're not breaking up! He didn't blink or anything!

92
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,760
<4-15,Rachel>我一点也不惊讶  你看过他们在一起的样子吗
<4-15,Rachel>Well you know, I'm not surprised. Did you really see them together?

93
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,770
<4-15,Rachel>他们真的好可爱
<4-15,Rachel>They're really cute.

94
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,020
<4-16,Joey>可爱  我说的可是珍妮斯
<4-16,Joey>"Cute"? This is Janice!

95
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,440
<4-16,Joey>你还记得珍妮斯吗
<4-16,Joey>You remember Janice?

96
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,280
<4-17,Rachel>我记得啊  她是很烦人  但是你知道吗
<4-17,Rachel>Yes,Joey, I remember. She's annoying. But you know what?

97
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,100
<4-17,Rachel>她现在是他的女朋友  那我们该怎么办
<4-17,Rachel>She's his girlfriend now. I mean,what can we do?

98
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,770
<4-18,Joey>这就对了  我要的就是
<4-18,Joey>There you go! That's the spirit

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,330
<4-18,Joey>这种不妥协的精神  "我们该怎么办"
<4-18,Joey>I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

100
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,150
<4-18,Joey>好  谁先来  罗斯
<4-18,Joey>All right,who's first,huh? Ross?

101
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,170
<4-19,Ross>我想钱德勒是我们的朋友
<4-19,Ross>Well, I think Chandler's our friend,

102
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,590
<4-19,Ross>而珍妮斯能让他快乐
<4-19,Ross>and Janice makes him happy.

103
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,380
<4-19,Ross>所以我们就成熟点  接受她
<4-19,Ross>So I say we all just be adult about it and accept her.

104
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,560
<4-20,Joey>这个先归在B计划  好吗
<4-20,Joey>Yeah, we'll call that Plan B, alright?

105

<5-3,Rachel>你那套海军制服还在吗
<5-3,Rachel>...do you still have that Navy uniform?

108

<5-4,Ross>不  我还给戏服店了
<5-4,Ross>No,I had to return it to the costume place.

<5-6,Ross>我还有一套高中乐团的旧制服
<5-6,Ross>I think I have an old band uniform from high school.

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,360
<5-7,Rachel>-你记得高中生不能做爱吧 -是啊
<5-7,Rachel>- You remember not having sex in high school,right? - Mm.

<5-9,Rachel>-甜心  那么你呢  -什么
<5-9,Rachel>- Well,honey,what about you?  -What?

<5-10,Ross>你有过任何有趣的幻想之类的吗?
<5-10,Ross>I mean, fun,you know, fantasy-type things?

<5-14,Ross>没有
<5-14,Ross>Nope.

116
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,600
<5-15,Rachel>-罗斯 你知道吗  -什么
<5-15,Rachel>- Ross, you know what? - What?

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,130
<5-17,Rachel>如果你跟我说  或许我会帮你实现
<5-17,Rachel>If you tell me,I might do it.

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,340
<5-20,Ross>赫特人贾巴的戏
<5-20,Ross>...with Jabba the Hutt?

123
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,580
<5-20,Ross>贾巴把莉亚公主
<5-20,Ross>See, Jabba had as his prisoner...

124
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,280
<5-21,Rachel>挟持了
<5-21,Rachel>... Princess Leia.

125
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,430
<5-22,Ross>莉亚公主当时穿着
<5-22,Ross>Princess Leia was wearing...

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,020
<5-22,Ross>金色的比基尼

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
<5-22,Ross>真好看
<5-22,Ross>It was pretty cool.

128
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,140
<6-1,Phoebe>莉亚公主穿金色比基尼
<6-1,Phoebe>Yeah. Princess Leia and the gold bikini?

129
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,090
<6-1,Phoebe>我们这年纪的男人都很喜欢
<6-1,Phoebe>Every guy our age loved that.

130
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,650
<6-2,Rachel>真的吗
<6-2,Rachel>Really?

131
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,730
<6-3,Phoebe>那是意义重大的一刻
<6-3,Phoebe>It's huge!

132
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,810
<6-3,Phoebe>那一刻她不再是个公主
<6-3,Phoebe>That's the moment when you know, she stopped being a princess...

133
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,000
<6-3,Phoebe>而变成了  一个普通的女人
<6-3,Phoebe>...and she became,like,you know,a woman, you know.

134
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,700
<6-4,Rachel>你扮过莉亚公主吗

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,920
<7-8,Joey>我们总是一起去的
<7-8,Joey>I mean, we always go together.

168

170
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,400
<7-9,Chandler>但还是问一句  你是不是对珍妮斯不满
<7-9,Chandler>but do you, do you have a problem with Janice?

<7-11,Chandler>那个我讨厌的女孩子  她快把我逼疯了
<7-11,Chandler>That girl that I hate? She drives me crazy.

176
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,810
<7-12,Joey>我并不讨厌珍妮斯  只是她不那么好相处
<7-12,Joey>Look,I don't hate Janice. She's just a lot to take, you know?

177
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,430

<7-14,Joey>以前她也快把你逼疯  还记得吗
<7-14,Joey>She used to drive you nuts before too,remember?

180
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,080
<7-15,Chandler>但是我现在为她疯狂  这次可能是真爱
<7-15,Chandler>Yeah, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing.

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,770
<7-15,Chandler>大写的真  大写的爱
<7-15,Chandler>Capital R,capital T!

<7-15,Chandler>别担心  字母没拼错
<7-15,Chandler>Don't worry,those are the right letters.

183
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,830
<7-16,Joey>你到底要我说什么
<7-16,Joey>Look, what do you want me to say?

184
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,350
<7-17,Chandler>-我要你说你喜欢她  -我办不到
<7-17,Chandler>- I want you to say that you like her! - I can't

185
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,560
<7-18,Joey>这就像是某种化学反应
<7-18,Joey>lt's like this chemical thing, you know?

186
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,690
<7-18,Joey>每次她一开口笑  我就想...
<7-18,Joey>Every time she starts laughing,I just wanna...

187
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,280
<7-18,Joey>就想把我的手臂拧下来  好往她身上扔
<7-18,Joey>...pull my arm off just so I have something to throw at her.

188
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,960
<7-19,Chandler>谢谢你的努力
<7-19,Chandler>Thanks for trying.

189
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,070
<7-19,Chandler>对了  根本就没有拉什莫尔公爵
<7-19,Chandler>Oh,and by the way,there is no Count Rushmore!

190
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,550
<7-20,Joey>那是谁在拉什莫尔山上雕了那些总统肖像
<7-20,Joey>Then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?

192
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,920
<8-1,Ross>你怎么可以告诉她
<8-1,Ross>How could you have told her?

193
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,550
<8-2,Rachel>罗斯  我是想又没什么大不了的
<8-2,Rachel>Ross, I didn't think it would be that big a deal!

194
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,790
<8-3,Ross>她认为没什么大不了的
<8-3,Ross>She didn't think it would be that big a deal!

195
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,110
<8-4,Rachel>你想讨论这些的时候  你都会跟谁说
<8-4,Rachel>Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?

196
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,890
<8-5,Ross>这些应该是仅限于我们之间的私密对话
<8-5,Ross>Look,that was supposed to be a private,personal thing between us.

197
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,910
<8-6,Rachel>菲比是我的闺蜜  好吗 我们无话不谈
<8-6,Rachel>Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend,okay? We tell each other everything.

<8-6,Rachel>那些更衣室里的对话怎么说
<8-6,Rachel>I mean,what about all that locker-room stuff?

200
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,640
<8-7,Ross>那不一样
<8-7,Ross>That's different. Okay?

201
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,620
<8-7,Ross>我们会聊  比如谁跟脱衣舞娘约会了
<8-7,Ross>That's like, who dated a stripper?

202
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,070
<8-7,Ross>或谁在史坦登岛渡轮后面做爱
<8-7,Ross>Or who did it on the back of the Staten lsland ferry?

203
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,380
<8-8,Rachel>-都是乔伊干的吧  -没错
<8-8,Rachel>- Both of those Joey? - Yeah.

204
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,020
<8-9,Ross>但是绝不会谈到自己的女朋友
<8-9,Ross>But you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend...

205
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,150
<8-9,Ross>还有和她之间亲密的事
<8-9,Ross>...and the intimate stuff you do with her.

206
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,170
<8-10,Rachel>连最好的朋友也不说吗
<8-10,Rachel>Not even with your best friend?

208
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,540
<8-12,Rachel>真可悲

<8-12,Rachel>你们错过太多乐趣了  罗斯
<8-12,Rachel>You're missing out on so much, Ross.

210
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,030
<8-12,Rachel>那是种彼此维系  分享的乐趣
<8-12,Rachel>I mean,the bonding and the sharing, you know...

211
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,360
<8-12,Rachel>得知别人也有过和你一样的遭遇
<8-12,Rachel>...and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.

212
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,780
<8-13,Ross>那你们什么都跟对方说吗
<8-13,Ross>So, what, you tell each other everything?

213
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,700
<8-14,Rachel>差不多

217
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,660
<8-17,Ross>我知道  我想还是值得一提
<8-17,Ross>I know,but it's still worth mentioning,I think.

218
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,630
<9-1,Phoebe>全身肌肉放松
<9-1,Phoebe>Relax every muscle in your body.

243
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,790
<10-1,Janice>你讨厌我

244
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,840
<10-2,Joey>我没说过讨厌这个词  我用词可是很小心的
<10-2,Joey>I never said hate. I was very careful about that.

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,020
<10-3,Janice>有人私下告诉我
<10-3,Janice>A little birdie told me something about

246
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,820
<10-3,Janice>你想拧下手臂扔到我身上
<10-3,Janice>you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me.

247
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,890
<10-4,Joey>这样你就觉得我讨厌你
<10-4,Joey>And you got "hate" from that?

248
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,830
<10-4,Joey>你也太断章取义了吧
<10-4,Joey>You're taking a big leap there.

<10-5,Janice>好吧  好吧  好吧

<10-5,Janice>We have got to do something about our little situation here, Joey.

251
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,560
<10-5,Janice>我是这么想的
<10-5,Janice>So this is my idea.

<11-16,Ross>某个场景

<11-22,Ross>-Okay. -Okay.

290
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,740
<11-23,Chandler>当你跟一个女人在床上
<11-23,Chandler>Okay,you know when you're in bed with a woman...

291
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,480
<11-24,Ross>亲昵的时候
<11-24,Ross>and... you know, you fooling around with her...

292
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,270
<11-25,Chandler>脑袋里突然出现一些疯狂的画面
<11-25,Chandler>...and you get all these mental images in your brain?

293
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,100
<11-25,Chandler>比如超级名模艾拉·麦克弗森
<11-25,Chandler>Like Elle MacPherson

294
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,950
<11-25,Chandler>或是影印店的那个女孩
<11-25,Chandler>or that girl at the Xerox place?

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,130
<11-26,Ross>-穿了肚脐环的那个 -我知道
<11-26,Ross>- With the belly button ring? -I know.

296
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,590
<11-27,Chandler>但是突然之间  你妈忽然跃入脑海
<11-27,Chandler>And then all of a sudden,your mom pops into your head.

297
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,890
<11-27,Chandler>于是你就想  "妈  快走开"
<11-27,Chandler>And you're,like,"Mom,get out of here!"

298
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,190
<11-27,Chandler>但这之后  你就完全没情绪了
<11-27,Chandler>But of course, after that, you can't possibly think of anything else.

299
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,690
<11-27,Chandler>而你正在做的事又不能停止
<11-27,Chandler>And you can't, you know, stop what you're doing.

300
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,170
<11-27,Chandler>所以你就只能...
<11-27,Chandler>So it's kind of like you're...

301
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,170
<11-27,Chandler>你懂的
<11-27,Chandler>...you know...

302
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,480

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,220
<11-28,Ross>你不懂啊
<11-28,Ross>You don't know!

304
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,590
<11-28,Ross>你妈
<11-28,Ross>Your mom?

305
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,380
<11-28,Ross>你竟然会想到你妈  你有什么毛病啊
<11-28,Ross>You're telling me about your mom? What's the matter with you?

306
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,840
<11-30,Ross>-是你说...  -我说要分享  不是吓唬人
<11-30,Ross>-You said -I said "share," not "scare"!

307
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,430
<11-30,Ross>你给我坐到那边去
<11-30,Ross>Go sit over there!

321
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,130
<12-11,Joey>但是往好处想
<12-11,Joey>But hey, look, you know,the good thing is...

322
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,930
<12-11,Joey>我们一起过了一整天  我竟然还活着
<12-11,Joey>...is that we spent the whole day together and I survived.

<13-9,Monica>-理查怎么样了  -你不会想知道的
<13-9,Monica>-How's Richard doing? -You don't want to know.

<13-11,Monica>我真的很想知道
<13-11,Monica>No, I really, really do.

357
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,500
<13-14,Mr. Geller>比他跟芭芭拉分手时还糟
<13-14,Mr. Geller>Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.

358
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,290
<13-15,Monica>你不是故意这么说的吧
<13-15,Monica>You're not just saying that,are you?

361
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,130
<13-19,Monica>你觉得他会不会是要等你走后再哭
<13-19,Monica>Do you think he was waiting till after you left,so he could cry?

362
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,780
<13-20,Mr. Geller>或许吧

<13-22,Mr. Geller>宝贝  感情这回事很难说  就像我跟你妈
<13-22,Mr. Geller>Honey,relationships are hard. Like with your mom and me.

365
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,640
<13-22,Mr. Geller>大学毕业后  我们曾分手过一阵子
