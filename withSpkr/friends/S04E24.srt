236
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,990
<14-1,Rachel>然后我意识到  我一直以来做的事
<14-1,Rachel>And so then I realized,all the stuff that I had been doing...

237
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,610
<14-1,Rachel>向约书亚求婚
<14-1,Rachel>...proposing to Joshua,

238
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,370
<14-1,Rachel>骗罗斯说我没办法参加婚礼
<14-1,Rachel>lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding...

239
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,450
<14-1,Rachel>都只是一种...
<14-1,Rachel>...was all just a way

240
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,720
<14-2,Passenger>抱歉  可以打个岔吗
<14-2,Passenger>I'm sorry,can I interrupt?

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,180
<14-2,Passenger>你真是个很差劲  很差劲的人
<14-2,Passenger>I just want to say that you are a horrible,horrible person.

242
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,560
<14-3,Rachel>你说什么
<14-3,Rachel>Pardon me?

243
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,050
<14-4,Passenger>你说你爱那个男人
<14-4,Passenger>You say you love this man,

244
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,510
<14-4,Passenger>却要去破坏他的大喜之日
<14-4,Passenger>and yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life.

245
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,280
<14-4,Passenger>我不得不同意你朋友菲比的话
<14-4,Passenger>I'm afraid I have to agree with your friend Pheebs.

246
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,200
<14-4,Passenger>这是个很糟糕  很糟糕的打算
<14-4,Passenger>This is a terrible,terrible plan.

247
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,020
<14-5,Rachel>但他必须知道我的感受
<14-5,Rachel>But he has to know how I feel.

248
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,070
<14-6,Passenger>为什么
<14-6,Passenger>But why?

249
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,790
<14-6,Passenger>他爱那个艾蜜莉  这么做绝对没好处
<14-6,Passenger>He loves this Emily person. No good can come of this.

250
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,770
<14-7,Rachel>-我觉得你错了  -才怪
<14-7,Rachel>-Well,I think you're wrong. -Oh,no.

251
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,760
<14-8,Passenger>顺便说一句  很显然
<14-8,Passenger>And by the way,it seems to be perfectly clear

252
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,370
