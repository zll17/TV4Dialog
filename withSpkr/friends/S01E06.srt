<4-26,Chandler>开始我也无法接受
<4-26,Chandler>Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too,

133
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,090
<4-26,Chandler>但后来我想
<4-26,Chandler>but the way I look at it is,

134
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,080
<4-26,Chandler>这事我完全不吃亏啊
<4-26,Chandler>I get all the good stuff all the fun,

135
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,470
<4-26,Chandler>可以甜言蜜语  男欢女爱
<4-26,Chandler>all the talking, all the sex,

136
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,000
<4-26,Chandler>不用负任何责任
<4-26,Chandler>and none of the responsibility.

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,280
<4-26,Chandler>这是每个男人的梦想
<4-26,Chandler>I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!

138
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,610
<4-27,Phoebe>是吗  未必吧
<4-27,Phoebe>Oh, yeah. That is not true.

139
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,090
<4-27,Phoebe>罗斯  这是你的梦想吗
<4-27,Phoebe>Ross, is this your fantasy?

140
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,020
<4-28,Ross>当然不可能
<4-28,Ross>No, of course not!

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,950
<4-28,Ross>好吧  是
<4-28,Ross>Yeah, yeah, it is.

142
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,260
<4-29,Monica>你们男生不介意和
<4-29,Monica>So you guys don't mind going out with someone else

143
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,310
<4-29,Monica>已有对象的女人交往吗
<4-29,Monica>who's going out with someone else?

144
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,950
<4-30,Joey>我办不到
<4-30,Joey>I couldn't do it.

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,100
<4-31,Monica>干得好  乔伊

146
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,350
<4-32,Joey>和女人交往时  我必须确定
<4-32,Joey>When I'm with a woman, I need to know that

147
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,940
<4-32,Joey>我交往的对象比她多
<4-32,Joey>I'm going out with more people than she is.

148
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,290
<4-33,Ross>一夫一妻  值得商榷
<4-33,Ross>Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept.

149
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,570
<4-33,Ross>就人类学的观点而言
<4-33,Ross>I mean, anthropologically speaking-

150
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,990
<4-34,Ross>行  这是你们的损失
<4-34,Ross>Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.

151
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,090
<4-35,Monica>逗你的

153
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,540
<4-37,Ross>好吧  理查德·里奇提出这样的理论
<4-37,Ross>Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-

154

<5-2,Chandler>现在都这样打招呼吗  我喜欢
<5-2,Chandler>Are we greeting each other this way now? Cause I like that.

<5-3,Rachel>I did the windows, I did the floors...

157
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,580
<5-3,Rachel>我甚至还用了吸尘器上的所有装置
<5-3,Rachel>I even used all the attachments on the vacuum,

158
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,820
<5-3,Rachel>除了圆形有鬃毛那个之外
<5-3,Rachel>except that little round one with the bristles,

159
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,950
<5-3,Rachel>因为我不知道用途为何
<5-3,Rachel>I don't know what that's for.

160
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,740
<5-4,Ross>没人知道  我们也不该问
<5-4,Ross>Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,770
<5-5,Rachel>你们感觉怎样

<5-7,Monica>...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.

164
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,460
<5-9,Monica>你怎么想这样做呢
<5-9,Monica>How-how did that happen?

165
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,230
<5-10,Rachel>我不知道  我觉得摆那儿会更好看
<5-10,Rachel>I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there.

166
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,680
<5-10,Rachel>而且这样  咖啡桌旁就多了一个座位
<5-10,Rachel>And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.

167
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,460
<5-11,Monica>是啊  这倒有意思
<5-11,Monica>Yeah, yeah, it's interesting..

168
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,280
<5-11,Monica>这样好了  只是为了好玩
<5-11,Monica>but you know what? Just for fun,

169
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,540
<5-11,Monica>我们看它在原来位置的感觉如何
<5-11,Monica>let's see what it looked like in the old spot.

170
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,850
<5-11,Monica>只是做个比较
<5-11,Monica>Alright, just to compare.

<5-11,Monica>看一下  嗯  放那儿也不错
<5-11,Monica>Let's see. Well, it looks good there too.

172
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,590
<5-11,Monica>就摆那儿一阵子吧
<5-11,Monica>Let's just leave it there for a while.

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,030
<5-12,Phoebe>我无法相信你竟敢搬动那个绿软椅
<5-12,Phoebe>I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.

174
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,290
<5-13,Chandler>幸好你没摊开摆杂志
<5-13,Chandler>Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines.

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,670
<5-13,Chandler>否则她铁定会挖出你的眼睛
<5-13,Chandler>I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.

176
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,760

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,900
<5-16,Monica>这太不公平了
<5-16,Monica>That is so unfair!

181
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,470
<5-17,Ross>拜托  我们小时候时
<5-17,Ross>Oh come on! When we were kids,

<5-19,Ross>好吧  懒女人  想像这个情况
<5-19,Ross>Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this.

186
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,650
<5-19,Ross>电话账单来了  但你不能立刻去交钱
<5-19,Ross>The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.

187
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,860
<5-20,Monica>-为什么  -因为你是个大懒人
<5-20,Monica>- Why not? - Because you're a kook!

188
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,610
<5-21,Ross>直拖到他们寄催缴通知单来
<5-21,Ross>Instead you wait until they send you a notice.

189
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,170
<5-22,Monica>我可以办到
<5-22,Monica>I could do that.

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,130
<5-24,Monica>为什么有人会那样做
<5-24,Monica>Why would someone do that?! ...

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,240
<5-24,Monica>有人会想
<5-24,Monica>One might wonder.

195
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,420
<5-25,Chandler>有人在咖啡桌上留下杯子

<5-25,Chandler>Little beads of condensation are inching their way

199
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,610
<5-25,Chandler>逐渐逼近桌面
<5-25,Chandler>closer and closer to the surface of the wood...

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,570
<6-13,Monica>她陪了你一夜
<6-13,Monica>Oh, you got the whole night, huh?

<6-14,Chandler>没错  我现在只剩20分钟了
<6-14,Chandler>Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,820
<6-14,Chandler>直到伊森过来
<6-14,Chandler>until Ethan, so, y'know..

251
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,430
<6-15,Rachel>这幽怨的语气是怎么回事
<6-15,Rachel>Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?

252
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,320
<6-16,Chandler>不是  才不是幽怨呢
<6-16,Chandler>No, no resentment,

253
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,980
<6-16,Chandler>相信我  绝对值得  好吗
<6-16,Chandler>believe me, it's worth it. OK?

254
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,370
<6-16,Chandler>当你恋爱时总有些重要时刻
<6-16,Chandler>You know in a relationship you have these key moments

255
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,210
<6-16,Chandler>会让你怀念一辈子
<6-16,Chandler>that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?

256
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,730
<6-16,Chandler>与奥萝拉相处的每一秒都是重要时刻
<6-16,Chandler>Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora..

257
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,430
<6-16,Chandler>而我已浪费了35秒
<6-16,Chandler>and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them

258
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,480
<6-16,Chandler>用于和你们说话
<6-16,Chandler>talking to you people, so, uh..

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,380
<6-16,Chandler>-莫妮卡  帮我开门  -好的
<6-16,Chandler>- Monica, can you help me with the door? - Sure.

<6-17,Monica>钱德勒  以前的莫妮卡
<6-17,Monica>Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,090
<6-17,Monica>会提醒你刷特氟隆锅时要用塑料刷
<6-17,Monica>would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush.

262
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,780
<6-17,Monica>但我不会那么做的
<6-17,Monica>But I'm not gonna do that.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,760
<7-1,Director>大家准备好没
<7-1,Director>Okay, everybody ready?

<7-2,Joey>我只是想谢谢你给我这个难得的机会
<7-2,Joey>Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.

265
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,340
<7-3,Director>解开浴袍
<7-3,Director>Lose the robe.

266
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,600
<7-5,Director>-我吗  - 是的
<7-5,Director>- Me? - That will work.

267
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,870
<7-6,Joey>好  解开浴袍
<7-6,Joey>Right. Okay. Losing the robe.

268
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,040
<7-6,Joey>浴袍已解开
<7-6,Joey>And the robe is lost.

269
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,530
<7-7,Director>各位  希望这条能一次通过  辛苦了
<7-7,Director>Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please.

270
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,600
<7-7,Director>-来吧  -放水
<7-7,Director>- Let's roll it.. - Water's working..

271
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,530
<7-7,Director>开拍
<7-7,Director>and... action.

272
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,180
<7-8,Director>停
<7-8,Director>And cut. Hey,

273
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,150
<7-8,Director>屁股男  你搞什么呢
<7-8,Director>Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?

274
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,910
<7-9,Joey>我在洗澡啊
<7-9,Joey>Well, I'm- I'm showering.

275
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,050
<7-10,Director>不  你屁股夹太紧了
<7-10,Director>No, that was clenching.

276
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,260
<7-11,Joey>我是这么想的  这个角色很沮丧
<7-11,Joey>Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know?

277
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,740
<7-11,Joey>他的太太死了  弟弟失踪了
<7-11,Joey>I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing...

278
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,460
<7-11,Joey>我想他的屁股一定很愤怒
<7-11,Joey>I think his butt would be angry here.

279
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,950
<7-12,Director>我觉得他的屁股应该想在午餐前杀青
<7-12,Director>I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch.

280
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,830
<7-12,Director>再来一次
<7-12,Director>Once again,

281
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,710
<7-12,Director>开机
<7-12,Director>rolling...

282
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,110
<7-12,Director>放水
<7-12,Director>water working...

283
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,190
<7-12,Director>开拍
<7-12,Director>and action....

284
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,020

285
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,570
<7-12,Director>你又在干什么
<7-12,Director>What was that?

286
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,650
<7-13,Joey>我要表现出绝望
<7-13,Joey>I was going for quiet desperation.

287
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,170
<7-13,Joey>但如果你想问
<7-13,Joey>But if you have to ask...

288
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,520
<8-1,Chandler>天啊我爱这些手指  谢谢
<8-1,Chandler>God, I love these fingers...

<8-3,Chandler>-谢谢  -不  我是指我的手指
<8-3,Chandler>- Thank you. - No, actually I meant my fingers.

290
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,880
<8-3,Chandler>你瞧  它们多开心
<8-3,Chandler>Look at them, look at how happy they are.

291
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,270
<8-4,Aurora>天啊  我来不及了
<8-4,Aurora>Oh my God, I'm late.

<8-5,Chandler>别呀  别呀  不要走啊
<8-5,Chandler>Oh no no no no no no no no no no, don't go..

293
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,760
<8-7,Chandler>-我真的得走  -她要走了
<8-7,Chandler>- I have to. - Look, she's leaving.

294
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,120
<8-9,Chandler>抱歉  他在等我了
<8-9,Chandler>I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

295
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,390
<8-11,Chandler>我以为  你同瑞克谈过
<8-11,Chandler>Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.

296
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,110
<8-12,Aurora>-不是瑞克  -什么  是伊森吗
<8-12,Aurora>- It's not Rick. - What, Ethan?

297
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,950
<8-13,Chandler>他居然要陪你一整天
<8-13,Chandler>He got to spend the whole day with you!

298
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,110
<8-14,Aurora>不是  是安德鲁
<8-14,Aurora>No, it's-it's Andrew.

299
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,250
<8-15,Chandler>我知道在以后很多年中我会经常后悔
<8-15,Chandler>I know there'll be many moments in the years to come

300
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,180
<8-15,Chandler>问你以下的这个问题  但是
<8-15,Chandler>when I'll regret asking the following question, but-

301
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,100
<8-15,Chandler>安德鲁是谁
<8-15,Chandler>And Andrew is?

302
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,290
<8-16,Aurora>新欢
<8-16,Aurora>He's... new.

303
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,050
<8-17,Chandler>你的意思是说
<8-17,Chandler>Oh, so what you're saying is

304
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,720
<8-17,Chandler>瑞克  伊森和我  三人还不能满足你
<8-17,Chandler>you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?

305
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,800
<8-18,Aurora>我以前不是这种人
<8-18,Aurora>No, that's not exactly what I was..

306
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,730
<8-19,Chandler>我们三人不知能迷死多少女人
<8-19,Chandler>Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.

307
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,820
<8-20,Aurora>你想要什么
<8-20,Aurora>So what do you want?

308
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,570
<8-21,Chandler>你
<8-21,Chandler>You.

309
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,500
<8-22,Aurora>你已拥有我
<8-22,Aurora>You have me!

310
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,400
<8-23,Chandler>不  只是你
<8-23,Chandler>Nono, just you

311
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,870
<8-24,Aurora>什么意思
<8-24,Aurora>What do you mean?

312
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,780
<8-25,Chandler>甩掉其他人
<8-25,Chandler>Lose the other guys.

313
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,390
<8-26,Aurora>他们全部吗
<8-26,Aurora>...Like, ...all of them?

314
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,640
<8-27,Chandler>我们这样不是很快乐吗  为什么不行
<8-27,Chandler>Come on, we're great together, why not?

315
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,730
<8-28,Aurora>我们为何不能及时行乐
<8-28,Aurora>Why can't we just have what we have now?

316
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,450
<8-28,Aurora>为何不能只是谈谈  笑笑  再做爱呢
<8-28,Aurora>Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love,

317
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,120
<8-28,Aurora>彼此没有任何负担
<8-28,Aurora>without feeling obligated to one another...

318
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,280
<8-28,Aurora>今晚之前  我以为这也是你想要的
<8-28,Aurora>and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.

319
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,980
<8-29,Chandler>部分的我想要
<8-29,Chandler>...Well, y'know, part of me wants that,

320
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,190
<8-29,Chandler>但我就像是双面人
<8-29,Chandler>but it's like I'm two guys, you know?

321
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,420
<8-29,Chandler>一个说"闭嘴  及时行乐"
<8-29,Chandler>I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!'

322
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,890
<8-29,Chandler>还有另一个
<8-29,Chandler>But there's this other guy.

323
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,860
<8-29,Chandler>他每回都会浮现出来
<8-29,Chandler>Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time

324
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,490
<8-29,Chandler>就好像圣诞怪杰的心扩大三倍
<8-29,Chandler>that Grinch's heart grows three sizes

325
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,840
<8-29,Chandler>砸掉测量计那样
<8-29,Chandler>and breaks that measuring device...

326
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,680
<8-29,Chandler>他会一直说
<8-29,Chandler>And he's saying, y'know,

327
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,010
<8-29,Chandler>"这太纠结了  停下  停下"
<8-29,Chandler>'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'

328
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,420
<8-30,Aurora>那么  你准备听从谁的话呢
<8-30,Aurora>So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?

329
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,320
<8-31,Chandler>我不知道  两人的话我得都听
<8-31,Chandler>I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them,

330
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,810
<8-31,Chandler>他们争执不休互不相让
<8-31,Chandler>they don't exactly let each other finish...

331
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,840
<8-32,Aurora>哪一个
<8-32,Aurora>Which one?

332
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,740
<8-33,Chandler>第二个
<8-33,Chandler>...The second guy.

333
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,440
<8-34,Aurora>好吧  如果你改主意了再打电话给我吧
<8-34,Aurora>Well, call me if you change your mind.

334
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,850
<8-35,Chandler>抱歉  第一个人控制了嘴巴
<8-35,Chandler>Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

335
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,180
<9-1,Ross>这样想吧  是你甩的她
<9-1,Ross>Look at it this way : you dumped her. Right?

336
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,190
<9-1,Ross>你看  这个女人无与伦比的性感
<9-1,Ross>I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy,

337
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,600
<9-1,Ross>倾国倾城  冰雪聪明  遥不可及
<9-1,Ross>and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable...

338
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,650
<9-1,Ross>再告诉我一次  你为何这么做
<9-1,Ross>Tell me why you did this again?

339
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,650
<9-3,Monica>等等  你不是那个
<9-3,Monica>Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that

340
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,940
<9-3,Monica>在阿尔·帕西诺新片中演屁股的那个人吗
<9-3,Monica>plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

341
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,900
<9-4,Joey>不是
<9-4,Joey>Nope.

342
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,410
<9-5,Ross>不是  怎么了  大个儿
<9-5,Ross>No? What happened, big guy?

343
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,330
<9-6,Chandler>大个儿
<9-6,Chandler>"Big guy?"

344
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,760
<9-7,Ross>感觉就像"大个儿"时刻
<9-7,Ross>It felt like a 'big guy'moment.

345
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
<9-8,Joey>我被开除了
<9-8,Joey>I got fired.

346
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,580
<9-9,All>没错他们说我表演太用力了
<9-9,All>Yeah, they said I acted too much with it.

347
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,470
<9-10,Joey>我之前可是满世界宣扬
<9-10,Joey>I told everybody about this!

348
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,740
<9-10,Joey>现在大家都想去电影院
<9-10,Joey>Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre,

349
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,770
<9-10,Joey>期待能看到我露面
<9-10,Joey>expecting to see me, and...

350
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,710
<9-11,Rachel>乔伊  没人会认出来的
<9-11,Rachel>Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.

351
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,560
<9-12,Joey>我妈就认得出来
<9-12,Joey>My mom will.

352
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,500
<9-13,Chandler>这感觉真温馨  又有点呕心
<9-13,Chandler>Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.

353
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,260
<9-14,Joey>六年来我除了演些烂角色一事无成
<9-14,Joey>Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years.

354
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,440
<9-14,Joey>如今机会来了  我竟将它搞砸
<9-14,Joey>And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!

355
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,370
<9-15,Monica>或许这不是你的机会
<9-15,Monica>Maybe this wasn't your shot.

356
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,250
<9-16,Ross>我的意思是
<9-16,Ross>Yeah, I mean...

357
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,420
<9-16,Ross>机会是否来临  自己最清楚
<9-16,Ross>I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot.

358
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,910
<9-16,Ross>你感觉这是你的机会吗
<9-16,Ross>Did it... feel like your shot..?

359
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,010
<9-17,Joey>很难分辨  我当时全身赤裸
<9-17,Joey>Hard to tell, I was naked.

360
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,090
<9-18,Phoebe>我不认为这是你唯一的机会
<9-18,Phoebe>No, I don't think this was your shot.

361
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,430
<9-18,Phoebe>你的机会不会只有一个
<9-18,Phoebe>I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot.

362
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,670
<9-18,Phoebe>我相信大好机会就降临到你身上
<9-18,Phoebe>I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do!

363
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,570
<9-18,Phoebe>你只要一直想着
