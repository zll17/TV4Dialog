<1-5,Chandler>Wait. What are you doing here?

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,150
<1-6,Ursula>我本来在那  然后你叫 "嗨  小姐"
<1-6,Ursula>I was over there. Then you said, "Hello,miss."

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,630
<1-6,Ursula>所以我就过来了

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,870
<1-7,Joey>不  你怎么会在这儿工作
<1-7,Joey>No, how come you're working here?

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,620
<1-7,Joey>因为这离我的住处很近
<1-7,Joey>Because it's close to where I live,

11

<1-8,Ursula>而且围裙也很漂亮

<2-1,Ross>I don't know whether he's testing me...or just acting out,

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,070
<2-1,Ross>但我的猴子已经失控了
<2-1,Ross>... but my monkey is out of control!

30
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,140
<2-1,Ross>他不断清除我答录机上的留言
<2-1,Ross>He keeps erasing the messages on my machine.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,940
<2-1,Ross>应该是个意外
<2-1,Ross>Supposedly by accident.

32

<2-2,Rachel>是啊  我做过这种事
<2-2,Rachel>Oh, yeah, I've done that.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,050
<2-3,Ross>然后他连续三天赶在我看报纸前
<2-3,Ross>And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did,

34
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,230
<2-3,Ross>在猜字游戏上尿尿
<2-3,Ross>...and peed all over the crossword!

<2-6,Joey>我看到不同之处
<2-6,Joey>I'm saying I see a difference.

<2-29,Phoebe>这只是姐妹之间的事
<2-29,Phoebe>It's mostly just dumb sister stuff.

<2-29,Phoebe>大家都认为她比我漂亮
<2-29,Phoebe>Everyone always thought of her as the pretty one.

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,250
<2-29,Phoebe>对我爸妈而言那就已经不新鲜了
<2-29,Phoebe>But to my parents, by then it was, "Yeah, what else is new?"

00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,180
<10-8,Chandler>她根本记不得被开除这件事
<10-8,Chandler>...she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.

249
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,380
<10-10,Chandler>-难以置信  -你不得不信
<10-10,Chandler>- That's unbelievable. - And yet believable.

250
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,410
<10-10,Chandler>因此我决定不再开除她
<10-10,Chandler>So I decided not to fire her again

251
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,730
<10-10,Chandler>直到她对自己和他人不构成威胁为止
<10-10,Chandler>until she'll be no threat to herself or others.

252
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,320
<10-11,Mr. Douglas>看来人们永远无法了解他人心中所想
<10-11,Mr. Douglas>I guess you never know what's going on inside a person's head.

253
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,850
<10-12,Chandler>我想这就是"心理学"名字的由来  先生
<10-12,Chandler>Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.

254
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,960
<11-1,Soothing male voice>爸妈永远忘不了这声音
<11-1,Soothing male voice>The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

255
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,350

<11-1,Soothing male voice>For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.

<11-6,Carol>I am not doing that. It'll just have to stay in.

262
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,150
<11-6,Carol>一切和原来一样  他得留在我体内
<11-6,Carol>Everything will be the same. It'll just stay in.

263
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,180
<11-7,Ross>卡罗尔  亲爱的  不会有事的
<11-7,Ross>Carol, honey, it'll be all right.

264
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,150
<11-7,Ross>你知道什么
<11-7,Ross>What do you know?

265
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,260
<11-8,Carol>又没人问你,
<11-8,Carol>No one's asking you,

266
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,440
<11-8,Carol>"我能将这肉块穿过你的鼻孔吗"
<11-8,Carol>"Mind if we push this pot roast through your nostril?"

267
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,730
<11-9,Susan>卡罗尔  亲爱的  深呼吸
<11-9,Susan>Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.

268
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,260
<11-10,Susan>我知道你很惶恐  往长远想
<11-10,Susan>I know it's frightening. But big picture:

269
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,980
<11-10,Susan>生产过程只是一天
<11-10,Susan>The birth part is just one day.

270

<12-3,Ross>-你才刚知道  -我一直都知道要有孩子了
<12-3,Ross>- This is news to you? - I knew I was having a baby.

275

<12-3,Ross>只是没意识到要担起父亲的责任
<12-3,Ross>I just never realized the baby was having me.

276

<12-5,Ross>-你会是个好爸爸的  -你怎会知道
<12-5,Ross>- You'll be great. - How can you say that?

277
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,630
<12-5,Ross>我连阻止马塞尔吃浴垫都办不到
<12-5,Ross>I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.

<12-11,Phoebe>能问你一个问题吗
<12-11,Phoebe>Can I just ask you one question?

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,320
<12-14,Joey>你是指性吧  对吧
<12-14,Joey>You meant sex, right?

<13-3,Nina>还怪怪地看我
<13-3,Nina>and giving me these really strange looks.

291
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,670
<13-4,Chandler>或许是因为他们在嫉妒我们
<13-4,Chandler>Well, maybe that's because they're jealous of us.

292
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,970
<13-5,Nina>或许吧  但他们为何拿走我的剪刀
<13-5,Nina>Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.

293
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,890
<13-6,Chandler>或许是因为你被升职的缘故
<13-6,Chandler>Maybe that's because you're getting a big raise!

299
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,380
<13-11,Helen>你还要我拿她的心理状况档案到人事部吗
<13-11,Helen>You still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?

303
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,020
<14-2,Rachel>她的反应如何
<14-2,Rachel>How'd she take it?

304
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,250
<14-3,Chandler>还不错  除了拿钉书机钉我之外
<14-3,Chandler>Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.

305
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,830
<14-3,Chandler>提示一下  以后遇见类似的状况
<14-3,Chandler>A tip. If you're ever in a similar situation...

306
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,700
<14-3,Chandler>切记别把手放在桌上
<14-3,Chandler>... never, ever leave your hand on the desk.

<14-5,Phoebe>让这个画面消失  我实在看不下去
<14-5,Phoebe>Make them go away because I can't watch.

312
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,750
<14-9,Phoebe>还不是厄休拉惹的祸
<14-9,Phoebe>It's just this whole stupid Ursula thing.

313
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,590
<14-10,Rachel>菲比  我冒昧问下...

<14-11,Phoebe>她总是弄坏我的东西
<14-11,Phoebe>She's just always breaking my stuff.

318
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,660
<14-11,Phoebe>我8岁时不肯让她玩我的卡通水杯
<14-11,Phoebe>When I was 8, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos,

319
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,780
<14-11,Phoebe>她把它扔到公车下
<14-11,Phoebe>so she threw it under the bus.

320
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,090
<14-11,Phoebe>然后  还有个蓝迪·布朗  就像
<14-11,Phoebe>And then there's Randy Brown, who was like

321
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,840
<14-11,Phoebe>你们有没有异性好友变成男友的情况
<14-11,Phoebe>Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend?

<14-13,Phoebe>她把他抢走又伤了他的心
<14-13,Phoebe>And she kind of stole him away and then broke his heart.

324
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,760
<14-13,Phoebe>他从此不和我说话
<14-13,Phoebe>Then he wouldn't talk to me anymore.

325
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,760
<14-13,Phoebe>因为他说他不愿再见像她的人
<14-13,Phoebe>He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.

326
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,960
<14-15,Phoebe>我知道乔伊不是我男朋友或者水杯
<14-15,Phoebe>I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos...

327
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,740
<14-15,Phoebe>或其他的什么  但是

<14-19,Ross>-说得轻巧  -别这样  他又不知道这些
<14-19,Ross>-Yeah. - Come on, he didn't know these staff.

330
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,170
<14-20,Phoebe>-如果他知道你的感受  -但他爱上她了
<14-20,Phoebe>- lf he knew how you felt - But he's falling in love with her.

331

<14-21,Rachel>拜托  他们才约会一个星期
<14-21,Rachel>Please. They've been going out a week.

<14-21,Rachel>根本还没上床  关系还没确定下来
<14-21,Rachel>They haven't even slept together yet. That's not serious.
