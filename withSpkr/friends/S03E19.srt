6

<1-3,Gunther>或者我们改天一起去吃饭
<1-3,Gunther>"Maybe you'd just like to get something to eat with me sometime...

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,010
<1-3,Gunther>以情侣的身份

<1-7,Rachel>好吧  你说

<1-8,Mark>I've kind of had this crush on you.

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,720
<1-8,Mark>但以前你跟罗斯在一起  我就没有表白
<1-8,Mark>But, since you were with Ross, I didn't do anything about it.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,970
<1-8,Mark>但既然你们分手了  我真的想约你出去
<1-8,Mark>But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,550

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,180
<2-1,Pete>你可以说"去洗车"  "去打扫房间"
<2-1,Pete>You know, so you could be, like, "Wash my car." "Clean my room."

34
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,980
<2-1,Pete>电脑办不到这些
<2-1,Pete>It's not gonna be able to do any of those things,

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,830
<2-1,Pete>但是听得懂
<2-1,Pete>but it'll understand what you're saying.

<2-11,Monica>He's so funny and so sweet.

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,040
<2-11,Monica>而我对他没半点兴趣
<2-11,Monica>And I'm not attracted to him at all!

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,610
<2-12,Ross>-还没兴趣吗  -没有

<4-4,Rachel>我跟他说我会考虑  但是我会拒绝

91
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,110
<4-6,Rachel>我想现在我会拒绝任何人
<4-6,Rachel>I think I'd say no to anybody right now.

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,360
<4-6,Rachel>好奇怪  这样一个
<4-6,Rachel>But it was so strange. I mean, I 'm standing there with this

<4-6,Rachel>which I'm allowed to do and I felt guilty,

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,410
<4-6,Rachel>仿佛那样是背叛罗斯似的
<4-6,Rachel>You know like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

96
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,030
<4-7,Phoebe>也许这代表  你还没对罗斯忘情
<4-7,Phoebe>Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that you're not over Ross yet

97
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,770
<4-7,Phoebe>而且还有恋父情结
<4-7,Phoebe>and you have issues with your father.

98
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,490
<4-8,Rachel>我没有恋父情结
<4-8,Rachel>I don't have issues with my father.

99
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,230
<4-9,Phoebe>那可能只是罗斯的问题了

<5-1,Joey>我恨这个女人  我恨她

111
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,390
<5-6,Ross>发现没有我的人生

<6-17,Ross>不  不必假好心
<6-17,Ross>No, you know, don't do me any favors.

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,170
<6-17,Ross>我想问  我的其它东西呢

<6-18,Rachel>你根本没穿过
<6-18,Rachel>You never even wear that T-shirt.

<6-19,Ross>我是在帮你往前走
<6-19,Ross>I'm just trying to help you "move on."

144
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,360
<6-20,Rachel>你真小气
<6-20,Rachel>Oh, you are a petty man.

147
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
<6-26,Rachel>你这么做就是为了泄愤
<6-26,Rachel>You are so just doing this out of spite.

148

<6-29,Ross>才不是  我会一直穿着  我爱这件衣服
<6-29,Ross>No no no, I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!

<6-32,Rachel>你15岁后就没穿过了
<6-32,Rachel>You haven't worn that T-shirt since you were 15!

150
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,510
<6-32,Rachel>根本塞不下
<6-32,Rachel>It doesn't even fit you anymore!

154
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,560
<6-35,Ross>然后穿着我最爱的衣服  去放松一下
<6-35,Ross>and "relax"...in my favorite shirt.

155
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,800
<6-35,Ross>祝你今晚愉快

<7-1,Phoebe>这么说  你是亿万富翁
<7-1,Phoebe>So you're, like, a zillionaire.

157
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,450
<7-2,Chandler>却跟我们差不多大  差不多大啊
<7-2,Chandler>And you're our age. You're our age.

158
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,120
<7-3,Phoebe>知道吗  你应该买下一个州
<7-3,Phoebe>You know what? You should buy a state...

159
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,000
<7-3,Phoebe>然后用你的名字给它命名
<7-3,Phoebe>and then just name it after yourself.

160
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,770
<7-4,Pete>比如"彼特达科他州"
<7-4,Pete>Like, "Pete Dakota"?

161
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,630
<7-5,Phoebe>或是"密西西彼特州"
<7-5,Phoebe>Or "Mississi-Pete."

162
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,460
<7-6,Joey>我想到了  "彼芝加哥"
<7-6,Joey>I got it: "Pete Chicago."

163
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,220
<7-7,Chandler>芝加哥不是州  乔伊
<7-7,Chandler>That's not a state, Joe.

164
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,210
<7-8,Joey>那"密西西彼特"就是吗
<7-8,Joey>Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

165
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,300
<7-9,Pete>我该走了  改天见
<7-9,Pete>I gotta go. So I'll see you guys later.

<7-11,Chandler>-好的  -你居然跟我们差不多大
<7-11,Chandler>-Ok. - You're our age.

<7-12,Pete>-那我们明天照旧  -好的
<7-12,Pete>- So are we on for tomorrow? - Absolutely.

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,450
<7-13,Monica>快走吧
<7-13,Monica>Now, get out of here, you!

169
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,620
<7-13,Monica>我快要没地方可以摸了
<7-13,Monica>Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him.

170
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,400
<7-13,Monica>我是有什么毛病吗
<7-13,Monica>Is something wrong with me?

171
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,930
<7-13,Monica>为何我总是喜欢与之没有未来的人
<7-13,Monica>Why am I only attracted to guys with there's no future?

172
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,630
<7-13,Monica>不是太老  就是太小
<7-13,Monica>Either they're too old, or they're too young.

173
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,600
<7-13,Monica>而彼特这么喜欢我
<7-13,Monica>And there's Pete, who's crazy about me......

174
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,500
<7-13,Monica>又这么完美  我却一点感觉也没有
<7-13,Monica>and he's absolutely perfect, and there's zip going on!

175
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,230
<7-13,Monica>真的  你们觉得我是不是有什么毛病
<7-13,Monica>Seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?

176
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,470
<7-13,Monica>好像是有点
<7-13,Monica>Yeah, kind of.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,360
<8-1,Kate>开心  我应该感到开心吗  维克
<8-1,Kate>Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be, Vic?

178
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,020
<8-1,Kate>开心
<8-1,Kate>Happy?

179
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,450
<8-2,Joey>不如你来告诉我你该有什么感觉
<8-2,Joey>Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be?

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,600
<8-2,Joey>因为我实在搞不懂
<8-2,Joey>Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!

181
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,140
<8-2,Joey>我们的交谈没有感情
<8-2,Joey>I talk to you, and nothing!

182
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,610
<8-2,Joey>你看着我的眼神没有感情
<8-2,Joey>You look at me, and it's nothing!

183
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,050
<8-2,Joey>一点都没有
<8-2,Joey>Nothing.

184
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,490
<8-3,The Director>有意思
<8-3,The Director>Tasty.

185
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,820
<8-3,The Director>我开始觉得你们有渊源了  很好
<8-3,The Director>I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's nice.

186
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,290
<8-4,Kate>-我对这场戏有个疑问  -怎样
<8-4,Kate>- I have a question about this scene. - Yes?

187
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,180
<8-6,Kate>我不理解爱德莉安为什么会喜欢维克多
<8-6,Kate>I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

188
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,260
<8-7,The Director>抽丝剥茧
<8-7,The Director>Peel the onion.

189
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,760
<8-7,The Director>首先  他很帅
<8-7,The Director>First of all, he's good-looking.

190
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,170
<8-9,Kate>我的角色需要更好的理由
<8-9,Kate>I think my character needs a little bit more of a reason than that.

191
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,760
<8-10,Joey>我来告诉你个理由  因为剧本这么写的
<8-10,Joey>Hey, how about this one? It says so in the script!

192
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,530
<8-10,Joey>我也不明白我的角色为什么喜欢你
<8-10,Joey>You know I don't know why my character likes you either.

193
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,370
<8-10,Joey>剧本上说你是个贱人
<8-10,Joey>I mean, it says in the script here that you're a bitch.

194
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,520
<8-11,Kate>-剧本上没写  -我这本有
<8-11,Kate>- It doesn't say that in the script. - It does in mine.

195
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,450
<9-1,Chandler>我吹干  上发胶  还是一样
<9-1,Chandler>I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter.

196
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,330
<9-1,Chandler>头顶上还是有一撮
<9-1,Chandler>I still wind up with this little...

197
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,580
<9-1,Chandler>梳不平的头发  烦死人了
<9-1,Chandler>cowlick-y thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,630
<9-2,Ross>-你看了烦不烦  -你比较烦
<9-2,Ross>- Does it bug you? - You bug me.

199
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,430
<9-3,Chandler>你会不会刚好没看到
<9-3,Chandler>Is there any chance you didn't see that?

200
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,150
<9-3,Chandler>罗斯  别再看了
<9-3,Chandler>Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

201
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,390
<9-3,Chandler>你不能在猫眼那儿瞄上三小时
<9-3,Chandler>You can't just stare through the peephole for three hours.

202
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,400
<10-1,Chandler>你会得偷窥眼的
<10-1,Chandler>You're gonna get peep-eye.

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,390
<10-2,Ross>我就知道  我就知道她喜欢他
<10-2,Ross>I knew it. I knew it. I always knew she liked him.

204
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,080
<10-2,Ross>她一直否认  结果呢
<10-2,Ross>She'd say no,but here we are.

205
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,710
<10-2,Ross>我们才刚分手  她就变心了
<10-2,Ross>We just broke up, first thing she does!

206
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,890
<10-4,Ross>-你们可不是"才刚"分手  -才三个星期
<10-4,Ross>- You didn't "just break up." - It's been, like, three weeks!

207
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,230
<10-5,Chandler>你跟她分手后不到三小时就跟别人上床了
<10-5,Chandler>You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.

208
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,290
<10-5,Chandler>连子弹出膛都没这么快
<10-5,Chandler>I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

209
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,030
<10-6,Ross>他们回来了  他们
<10-6,Ross>Here they come! Here they...

210
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,920
<10-6,Ross>要是她跟他吻别  我发誓我会自杀的
<10-6,Ross>If she kisses him good night, I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.

211
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,540
<10-6,Ross>我看不下去了
<10-6,Ross>I can't watch.

212
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,150
<10-6,Ross>约会该结束了  该结束了
<10-6,Ross>Come on. Date over! Date over!

213
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,330
<10-6,Ross>-没事  她要进去了  -好的
<10-6,Ross>- Here we go. She's going in. - Okay.

214
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,850
<10-8,Ross>她要进去了
<10-8,Ross>She's going in.

215
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,030
<10-8,Ross>等等  他也要进去了
<10-8,Ross>Wait! He's going in!

216
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,040
<10-8,Ross>他进去了  门关了
<10-8,Ross>He's going in!The door's closed!

217
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,950
<10-8,Ross>门关着我什么都看不到
<10-8,Ross>I can't see anything with the door closed!

218
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,770
<10-9,Chandler>门的发明者可以安息了
<10-9,Chandler>And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.

219
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,850
<10-10,Ross>我得想个办法  我得阻止他们
<10-10,Ross>I have to do something. I have to stop it!

220
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,190
<10-11,Chandler>-阻止什么  -我不知道
<10-11,Chandler>- Stop what? - I don't know.

221
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,180
<10-12,Ross>但我觉得我到他们屋里就想明白了
<10-12,Ross>But I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it.

222
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,730
<10-12,Ross>我要过去借东西  果汁  我要喝果汁
<10-12,Ross>I'll go over and I will borrow something! Juice! I need juice!

<10-15,Chandler>我是你的朋友  我不会让你这么做的
<10-15,Chandler>I am your friend and I am not gonna let you do this!

<10-15,Chandler>你还真强壮
<10-15,Chandler>You are surprisingly strong!

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,570
<10-20,Ross>她放下过去了
<10-20,Ross>She's moving on. Okay?

231
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,340
<10-21,Chandler>就算不是他也会有别人
<10-21,Chandler>If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

232
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,570
<10-21,Chandler>除非你打算租下这个猫眼
<10-21,Chandler>And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole...

233
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,600
<10-21,Chandler>否则你就得
<10-21,Chandler>you're gonna have to get used to

234
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,100
<10-21,Chandler>面对分手的事实
<10-21,Chandler>the fact that the relationship is over!

<10-24,Ross>I know.

240
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,030
<11-1,Mark>咖啡杯底为什么都有编号
<11-1,Mark>Why do your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?

241
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,640
<11-2,Rachel>这样莫妮卡才方便追踪
<11-2,Rachel>Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,870
<11-2,Rachel>要是少了一个
<11-2,Rachel>That way if one of them's missing,

243
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,750
<11-2,Rachel>她就可以说  "27号杯呢"
<11-2,Rachel>she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

244
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,070
<11-4,Mark>-你知道吗  -不知道  也不想知道
<11-4,Mark>- You know what?- No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.

245

<11-7,Rachel>马克  我的出发点是错的
<11-7,Rachel>Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,050
<11-7,Rachel>我只是想报复罗斯
<11-7,Rachel>I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,790
<11-7,Rachel>对不起  这样对你不公平
<11-7,Rachel>I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

254
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,700
<11-9,Rachel>很抱歉
<11-9,Rachel>I'm sorry about this.

255
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,150
<11-10,Mark>没关系

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,710
<12-1,Spokeswoman>...它将成为21世纪的青霉素
<12-1,Spokeswoman>...and should become the penicillin of the 21st century.

259
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,580
<12-1,Spokeswoman>所以今天  本院将迈出领导改革的
<12-1,Spokeswoman>And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps...

260
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,780
<12-1,Spokeswoman>关键一步
<12-1,Spokeswoman>toward leading that revolution.

261
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,710
<12-2,Pete>问你一件事
<12-2,Pete>Can I ask you something?

262
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,570
<12-4,Pete>目前是什么状况
<12-4,Pete>Where are we?

263
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,260
<12-5,Monica>有这么多医生和护士在场
<12-5,Monica>Well, with all these doctors and nurses...

264
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,270
<12-5,Monica>应该是侏儒马术表演
<12-5,Monica>I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo."

265
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,430
<12-6,Pete>跟我说实话
<12-6,Pete>Just tell me the truth.

266
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,970
<12-6,Pete>好吧
<12-6,Pete>OK.

267
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,870
<12-7,Monica>我应该没有告诉你  但是
<12-7,Monica>You know, I don't think I told you this but...

268
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,340
<12-7,Monica>我刚结束一段很认真的感情
<12-7,Monica>I just recently got out of a really serious relationship.

269
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,610
<12-8,Pete>那不是都一年前的事了吗
<12-8,Pete>Oh, right. Wasn't that a year ago?

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,770
<12-9,Monica>原来我说过了
<12-9,Monica>So I did tell you.

271
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,630
<12-9,Monica>其实不是这个原因
<12-9,Monica>Okay, you know? That's not really the thing.

272
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,940
<12-9,Monica>原因是目前
<12-9,Monica>The thing is that right now

273
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,100
<12-9,Monica>我只想把注意力放在自己身上
<12-9,Monica>I'm just in a place in my life where I just need to focus on me.

274
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,210
<12-10,Pete>-你懂吗  -我懂
<12-10,Pete>- Do you know what I mean? - Oh, I know what are you mean.

275
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,810
<12-11,Monica>我也想对你有兴趣
<12-11,Monica>I so want to be attracted to you.

276
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,190
<12-12,Pete>但是你没有  好了  没事
<12-12,Pete>But you're not. Okay. Good.

277
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,170
<12-13,Monica>对不起
<12-13,Monica>I'm sorry.

278
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,840
<12-14,Pete>知道吗  不必抱歉
<12-14,Pete>You know what, don't be, it's not,

279
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,190
<12-14,Pete>不必抱歉  没有那么糟
<12-14,Pete>don't be, because it's not so bad.

280
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,890
<12-15,Monica>真的
<12-15,Monica>It's not?

281
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,630
<12-16,Pete>我又不是约翰·邦乔维(摇滚明星)
<12-16,Pete>Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

282
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,800
<12-16,Pete>或是对你有吸引力的人
<12-16,Pete>Or someone you find attractive.

283
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,450
<12-16,Pete>我只是觉得
<12-16,Pete>I just think, you know...

284
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,360
<12-16,Pete>你的感觉或许会变
<12-16,Pete>that you might end up feeling differently.

285
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,210
<12-17,Monica>你别误会  但是
<12-17,Monica>I don't want this to come out wrong but...

286
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,300
<12-17,Monica>以被拒绝的人来说
<12-17,Monica>you seem awfully confident for a guy

287
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,740
<12-17,Monica>你还真有自信
<12-17,Monica>I just told I wasn't attracted to.

288
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,820
<12-18,Pete>傻得很可爱吧
<12-18,Pete>Stupidly charming, isn't it?

289
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,270
<12-18,Pete>要不要去吃饭
<12-18,Pete>Listen, let's... You wanna get something to eat?

290
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,270
<12-18,Pete>这里太令人沮丧了
<12-18,Pete>This place is kind of depressing.

291
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,900
<12-19,Spokeswoman>我们欢迎幕后功臣
<12-19,Spokeswoman>Now the man who made all of this possible,

292
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,450
<12-19,Spokeswoman>彼特·贝克先生
<12-19,Spokeswoman>Mr. Peter Becker.

293
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,260
<12-20,Pete>等一下
<12-20,Pete>One second.

294
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,640
<13-1,Chandler>一山不容二虎
<13-1,Chandler>I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.

295
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,470
<13-1,Chandler>拔枪
<13-1,Chandler>Draw!

296
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,040
<13-2,Chandler>我什么也没做
<13-2,Chandler>I wasn't doing anything.

297
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,590
<13-2,Chandler>她又怎么了
<13-2,Chandler>What did she do now?

298
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,460
<13-3,Joey>她不过在耶鲁大学读过戏剧系
<13-3,Joey>Just because she went to Yale drama,

299
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,230
<13-3,Joey>就自以为是有史以来最伟大的女演员
<13-3,Joey>she thinks she's like the greatest actress...since sliced bread.

300
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,780
<13-4,Chandler>切片面包啊  她演的麦克白夫人是一绝
<13-4,Chandler>Ah, Sliced Bread. A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

<13-5,Joey>老天  我恨她  我恨她成天
<13-5,Joey>God. I hate her. I hate her with her

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,540
<13-5,Joey>"我好有才华"
<13-5,Joey>"Oh, I'm so talented"...

304
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,860
<13-5,Joey>还有"我好漂亮"  "我好香"
<13-5,Joey>and "Oh, I'm so pretty," and "Oh, I smell so good."

305
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,360
<13-6,Chandler>我看有某人动了心哦
<13-6,Chandler>I think somebody has a crush on somebody.

306
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,750
<13-7,Joey>钱德勒  请专心讨论我的问题好吗
<13-7,Joey>Chandler can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?

<13-8,Chandler>我就是说你  猪头
<13-8,Chandler>I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,470
<13-9,Joey>别说疯话
<13-9,Joey>You're out of your mind!

309
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,950
<13-10,Chandler>这两天你开口闭口都是她
<13-10,Chandler>You've done nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours.

310
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,940
<13-10,Chandler>要是你还是学生
<13-10,Chandler>If you were in school,

311
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,790
<13-10,Chandler>你早就在拉她的辫子  推倒她了
<13-10,Chandler>you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.

312
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,560
<13-11,Joey>是吗  那为什么我老是想着
<13-11,Joey>Oh yeah? Then how come I keep thinking about her...

313
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,590
<13-11,Joey>跟她在各种场景中嘿咻呢
<13-11,Joey>in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?

<13-11,Joey>不如你来告诉我你该有什么感觉
<13-11,Joey>Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be, huh?

316
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,420
<13-11,Joey>因为我实在搞不懂
<13-11,Joey>Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

317
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,900
<13-11,Joey>我们的交谈没有感情
<13-11,Joey>I talk to you, and it's nothing.

318
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,130
<14-1,Kate>你看着我的眼神没有感情
<14-1,Kate>You look at me, and nothing.

319

<14-2,Joey>一点都没有

338
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,770

<15-1,Phoebe>Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

339
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,920
<15-1,Phoebe>像是高德曼  西尔弗曼
<15-1,Phoebe>Like Goldman, Silverman?

340
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,530
<15-2,Chandler>因为那不是他的姓
<15-2,Chandler>Because it's not his last name.

341
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,570
<15-4,Chandler>-不是吗  -他又不叫
<15-4,Chandler>- It isn't? - No, it's not, like...

<15-4,Chandler>He's a Spider-man.

344
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,230
<15-4,Chandler>比如说
<15-4,Chandler>You know, like

345
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,690
<15-4,Chandler>像高德曼是姓氏  但是没有金人
<15-4,Chandler>Goldman is a last name. But there's no Gold Man.

346
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,040
<15-4,Chandler>好吧
<15-4,Chandler>Okay.

347
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,300
<15-5,Phoebe>应该有金人的
<15-5,Phoebe>There should be a Gold Man!

348
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,890
<15-7,Monica>瑞秋

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,890
<15-9,Monica>对了  罗斯拿了一盒你的东西来
<15-9,Monica>By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.

352
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,140
<15-10,Rachel>意料之中的事
<15-10,Rachel>Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.

353
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,720
<15-10,Rachel>直接扔掉吧  还不是洗发水还有...
<15-10,Rachel>I'm just gonna throw it out. It's probably just shampoo and...

354
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,330
<15-11,Monica>怎么了
<15-11,Monica>Something wrong?

356
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,340
<16-1,Chandler>那么  "金人"有什么超能力
<16-1,Chandler>So what kind of powers would "Gold Man" have?

357
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,340
<16-2,Phoebe>他能把东西变成金子
<16-2,Phoebe>Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.

358
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,680
<16-3,Chandler>-已经是金子的东西呢  -那他就不用变了
<16-3,Chandler>- What about things that are already gold? - His work is done.

359
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,870
<16-5,Chandler>-来玩我的游戏吧  -好
<16-5,Chandler>- Okay. Let's play my game now. - Okay.

360
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,300
<16-6,Phoebe>你这个胆小如鼠的懦夫
