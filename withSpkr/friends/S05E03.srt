<4-14,Chandler>你一直提到的这位方奇
<4-14,Chandler>This Fonzie person you keep referring to...

<4-18,Phoebe>怪得不得了
<4-18,Phoebe>It's very weird!

<4-18,Phoebe>我才不要听某人告诉我
<4-18,Phoebe>I don't want some guy down there telling me

130
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,540
<4-19,Ross>说句公道话  他可没有模仿方奇
<4-19,Ross>To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...

131
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,900
<4-19,Ross>你在干什么
<4-19,Ross>What are you doing?

132
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,750
<4-20,Phoebe>干嘛替他辩解  帮我再找一位医生
<4-20,Phoebe>Why are you defending him? Just get me another doctor.

133
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,870
<4-20,Phoebe>没有发疯的  也不是方奇的医生
<4-20,Phoebe>One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!

134
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,640
<4-21,Ross>其实他不是...
<4-21,Ross>Again, it's not he...

135
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,130
<5-1,Chandler>嘿  你在这里
<5-1,Chandler>Hey, there you are!

137
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,700
<5-3,Chandler>是你要跟护士约会的事吗  我听乔伊说了
<5-3,Chandler>Is this about you dating the nurse? Joey told me.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,400
<5-3,Chandler>我一点也不在意  你和我又没什么
<5-3,Chandler>I am so fine. You and I, we're just nothing.

139
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,270
<5-3,Chandler>我们只是玩玩
<5-3,Chandler>Just goofing around.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,950
<5-4,Monica>其实我是想告诉你  我不打算去
<5-4,Monica>Acutally, I was about to tell you I was going to get out of it.

141
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,080
<5-4,Monica>既然我们只是"玩玩"
<5-4,Monica>But if we're just "goofing around,"

142
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,010
<5-4,Monica>那我就跟他出去好了
<5-4,Monica>then maybe I will go out with him.

143
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,340
<5-5,Chandler>好  也许我也会
<5-5,Chandler>Fine. Maybe I will too.

147
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,230
<6-1,Ross>他对方奇及其他《欢乐时光》人物
<6-1,Ross>He has no strong feelings about Fonzie...

148
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,530
<6-1,Ross>都没什么感觉
<6-1,Ross>...or any of the Happy Days gang.

149
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,600
<6-2,Phoebe>你好  你要升几年级了
<6-2,Phoebe>Hi. You're going into what grade?

150
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,310

<6-3,Dr. Oberman>I'm actually a first-year resident. I got that a lot.

<6-3,Dr. Oberman>我提前毕业了

<6-4,Phoebe>Ross,

154
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,620
<6-4,Phoebe>或许我应该强调  我是要成年的医师
<6-4,Phoebe>maybe I should have specified I'd need a grown-up doctor.

155
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,020
<6-5,Dr. Oberman>我绝对有能力...
<6-5,Dr. Oberman>Really, I'm fully qualified...

156
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,280

157
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,160
<6-6,Phoebe>到底有没有人了解我快生了
<6-6,Phoebe>Does anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon?

<6-7,Frank>崔比安尼先生  你有肾结石
<6-7,Frank>Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,850
<7-1,Joey>有别的可能吗
<7-1,Joey>Well, what else could it be?

162
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,090
<7-1,Joey>就是肾结石
<7-1,Joey>It's kidney stones.

163
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,090
<7-2,Joey>或是
<7-2,Joey>Or...

164
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,950
<7-2,Joey>肾结石
<7-2,Joey>Kidney stones.

165
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,940
<7-2,Joey>差不多了
<7-2,Joey>You're getting there.

166
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,340
<8-1,Dr. Harad>这些宝宝非常非常幸运
<8-1,Dr. Harad>You know these babies are very, very lucky.

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,640
<8-2,Phoebe>是吗  为什么
<8-2,Phoebe>They are? Why?

168
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,440
<8-3,Dr. Harad>他们的生日日期是方子的一半
<8-3,Dr. Harad>They have the honor be born on the Fonz's half-birthday.

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,450
<8-5,Dr. Harad>我不是方奇
<8-5,Dr. Harad>...I'm not Fonzie.

00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,070
<8-6,Rachel>说真的  你能为你弟弟两口子
<8-6,Rachel>I just need to tell you I think it's such a terrific thing that

173
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,640
<8-6,Rachel>生孩子真是太了不起了
<8-6,Rachel>you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.

174
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,500
<8-7,Phoebe>是啊  的确
<8-7,Phoebe>No, it is.

175
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,210
<8-9,Phoebe>-我可以告诉你一个秘密吗  -说吧
<8-9,Phoebe>- Can I tell you a secret? - Yeah.

176
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,110
<8-10,Rachel>我想自己留一个
<8-10,Rachel>I want to keep one.

177
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,990
<8-12,Rachel>天哪  我会上新闻的
<8-12,Rachel>Oh, I'm gonna be on the news.

178
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,470
<9-1,Rachel>菲比  别开玩笑了
<9-1,Rachel>Phoebe, honey, you got be kidding.

179
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,970
<9-1,Rachel>你明知你不能这么做
<9-1,Rachel>You know you can't keep one of these babies.

180
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,940
<9-2,Phoebe>为什么不行  也许我可以  你怎么知道
<9-2,Phoebe>Why not? Maybe I can. You don't know.

181
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,270
<9-3,Rachel>我当然知道
<9-3,Rachel>Yes, yes, I do. I do know.

182
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,170
<9-3,Rachel>弗兰克和爱丽丝他们一定三个都要
<9-3,Rachel>Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all their children.

183
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,850
<9-2,Phoebe>不一定  知道吗
<9-2,Phoebe>Maybe not. You know?

184
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,240
<9-4,Phoebe>说真的  三个宝宝太多了
<9-4,Phoebe>Seriously, three babies are a handful.

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,270
<9-4,Phoebe>也许他们正想找机会摆脱掉一个
<9-4,Phoebe>Maybe they're looking a chance to unload one of them.

186
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,520
<9-4,Phoebe>我不想因为没开口而失去机会
<9-4,Phoebe>I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.

187
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,950
<9-5,Rachel>菲比  不行  这太疯狂了
<9-5,Rachel>Phoebe, no. This is insane.

188
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,290
<9-6,Phoebe>你就问问看嘛
<9-6,Phoebe>Just ask him.

189
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,190
<9-7,Rachel>什么  我
<9-7,Rachel>What? Me?

190
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,820
<9-8,Phoebe>我不能去问他
<9-8,Phoebe>I can't ask him!

191
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,230
<9-8,Phoebe>你知道那样多不成体统吗
<9-8,Phoebe>Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?

192
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,070
<9-8,Phoebe>总之你去找弗兰克谈
<9-8,Phoebe>All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank, okay?

193
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,640
<9-8,Phoebe>探探他的口风
<9-8,Phoebe>Just feel him out.

194
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,440
<9-9,Rachel>不行  我不会叫弗兰克给你一个孩子的
<9-9,Rachel>No forget it. I'm not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids.

195
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,370
<9-10,Phoebe>你说得对
<9-10,Phoebe>You're right.

196
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,820
<9-11,Phoebe>就说是你要的
<9-11,Phoebe>Tell him it's for you.

197
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,790
<10-1,Monica>好一点了吗  亲爱的
<10-1,Monica>Feeling better, sweetie?

198
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,760
<10-2,Joey>一点点吧
<10-2,Joey>Maybe a little.

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,760
<10-2,Joey>真希望你没看到我吐
<10-2,Joey>Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

200
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,530
<10-3,Monica>我也希望
<10-3,Monica>Me too.

201
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,140
<10-4,Ross>我刚刚听说  怎么回事
<10-4,Ross>I just heard. What's up?

202
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,240
<10-4,Ross>肾结石
<10-4,Ross>Kidney stones!

203
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,090
<10-4,Ross>通常  崔比安尼先生
<10-4,Ross>Ordinarily, Mr Tribbiani,

204
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,480
<10-4,Ross>我们会用冲击波震碎结石
<10-4,Ross>we try to break the stones up with shock waves.

205
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,120
<10-4,Ross>但你的结石太靠近膀胱了
<10-4,Ross>But they're too close to the bladder now.

206
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,470
<10-5,Joey>所以要么等你排出体外
<10-5,Joey>Which means we can either wait for you to pass them

207
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,350
<10-5,Joey>要么从尿道往上...
<10-5,Joey>or else go up the urethra...

208
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,600
<10-5,Joey>不行不行  不能往上  明白吗
<10-5,Joey>No, no, no, no. Nothing is going up, okay? Up...

209
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,500
<10-5,Joey>绝对不考虑往上  尿道是什么
<10-5,Joey>Up is not an option. What's a urethra?

210
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,830
<10-5,Joey>你疯了吗
<10-5,Joey>Are you crazy?

211
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,030
<11-1,Phoebe>你问他了吗
<11-1,Phoebe>Did you ask him?

212
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,140
<11-2,Rachel>我还没有机会跟他独处
<11-2,Rachel>No, I haven't had a chance be alone with him yet.

213
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,010
<11-3,Phoebe>我的时间有限
<11-3,Phoebe>I'm kind of on a clock here.

214
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,510
<11-4,Dr. Harad>哦  方奇
<11-4,Dr. Harad>Oh, Fonzie.

215
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,390
<11-5,Rachel>你知道我一直喜欢谁吗  默克
<11-5,Rachel>You know who I always liked? Mork.

217
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,520
<11-6,Phoebe>收回收回
<11-6,Phoebe>Undo it. Undo it.

218
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,500
<11-7,Dr. Harad>方奇遇见默克
<11-7,Dr. Harad>Fonzie met Mork.

219
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,730
<11-7,Dr. Harad>默克把方奇冻住了
<11-7,Dr. Harad>Mork froze Fonzie.

220
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,370
<23-8,All>是的
<23-8,All>Yeah.

221
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,880
<11-8,Rachel>是的  但是
<11-8,Rachel>Yes, but...

222
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,650
<11-8,Rachel>但是方奇本来就很酷(冷)
<11-8,Rachel>Fonzie was already cool.

223
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,210
<11-8,Rachel>所以他不会有事  对吧
<11-8,Rachel>So he wasn't hurt. Right?

224
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
<11-9,Dr. Harad>也对
<11-9,Dr. Harad>Yeah, that's right.

225
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,040

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,300
<11-14,Frank>你能不能帮个忙  先憋住
<11-14,Frank>You couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
