<6-2,Joey>but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.

139
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,090
<6-3,Chandler>乔伊有一套严格的筛选过程
<6-3,Chandler>Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process.

140
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,130
<6-3,Chandler>并非每个人都适合拥有木制品
<6-3,Chandler>Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.

141
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,960
<6-4,Phoebe>别挣扎了
<6-4,Phoebe>Stop it!

142
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,970

<6-5,Ross>I'm not sure.

145
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,410
<6-6,Phoebe>可能直到  她能接受我有了
<6-6,Phoebe>I guess until she gets used to the fact that there's...

146
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,950
<6-6,Phoebe>新妈妈
<6-6,Phoebe>...a new mom.

147
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,880
<6-6,Phoebe>她会很担心自己被取代
<6-6,Phoebe>Now she's worried that she'll be replaced.

148
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,780
<6-6,Phoebe>才不会  对不对
