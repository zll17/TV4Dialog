<1-20,MONICA>不是  我说的是奇异果派  那样味道才特别
<1-20,MONICA>No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.

48
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,800
<1-21,ROSS>那样才会置我于死地
<1-21,ROSS>That's what's gonna kill me.

<3-1,PHOEBE>你不能把粉笔擦掉的
<3-1,PHOEBE>You know, you can't just erase chalk.

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,970
<3-3,PHOEBE>那他干脆给她一个宝座  一顶皇冠
<3-3,PHOEBE>Why doesn't he just give her a throne and a crown?

129

<3-26,MONICA>...if there's any way to treat this orally?

169
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,920
<3-27,DOCTOR>没有  在这种情况之下  打针是难免的

170
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
<3-27,DOCTOR>而且要马上打针

<4-24,JOEY>我们得确定正面代表什么
<4-24,JOEY>We have to assign heads to something!

266
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,190
<4-25,CHANDLER>好的
<4-25,CHANDLER>Right!

267
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,800
<4-26,JOEY>鸭子是正面[头]   因为鸭子有头

<5-5,RACHEL>看看你  收获真不少
<5-5,RACHEL>Look at you! You did pretty well.

278
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,850
<5-5,RACHEL>八块两毛七
<5-5,RACHEL>$8.27.

279
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,950
<5-6,PHOEBE>其实没那么多  头两块是我放的
<5-6,PHOEBE>But not really, because I put in the first two.

280
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,060
<5-6,PHOEBE>只是让钱滚滚来  还有让自己舒服一点
<5-6,PHOEBE>Just to get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better.

281
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,010
<5-7,RACHEL>结果呢
<5-7,RACHEL>Do you?

282
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,290
<5-8,PHOEBE>没有  为钱弹唱这种事太不适合我了
<5-8,PHOEBE>No. You know, this whole playing for money thing is so not good for me.

283
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,010
<5-8,PHOEBE>我不知道  当我唱到  自自自杀
<5-8,PHOEBE>I don't know, when l sang "Su-su-suicide"...

284
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,910
<5-8,PHOEBE>得了一块七毛五
<5-8,PHOEBE>... I got, like, $1.75.

285
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,980
<5-8,PHOEBE>可唱到臭臭猫呢
<5-8,PHOEBE>But then "Smelly Cat"?

286
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,510
<5-8,PHOEBE>别人给了我两毛五跟一个保险套
<5-8,PHOEBE>I got 25 cents and a condom.

287
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,740
<5-8,PHOEBE>所以现在我为臭臭猫感到很难过
<5-8,PHOEBE>So, you know, now I just feel really bad for "Smelly Cat."

288
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,740
<5-9,RACHEL>我不认为大家都会懂臭臭猫
<5-9,RACHEL>Honey, I don't think everybody gets "Smelly Cat."

289
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,580
<5-9,RACHEL>如果你只要养过健康的宠物  那肯定一头雾水
<5-9,RACHEL>I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

290
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,190
<5-10,PHOEBE>可根本就不是那么回事
<5-10,PHOEBE>But it's not even that, you know?

291
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,880
<5-10,PHOEBE>本来我唱歌只是因为我很高兴
<5-10,PHOEBE>I used to do my songs because it made me happy.

292
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,230
<5-10,PHOEBE>可是现在却全都是为了赚钱
<5-10,PHOEBE>Now it's just all about the money, you know?

293
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,490
<5-11,RACHEL>菲比  大家都很想你
<5-11,RACHEL>Well, people missed you in there.

294
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,420
<5-11,RACHEL>事实上  还有人指名要听臭臭猫呢
<5-11,RACHEL>In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."

295
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,950
<5-12,PHOEBE>真的吗  是谁
<5-12,PHOEBE>Really? From who?

296

<5-13,RACHEL>我知道那不是你最好卖的歌  但我最喜欢那首
<5-13,RACHEL>And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.

298
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,570
<5-14,KID>我是不是不小心丢了一个保险套
<5-14,KID>Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case?

299
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,660
<5-14,KID>情况有点紧急
<5-14,KID>It's kind of an emergency.

<5-22,MONICA>那我用西尔维安的南瓜打你脸那次呢
<5-22,MONICA>What about the time I hit you in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

308
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,690
<5-23,ROSS>天啊  记得我拿扫把插进你自行车轮胎里
<5-23,ROSS>Man. Remember when I stuck that broom in your spokes...

309
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,040
<5-23,ROSS>结果你翻车头撞到路边那次吗
<5-23,ROSS>...and you hit your head on the curb?

310
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,370
<5-24,MONICA>不记得了  可我记得别人告诉过我
<5-24,MONICA>No. But I remember people telling me about it.
