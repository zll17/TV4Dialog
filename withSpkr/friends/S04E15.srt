11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,560
<1-4,Rachel>这样无损于你男子气概的
<1-4,Rachel>This doesn't make you any less of a guy.

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,250
<1-4,Rachel>但那样会

<2-1,Monica>Joey, let me ask you a question.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,120
<2-1,Monica>我快被这问题逼疯了
<2-1,Monica>It's been driving me crazy.

35
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,230
<2-1,Monica>这个开关是干嘛用的
<2-1,Monica>What does this light switch do?

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,170
<2-3,Monica>你不知道它是干嘛的
<2-3,Monica>Didn't it drive you crazy

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,560
<2-3,Monica>不会很伤脑筋吗
<2-3,Monica>to have a switch and not know what it did?

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,810
<2-4,Joey>我知道啊  它没用
<2-4,Joey>I know what it did. Nothing.

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,380
<2-5,Monica>没用就不会装在这里了
<2-5,Monica>They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something!

41
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,170
<2-5,Monica>你怎么能不在意
<2-5,Monica>How can you not care?

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,930
<2-29,Chandler>我受不了那女人
<2-29,Chandler>I can't stand the woman!

62
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,850
<2-30,Phoebe>什么  我还以为你爱死她了
<2-30,Phoebe>What? I thought you were crazy about her!

63
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,220
<2-31,Chandler>但我们相爱前
<2-31,Chandler>But you know all those annoying things

64
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,670
<2-31,Chandler>她所有讨人厌的小毛病

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,060
<2-31,Chandler>她的声音  笑声和个性
<2-31,Chandler>Her voice, her laugh and her personality?

<2-31,Chandler>全都回来了
<2-31,Chandler>They're all back!

67
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,950
<2-31,Chandler>而且还多了起码九种新毛病
<2-31,Chandler>And she's picked up, like, nine new ones!

68
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,670
<2-32,Joey>那你干嘛带她来  虐待我们啊
<2-32,Joey>Why'd you bring her here? There's people here!

<2-33,Chandler>放心  我今晚会搞定
<2-33,Chandler>Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.

70
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,070
<2-34,Rachel>才怪  你一直跟她纠缠不清
<2-34,Rachel>You are not! You have never been able to break up with her.

<2-34,Rachel>这次我不必跟她分手
<2-34,Rachel>I don't have to break up with her this time.

<2-35,Chandler>我们还没开始交往呢  我会先发制人
<2-35,Chandler>We're not involved. I'll do a preemptive strike.

73
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,130
<2-35,Chandler>将我俩的感情扼杀在摇篮里
<2-35,Chandler>I'll end it with her before it starts.

74
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,630
<2-35,Chandler>我的屁股冷酷如冰  毫无激情
<2-35,Chandler>My ass is, like, frozen!

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,390
<2-36,Joey>塞进冷冻库20分钟试试看
<2-36,Joey>Try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,850
<2-36,Joey>信不信由你
<2-36,Joey>I'm telling you!

<4-7,Devon>我们从U2演唱会之后
<4-7,Devon>Do you realize, we have not seen each other

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,500
<4-7,Devon>就没见过面
<4-7,Devon>since the night of that U2 concert.

92
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,560
<4-8,Emily>天哪  没错
<4-8,Emily>Oh, my God. You're right.

<4-9,Liam>Actually, the last time you and I saw each other

94
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,300
<4-9,Liam>应该是演唱会后第二天早上

<4-11,Ross>你们喜欢踢足球吗
<4-11,Ross>So were you guys playing soccer?

98
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,770
<4-11,Ross>或者说是英式足球
<4-11,Ross>Or should I call it "football"?

99
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,450
<4-12,Devon>我们打英式橄榄球
<4-12,Devon>We were playing rugby.

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,600
<4-13,Liam>其实明天就有球赛
<4-13,Liam>In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow.

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,070
<4-13,Liam>欢迎你也来参加
<4-13,Liam>You're welcome to play too if you want.

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,850
<4-14,Emily>罗斯打橄榄球  算了吧
<4-14,Emily>Ross play rugby? I don't think so.

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,610
<4-15,Ross>有什么可笑的
<4-15,Ross>What's so funny about that?

104
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,420
<4-16,Emily>首先  你是个美国人
<4-16,Emily>Well, you're American to start with.

105
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,110
<4-16,Emily>你们压根不玩橄榄球
<4-16,Emily>You don't have rugby here.

106
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,940
<4-17,Ross>我们这里在1776年以前  还没有自由呢
<4-17,Ross>Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776 either, so...

110
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,090
<5-2,Chandler>我知道你喜欢
<5-2,Chandler>Yes, I know that you do.

111
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,150
<5-2,Chandler>而现场其他人之所以怨声载道
<5-2,Chandler>but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though...

112
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,280
<5-2,Chandler>是因为他们以前是要花钱
<5-2,Chandler>is because most people paid to hear the actor

113
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,840
<5-2,Chandler>才能听演员唱《老人河》呢
<5-2,Chandler>sing "Old Man River".

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,530
<5-3,Janice>看看我们

<5-3,Janice>Who would've thought Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails?

116
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,750
<5-4,Chandler>我们得谈谈
<5-4,Chandler>Okay, we have to talk.

117
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,950
<5-4,Chandler>我刚结束了一段很认真投入的恋情
<5-4,Chandler>I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,040
<5-5,Janice>我知道  而我刚结束一段婚姻
<5-5,Janice>I know. And I'm just getting out of a marriage.

119
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,060
<5-5,Janice>这就叫作"三生注定"
<5-5,Janice>Talk about "meant to be."

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,700
<5-6,Chandler>对  但我觉得进展太快了
<5-6,Chandler>Right. But I just think this is happening too soon.

121
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,120
<5-7,Janice>什么太快  哪里快了
<5-7,Janice>Oh, too soon, too schmoon!

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,230
<5-12,Janice>什么时候
<5-12,Janice>When?

138
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,760
<5-13,Chandler>还没定
<5-13,Chandler>I don't know exactly.

139
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,820
<5-14,Janice>那我只能如胶似漆地缠着
<5-14,Janice>Well, I will just have to soak up every ounce...

140
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,030
<5-14,Janice>钱德勒·宾  直到那一刻来临
<5-14,Janice>of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.

141
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,480
<5-15,Chandler>但明天我肯定要走
<5-15,Chandler>But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,270
<6-2,Phoebe>-好了  -对
<6-2,Phoebe>- Done? - Yep!

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,180
<6-4,Joey>怎么了
<6-4,Joey>What's up?

144
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,680
<6-5,Monica>这个开关快把我逼疯了
<6-5,Monica>This switch thing is driving me crazy.

145
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,340
<6-5,Monica>所以我关掉开关  检查了每个插座
<6-5,Monica>So, I turned it off and checked every outlet.

146
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,600
<6-5,Monica>有四个不能用
<6-5,Monica>Four don't work,

147
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,850
<6-5,Monica>说明其中一个由它控制
<6-5,Monica>which means one of them has to controlled by the switch.

148
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,300
<6-5,Monica>所以  我在那四个插座上
<6-5,Monica>So, I plugged in things

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,550
<6-5,Monica>都插上了能发声的东西
<6-5,Monica>in all four of the outlets that-that make noise.

150
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,430
<6-5,Monica>到时候一开开关  我就顺着声音去找
<6-5,Monica>That way, when I turn it on, I just follow the noise.

151
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,010
<6-5,Monica>就知道开关控制的是哪个插座了
<6-5,Monica>And find out which one of them it is.

152
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,640
<6-6,Joey>我肯定会比你先放弃
<6-6,Joey>I bet I stopped listening before you did.

153
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,770
<6-7,Rachel>其实你可以插电灯的...
<6-7,Rachel>You know, you also could have used lamps...

154
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,360
<6-7,Rachel>然后看哪里亮起来了
<6-7,Rachel>and followed the light.

155
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,800
<6-8,Monica>可我要喜欢顺着声音找
<6-8,Monica>Yeah, well, I'm using noise.

156
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,090
<6-8,Monica>好了  大家准备好了吗
<6-8,Monica>All right! So, is everybody ready?

157
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,700
<6-8,Monica>开始了
<6-8,Monica>Here we go!

158
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,920
<6-8,Monica>有声音  我听到了  在哪里
<6-8,Monica>Something. I hear something. Where is it?

159
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,960
<6-9,Rachel>是乔伊发出来的
<6-9,Rachel>It's coming from Joey!

160
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,130
<6-10,Phoebe>天哪  好诡异  快把他关掉
<6-10,Phoebe>Oh, my God! That's so freaky! Turn him off!

161
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,150
<7-1,Phoebe>可以看新闻吗
<7-1,Phoebe>Ooh, hey, could we put on the news?

162
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,530
<7-1,Phoebe>外面可能会下雨
<7-1,Phoebe>I think it might be raining.

163
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,900
<7-2,Ross>稍等一下
<7-2,Ross>Oh, just hold on a second.

164
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,740
<7-2,Ross>我在看ESPN转播的橄榄球赛
<7-2,Ross>I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.

166
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,920
<7-2,Ross>有什么了不起啊
<7-2,Ross>I don't know what the big deal is.

167
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,140
<7-2,Ross>我也是个男人  这我也能打
<7-2,Ross>I'm man enough to play this sport.

168
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,200
<7-3,Joey>你是男人
<7-3,Joey>Dude, you're not even man enough

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,390
<7-3,Joey>可你连运动频道都没订
<7-3,Joey>to order the channel that carries the sport.

170
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,300
<7-4,Janice>你好  罗斯
<7-4,Janice>Hey there, Ross!

172
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,310
<7-7,Chandler>你真的不必帮我收拾行李
<7-7,Chandler>You know, you really didn't have to help me pack.

173
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,640
<7-8,Janice>是你说  你出发之前的时间
<7-8,Janice>when you said all you were going to be doing

<7-8,Janice>都得用来收拾行李
<7-8,Janice>between now and the time you leave is packing,

175
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,660
<7-8,Janice>我还有什么选择呢
<7-8,Janice>you really didn't leave me much choice, did you?

176
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,300
<7-9,Chandler>我以为有很多东西  不过看来没多少
<7-9,Chandler>I thought I did, but I guess I did not.

177
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,720
<7-10,Joey>怎么回事

179
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,050
<7-11,Chandler>是因为我明天要去也门
<7-11,Chandler>cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

180
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,130
<7-12,Joey>多谢你告诉我啊
<7-12,Joey>Thanks for telling me!

181
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,730
<7-13,Chandler>我是假装要去也门
<7-13,Chandler>I'm only pretend to moving to Yemen,

182
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,010
<7-13,Chandler>好摆脱她
<7-13,Chandler>it's the only way I can get rid off her.

183
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,230
<7-13,Chandler>好主意
<7-13,Chandler>Good one!

184
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,070
<7-14,Joey>也门  真会编  听起来还真像个国家名呢
<7-14,Joey>Yemen! That actually sounds like a real country!

<7-14,Joey>钱德勒  快来

187
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,030
<7-15,Janice>可以节省空间
<7-15,Janice>It's a real space-saver.

188
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,650
<7-16,Phoebe>我知道  不过我那样做是想显得高一点
<7-16,Phoebe>Yeah, I know, I do that because it makes me look taller.

189
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,250
<7-17,Janice>钱德勒  来啊
<7-17,Janice>Chandler! Come on!

<7-18,Chandler>-乔伊  跟我交换人生  -不要
<7-18,Chandler>- Joey, trade lives with me. - Nope.

191
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,440
<7-19,Joey>天呐  罗斯
<7-19,Joey>Man look at this! Ross,

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,290
<7-19,Joey>你居然要打橄榄球
<7-19,Joey>I can't believe you said you'd play rugby.

193
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,540
<7-19,Joey>这种运动多野蛮
<7-19,Joey>I mean look how brutal this is!

194
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,480
<7-20,Ross>我没问题的  相信我
<7-20,Ross>Hey, I can handle it! All right?

195
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,420
<7-21,Rachel>拜托  罗斯  你跟我爸打羽毛球都会受伤
<7-21,Rachel>Please, Ross. You got hurt playing badminton with my dad.

196
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,070
<7-22,Ross>那是因为你妈的狗一直瞪着我
<7-22,Ross>That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.

197
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,180
<7-23,Joey>罗斯  你看  看这里
<7-23,Joey>Okay, Ross, look, look right here.

198
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,340
<7-23,Joey>这个叫作"并列争球"
<7-23,Joey>That's called a scrum, okay?

199
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,770
<7-23,Joey>一堆人挤作一团抢球
<7-23,Joey>It's like a huddle.

200
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,430
<7-24,Ross>不就是个球吗  有什么好抢的
<7-24,Ross>And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?

201
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,470
<7-25,Joey>罗斯  他们会要了你命的
<7-25,Joey>Ross, they're going kill you!

202
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,490
<7-26,Phoebe>你到底为什么要打橄榄球啊
<7-26,Phoebe>Why are you doing this, anyway?

203
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,820
<7-27,Ross>你们应该看看她以前交往的人
<7-27,Ross>You should've seen the guys she used to go out with.

204
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,460
<7-27,Ross>那人活像颗"巨型橄榄球"
<7-27,Ross>He's like "Joe Rugby"!

205
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,510
<7-28,Phoebe>"巨型橄榄球"打橄榄球  好搞笑
<7-28,Phoebe>You're kidding! And he plays rugby? That's funny!

206
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,590
<7-28,Phoebe>我懂你的意思了  是比喻
<7-28,Phoebe>Oh, I see. You did that.

207
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,310
<7-29,Ross>总之  她觉得我和那个男的
<7-29,Ross>Anyway, she thought the very idea of

208
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,120
<7-29,Ross>一起打橄榄球很好笑
<7-29,Ross>me playing rugby with him was like hilarious.

209
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,480
<7-29,Ross>所以我要证明我有多猛
<7-29,Ross>So I'll show her how tough I really am.

210
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,670
<7-30,Rachel>对不起  你说得对  你是很猛
<7-30,Rachel>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy.

211
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,790
<7-30,Rachel>你是我认识最猛的古生物学家
<7-30,Rachel>The toughest paleontologist just I know.

212
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,230
<7-31,Joey>没问题啦  罗斯会照顾好自己的
<7-31,Joey>All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself!

213
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,250
<7-31,Joey>他又不是...钱德勒
<7-31,Joey>It's not like he's...Chandler!

214
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,190
<7-32,Chandler>谢了
<7-32,Chandler>Thanks.

215
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,180
<7-32,Chandler>别替我担心
<7-32,Chandler>Don't worry about me.

216
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,820
<7-33,Ross>我会装得很有冲劲  跟球保持距离
<7-33,Ross>I'll just look real energetic and stay away from the ball.

217
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,120
<7-33,Ross>我会学那个人  站在圈外
<7-33,Ross>I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.

218
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,770
<7-35,Rachel>也许有狗在瞪着他
<7-35,Rachel>Maybe there was a dog looking at him.

219
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,880
<8-1,Joey>罗斯  别靠近那个  那个还有那个人
<8-1,Joey>Ross, stay away from that guy and that guy and that one...

220
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,790
<8-1,Joey>他们都好壮
<8-1,Joey>Dude, they're all huge!

221
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,820
<8-2,Ross>又没比我壮
<8-2,Ross>They don't look any bigger than me!

222
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,250
<8-3,Joey>可能因为你离自己比较近
<8-3,Joey>Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you.

223
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,110
<8-3,Joey>所以觉得自己比较壮
<8-3,Joey>So you look bigger to you from where you are.

224
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,220
<8-4,Emily>我去跟他们打个招呼
<8-4,Emily>I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?

227
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,710
<8-9,Ross>我知道怎么办了
<8-9,Ross>Okay, I know what I have to do.

228
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,460
<8-9,Ross>我要变成"赤面罗斯"
<8-9,Ross>I've got to go Red Ross.

229

<8-10,Joey>Totally don't know what you are talking about.

<8-11,Ross>有人插队  我不是就抓狂了
<8-11,Ross>and that one guy cut in front of us and I just lost it?

234
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,460
<8-11,Ross>破口大骂  脸都涨红了
<8-11,Ross>Screamed at him, turned all red!

235

250
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,690
<10-3,Rachel>不过我给他挑袖扣  顺便摸了他的脉搏
<10-3,Rachel>But I was showing him some cuff links, and I felt his pulse.

<10-7,Rachel>Okay, should I be scared?

255
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
<10-7,Rachel>那个开关一定是有什么用的
<10-7,Rachel>I know that switch is gonna do something, okay?

256
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
<10-8,Monica>这是去市政府调的
<10-8,Monica>So I went down to city hall and got these.

257
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,310
<10-8,Monica>只花了25元  排了3小时队
<10-8,Monica>All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.

258
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,970
<10-9,Rachel>还好知道的人不多
<10-9,Rachel>Wow! If only more people knew!

259
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,820
<11-1,Chandler>你实在不必送我来机场
<11-1,Chandler>You really didn't have to take me to the airport.

260
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,190
<11-2,Janice>拜托  每分每秒都很珍贵
<11-2,Janice>Oh, please. Every moment is precious.

261
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
<11-2,Janice>而且总得有人搭乘另一辆出租车
<11-2,Janice>Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi

262
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,410
<11-2,Janice>帮你看着另一半行李吧
<11-2,Janice>with the rest of your luggage

263
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,430
<11-2,Janice>你的那些朋友好像
<11-2,Janice>And your friends don't seem to care very much

264
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,710
<11-4,Janice>根本不在乎你离开似的
<11-4,Janice>that you're leaving.

265
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,940
<11-3,Chandler>其实我们关系不是很好
<11-3,Chandler>We're not really that close.

266
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,540
<11-3,Chandler>好  我们就此告别吧
<11-3,Chandler>Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.

267
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,900
<11-3,Chandler>不
<11-3,Chandler>Oh, no!

268
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,190
<11-4,Janice>我才不走  我会一直陪到你上飞机为止
<11-4,Janice>It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving till you get on that plane.

269
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,260
<11-5,Chandler>好  那就"请在此等候"
<11-5,Chandler>Okay. Well, I guess it's just "wait here" then.

270
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,590
<11-5,Chandler>我要一张去也门的假机票
<11-5,Chandler>I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

271
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,590
<11-6,Ticket Counter Attendant>一张去也门的机票吗
<11-6,Ticket Counter Attendant>One ticket?

272
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,130
<11-7,Chandler>我只需要一张假机票
<11-7,Chandler>I just need a pretend ticket.

273
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,780
<11-8,Ticket Counter Attendant>抱歉  先生  我不太明白
<11-8,Ticket Counter Attendant>I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.

274
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,450
<11-9,Chandler>小孩想要张票玩的时候
<11-9,Chandler>What would you give to a kid

275
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,900
<11-9,Chandler>你会给他什么
<11-9,Chandler>if he wanted a ticket to play with?

276
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,610
<11-10,Ticket Counter Attendant>您带了小孩子一起坐飞机吗
<11-10,Ticket Counter Attendant>Are you traveling with a child?

277
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,570
<11-10,Ticket Counter Attendant>没有
<11-10,Ticket Counter Attendant>No.

278
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,050
<11-11,Chandler>她会以为我在拿信用卡给你
<11-11,Chandler>She'll think I'm handing you a credit card.

279
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,550
<11-11,Chandler>其实我给你的是借书证
<11-11,Chandler>But what I'll really hand you is a library card.

280
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,650
<11-12,Ticket Counter Attendant>去也门的机票2100美元
<11-12,Ticket Counter Attendant>Sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100,

281
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,210
<11-12,Ticket Counter Attendant>而且我们不收借书证
<11-12,Ticket Counter Attendant>and we don't take library cards.

282
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,220
<11-13,Janice>怎么了  有什么问题吗
<11-13,Janice>What's the matter? Is something wrong?

283
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,850
<11-13,Janice>你要去不成了吗
<11-13,Janice>Do you have to stay?

284
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,900
<11-14,Chandler>美国运通卡收吗
<11-14,Chandler>American Express?

285
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,350
<12-1,Emily>他们怎么这样
<12-1,Emily>I can't believe they're doing that to him!

286
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,150
<12-1,Emily>我明明叫他们手下留情
<12-1,Emily>I told them to go easy on him!

287
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,470
<12-2,Phoebe>我没别的意思
<12-2,Phoebe>No offense, but sometimes it's hard

288
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,630
<12-2,Phoebe>但有时你的口音的确很难懂
<12-2,Phoebe>to understand you, you know, with the accent.

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,040
<12-3,Emily>才上半场结束  还有下半场
<12-3,Emily>That's just halftime. There's more of this.

290
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,600
<12-4,Ross>你们看到了吗
<12-4,Ross>Did you see me?

291
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,630
<12-4,Ross>我玩得真好  好过瘾的球赛
<12-4,Ross>I was pretty good. That is one fun game!

292
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,620
<12-6,Ross>帮个忙
<12-6,Ross>Could you do me a favour?

293
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,260
<12-6,Ross>请帮我拿瓶水好吗
<12-6,Ross>Just grab me a bottle of water?

294
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,020
<12-7,Emily>谢谢
<12-7,Emily>Thanks!

295
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,100
<12-8,Ross>我觉得我快死了  真的
<12-8,Ross>I think I'm dying. I really do.

296
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,990
<12-9,Phoebe>真可怜
<12-9,Phoebe>Poor baby!

297
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,740
<12-10,Ross>告诉我儿子我爱他
<12-10,Ross>Tell my son that I love him.

298
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,910
<12-10,Ross>太好了  我还要再打个过瘾
<12-10,Ross>Excellent! Got to have some more fun!

299
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,000
<12-11,Emily>罗斯  你快被整死了
<12-11,Emily>They are killing you out there.

300
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,460
<12-12,Ross>乱讲
<12-12,Ross>That's not true.

301
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,570
<12-13,Phoebe>她说得对  你不能再打了
<12-13,Phoebe>She's right. You have to stop!

302
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,690
<12-14,Ross>不行  我是赤面罗斯
<12-14,Ross>No! I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!

303
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,450
<12-15,Joey>你再上场会变成死面罗斯了
<12-15,Joey>Dude, you go back out there, you'll be Dead Ross.

304
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,820
<12-16,Ross>我绝不退场
<12-16,Ross>I don't care, I'm not quitting.

305
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,510
<12-16,Ross>我要坚持到底
<12-16,Ross>I'm going to finish this game.

306
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,440
<12-17,Emily>如果你一定要打
<12-17,Emily>All right, all right, if you insist on doing this,

307
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,610
<12-17,Emily>至少让我帮帮忙吧
<12-17,Emily>at least let me help you.

308
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,020
<12-18,Ross>不行  这可不是女人玩的
<12-18,Ross>No, God no! That is no place for a woman.

309
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,590
<12-18,Ross>那些人什么都抓
<12-18,Ross>Those guys will grab anything.

310
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,100
<12-19,Emily>我不是要上场
<12-19,Emily>No. That's not what I'm saying.

311
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,630
<12-19,Emily>我只是想告诉你
<12-19,Emily>I just may know a few things

312
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,930
<12-19,Emily>怎样让别人受伤
<12-19,Emily>that might help you inflict some pain.

313
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,810
<12-20,Ross>这个我喜欢
<12-20,Ross>I like that.

314
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,020
<12-21,Emily>听好了
<12-21,Emily>Listen closely.

315
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,390
<12-21,Emily>戴文的脚踝很弱
<12-21,Emily>Devon has got a weak ankle.

316
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,800
<12-23,Emily>踢一下就会倒
<12-23,Emily>One swift kick and he'll back off.

317
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,900
<12-24,Ross>踢脚踝  明白
<12-24,Ross>Bad ankle. Got it!

318
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,080
<12-25,Emily>那个落腮胡的大个子  髋部受过伤
<12-25,Emily>And that big bloke with the beard? He's got a trick hip.

319
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,940
<12-25,Emily>那个大卫  听说没戴护膝
<12-25,Emily>And David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.

320
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,500
<12-26,Ross>明白了  髋部不好  没穿护膝  没问题
<12-26,Ross>I could use that. Trick hip, no cup. Okay!

321
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,920
<12-27,Emily>还有连恩  他膝盖不好
<12-27,Emily>And Liam's got bad knees.

322
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,170
<12-27,Emily>看准地方下手  一撞就倒
<12-27,Emily>You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.

323
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,260
<12-28,Ross>但是连恩是我队友
<12-28,Ross>But Liam's on my team.

324
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,120
<12-29,Emily>-我不管  你去宰了他  -宰了他
<12-29,Emily>- I don't care. You just get him! - Go and get him!

325
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,760
<12-30,Ross>我要回场上了
<12-30,Ross>I am going back in!

326
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,390
<12-31,Joey>真的是赤面罗斯
<12-31,Joey>Red Ross! Yeah!

327
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,800
<13-3,Rachel>这些是什么
<13-3,Rachel>What are these?

328
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,580
<13-4,Monica>我画了一些画挂起来
<13-4,Monica>Just some pictures I made and hung up.

329
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,760
<13-4,Monica>这下客厅更漂亮了
<13-4,Monica>I thought they'd brighten up the place.

330
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,330
<13-4,Monica>不觉得吗
<13-4,Monica>They do don't you think?

331
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,550
<13-5,Monica>别别别
<13-5,Monica>No-no-no, no!

332
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,700
<13-6,Monica>那里没有洞
<13-6,Monica>I know there's no hole there.

333
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,480
<13-6,Monica>我只是很喜欢那幅画
<13-6,Monica>I just really like that picture.

334
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,610
<13-7,Rachel>天哪  你看
<13-7,Rachel>Oh, my God! Look at this!

335
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,700
<13-8,Monica>那开关后面有线
<13-8,Monica>Okay, but there is a wire back there!

336
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,490
<13-8,Monica>肯定连着什么地方
<13-8,Monica>I mean that switch is connected to something!

337
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,850
<13-9,Rachel>我才不在乎  这些线已经让你脑子短路了
<13-9,Rachel>I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!

338
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,380
<13-10,Monica>我只想沿着电线顺藤摸瓜
<13-10,Monica>I just thought that if I could follow the wire

339
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,190
<13-10,Monica>找出开关的功用
<13-10,Monica>I could find out what it did.

340
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,350
<13-11,Rachel>那你找到了吗
<13-11,Rachel>And did you?

341
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,260
<13-11,Rachel>没有
<13-11,Rachel>No.

342
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,840
<13-12,Monica>线走到那层夹板后面就消失了
<13-12,Monica>It disappears back there behind that baseboard.

343
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,060
<13-13,Monica>跟凯卓奇斯太太打个招呼吧
<13-13,Monica>Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.

344
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,160
<13-15,Mrs. Chatracus>亲爱的  你好啊
<13-15,Mrs. Chatracus>Hello, darling.

<13-16,Rachel>Hey, Mrs. Catrokis, do you know Kenny?

347
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,750
<13-16,Rachel>你不是开玩笑吧...
<13-16,Rachel>You've got to be kidding...

348
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,760
<14-1,Phoebe>你真的不去看医生吗
<14-1,Phoebe>Are you sure you don't want go and see a doctor?

349
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
<14-2,Ross>不要  那样多丢人啊
<14-2,Ross>No, that'll just bring me down!

350
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,500
<14-2,Ross>太棒了  我太厉害了  今天真过瘾
<14-2,Ross>This was great! I was great! This was a great day!

351
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,740
<14-2,Ross>我请大家喝咖啡
<14-2,Ross>You know what, I'm buying everyone coffee.

<14-2,Ross>帮我拿皮夹  在我的口袋里
<14-2,Ross>Can someone just grab my wallet. It's in my pocket.

<14-4,Ross>-没问题  -没说你
<14-4,Ross>- Yeah, sure. - No, not you.

354
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,710
<14-5,Joey>你的眼睛还有些肿
<14-5,Joey>Your eye's still popping out a little there.

355
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,820
<14-5,Joey>我去拿冰块
<14-5,Joey>I'll go get some ice.

<14-6,Phoebe>冰块  我正想吃冰块
<14-6,Phoebe>Ice, yeah! I'm so in the mood for ice.

357
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,810
<14-7,Emily>你刚才好神勇
<14-7,Emily>You were amazing out there.

358
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,550
<14-8,Ross>确实蛮神勇的吧
<14-8,Ross>I kind of was, wasn't I?

359
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,740
<14-9,Emily>老天啊
<14-9,Emily>Oh, my God!

360
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,350
<14-10,Ross>我让一个壮我两倍的人哭了
<14-10,Ross>I made a man twice my size cry!

361
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,350
<14-10,Ross>上一次干出这种事还是4岁的时候
<14-10,Ross>I haven't done that since I was 4

362
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,950
<14-10,Ross>那次我用石头洗我爸的宝时捷
<14-10,Ross>and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

363
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,390
<14-11,Emily>你真的打得很过瘾  对不对
<14-11,Emily>You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

364
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,820
<14-12,Ross>开玩笑  我干掉三个大块头
<14-12,Ross>Please, are you kidding? I hurt three huge men.

365
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,900
<14-12,Ross>还让一个人流鼻血
<14-12,Ross>I gave a guy a bloody nose!

366
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,460
<14-12,Ross>虽说这没什么好得意的
<14-12,Ross>I'm not proud of it...

367
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,210
<14-12,Ross>不过  我真的好得意
<14-12,Ross>but I really am!
