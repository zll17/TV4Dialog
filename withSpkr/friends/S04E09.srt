00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,370
<9-22,Ross>上次在船上是何时

259
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,220
<10-2,Monica>亚利山多洛斯的老板上门来骂我
<10-2,Monica>Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me,

260
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,140
<10-2,Monica>但我乘势帮他做了酱料
<10-2,Monica>but instead I made him some sauce,

261
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,980
<10-2,Monica>结果他挖我去店里做主厨
<10-2,Monica>and he offered me the job as head chef!!

262
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,010

<10-9,Rachel>穿上这套装如何
<10-9,Rachel>. . .on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

269
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,210
<10-10,Phoebe>我不知道  那完全要看她的肤色而定
<10-10,Phoebe>I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and

270
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,250
<10-11,Rachel>你被录取啦

<10-13,Rachel>还有全套装潢的私人办公室
<10-13,Rachel>I'll have an office with walls and everything.

<10-14,Phoebe>菲比  我有话要跟你说
<10-14,Phoebe>I kind of need to talk to you about that.

278
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,050
<10-15,Monica>我想宴会的事不能操之过急
<10-15,Monica>Well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.

279
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,120
<10-16,Phoebe>但我们才刚做了一笔生意
<10-16,Phoebe>But we've only had one job.

280
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,420
<10-17,Monica>我知道  但现在有第二笔了
<10-17,Monica>I know. But now we have this second one,

281
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,860
<10-17,Monica>就像雪球越滚越大
<10-17,Monica>and it feels like it's snowballing.

282
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
<10-18,Phoebe>你在说什么
<10-18,Phoebe>What are you saying?

285
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,540
<10-21,Monica>不碍事的  其实仔细想想
<10-21,Monica>It's okay, 'cause y'know what? If you think about it,

286
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,640
<10-21,Monica>你不是很需要我
<10-21,Monica>You don't really need me for the business.

287
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,400
<10-22,Phoebe>你是厨师啊
<10-22,Phoebe>You're the cook!

288
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,540
<10-22,Phoebe>总不能我自己一个开去别人家
<10-22,Phoebe>Without you, it's just me driving up to people's houses...

289
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,610
<10-22,Phoebe>带着空盘子就跟人要钱吧
<10-22,Phoebe>...with empty trays, asking for money.

299
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,280
<11-6,Joey>我们才不需要那个什么魔法师
<11-6,Joey>We don't need that wizard guy.

300
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,520
<11-6,Joey>我们去了几家具乐部  跟一些陌生人说过话
<11-6,Joey>We hit some clubs, talk to some strangers...

301
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,250
<11-6,Joey>等一下去码头  安排坐船的事
<11-6,Joey>...then go down to the docks and see about that boat thing.

302

<11-12,Gunther>-你们要喝咖啡吗  -对

<11-13,Joey>但我今天想早点睡  所以我要无咖啡因的
<11-13,Joey>I don't want to be up too late, so I'll have a decaf.

311
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,160
<11-15,Chandler>我刚才在那家店里都喊到哑了
<11-15,Chandler>I strained my voice screaming in there.

312
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,990
<11-15,Chandler>他们音乐非要开那么大声吗
<11-15,Chandler>Does it have to be so loud?

313
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,230
<11-16,Joey>我听不到你说什么  我耳鸣得厉害
<11-16,Joey>I can't hear what you said. My ears are ringing so bad.

314
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,940
<11-17,Ross>幸好我多带了一双袜子
<11-17,Ross>I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know?

315
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,500
<11-17,Ross>拿来当手套用
<11-17,Ross>I used them as mittens.

316
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,700
<11-17,Ross>最后那家店的任何东西  我都不敢用手碰
<11-17,Ross>I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.

317
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,580
<11-18,Ross>我们真是可悲到了极点
<11-18,Ross>How sad are we?

318
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,540
<11-19,Joey>对  我知道
<11-19,Joey>Yeah, I know.

319
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,510
<11-20,Chandler>其实我们并不可悲
<11-20,Chandler>You know what? We're not sad

320
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,740
<11-20,Chandler>只是我们都过了21岁
<11-20,Chandler>We're just not 21 anymore. You know?

<11-20,Chandler>只想舒服地坐着看电视
<11-20,Chandler>And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television

323
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,360
<11-20,Chandler>时间到了就上床睡觉
<11-20,Chandler>and go to bed at areasonable hour!

324
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,540
<11-22,Joey>我喜欢去安静一点的地方

328
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,240
<11-25,Joey>我们是29岁没错  但我们可不是娘儿们
<11-25,Joey>We're 29. We're not women

<12-3,Monica>我想了很多  很多很多
<12-3,Monica>I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.

333
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,430
<12-3,Monica>而且我想出了一堆
<12-3,Monica>And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses

334
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,630
<12-3,Monica>你能用上你货车的事业
<12-3,Monica>that you can do with your van. Okay?

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,680
<12-3,Monica>-你可以去送花  -什么
<12-3,Monica>- You could be a flower delivery person. - What?

336
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,390
<12-5,Monica>或是送面包
<12-5,Monica>Or a bakery delivery person?

340
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,080
<12-9,Monica>但我有预感你不想送货
<12-9,Monica>But I get the feeling you don't want to deliver.

341
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,520
<12-10,Phoebe>-对  -那好吧
<12-10,Phoebe>- No. - Okay.

342
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,750
<12-11,Monica>我猜若你不想送货的话
<12-11,Monica>I guess if you don't want to deliver

343
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,830
<12-11,Monica>八成也不会想去载货
<12-11,Monica>you probably don't want to pick up stuff either.

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,860
<12-12,Phoebe>对
<12-12,Phoebe>No.

<12-16,Phoebe>你还真是替我想了好多用那货车的办法呀
<12-16,Phoebe>You really wanted me to do something with this van.

352
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,300
<12-16,Phoebe>不如这样吧  我要你接下那主厨的工作
<12-16,Phoebe>You know what? I want you to take the chef job.

355
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,870
<12-18,Phoebe>我不想成为你不高兴的原因
<12-18,Phoebe>I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy.

356
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,210
<12-18,Phoebe>我最不想让自己不高兴了
<12-18,Phoebe>And I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.

357
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,150
<12-19,Monica>谢谢你
<12-19,Monica>Thank you.

358
