00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,860
<4-4,Rachel>你对他还是没兴趣

82
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,370
<4-16,Ross>我一整年没穿这套西装了
<4-16,Ross>because you hated it. Well, guess what?

<6-17,Phoebe>真令人兴奋啊
<6-17,Phoebe>That's exciting.

137
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,480
<6-17,Phoebe>你去了趟日本  编造了个女人
<6-17,Phoebe>You went to Japan, made up a woman.

138
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,290
<6-18,Pete>什么
<6-18,Pete>What?

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,190
<6-19,Phoebe>我是说这个女人...是虚构的  不是吗
<6-19,Phoebe>I'm just saying, this "woman," I mean, she's fictitious, no?

140
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,800
<6-20,Pete>-为什么这么说  -你还是喜欢莫妮卡
<6-20,Pete>- Why would you say that? - 'Cause you're still into Monica.

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,750
<6-21,Phoebe>你谎称有了别人  好让她与你共事
<6-21,Phoebe>You said there's somebody else so she would agree to work with you,

142
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,770
<6-21,Phoebe>因为你觉得  如果相处久了
<6-21,Phoebe>so 'cause you figure, if you spent a lot of time together,

143
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,540
<6-21,Phoebe>也许就会产生感情
<6-21,Phoebe>maybe something might happen, and...

144
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
<6-22,Pete>你真行  你真行
<6-22,Pete>You're good. You're good.

145
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,890
<6-23,Phoebe>我只是直觉准  还会通灵
<6-23,Phoebe>No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

146
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,550
<6-23,Phoebe>很实在的天赋
<6-23,Phoebe>It's a substantial gift.

147
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,170
<6-24,Pete>听我说  你能答应我不要告诉她吗
<6-24,Pete>Listen. Can you promise me that you won't tell her?

148
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,360
<6-25,Phoebe>没问题  我答应你  告诉她什么
<6-25,Phoebe>Absolutely. I promise. Tell her what?

00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,730
<6-26,Pete>谢谢你
<6-26,Pete>Thanks a lot.

150
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,930
<6-27,Phoebe>不  说真的
<6-27,Phoebe>No, I'm serious.

151
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,230
<6-27,Phoebe>虽然我的直觉很准  但记性很差
<6-27,Phoebe>I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,110
<7-1,Chandler>好吧  但这是最后一次
<7-1,Chandler>Okay, but this is the last time.

153
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,100
<7-1,Chandler>*这里有只小小鸡  那里有只小小鸡*
<7-1,Chandler>*With a chick-chick here And a chick-chick there*

154
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,070
<7-1,Chandler>*这只鸡  那只鸡  到处都有小小鸡*
<7-1,Chandler>*Here a chick, there a chick Everywhere a chick-chick*

157
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,680
<7-5,Chandler>妹妹
<7-5,Chandler>She?

158
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,240
<7-6,Joey>你不觉得是妹妹吗
<7-6,Joey>Don't you think it's a she?

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,520
<7-6,Joey>我不知道
<7-6,Joey>I don't know.

160
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,250
<7-7,Chandler>看不出来  那个东西一下子就缩回去了
<7-7,Chandler>I can't tell. Whatever it was went back in too quickly.

161
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,530
<7-7,Chandler>我要换衣服
<7-7,Chandler>Anyway, I gotta change.

162
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,710
<7-8,Joey>我要去跟其他演员喝酒
<7-8,Joey>I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

163
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,070
<7-9,Chandler>-什么  -怎么了

<7-11,Chandler>能有人陪着我们的小鸡
<7-11,Chandler>...so somebody could be here with our chick.

167
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,040
<7-12,Joey>是谁从凌晨两点撑到凌晨五点
<7-12,Joey>Who was up from 2:00 this morning until 5:00 this morning...

168
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,040
<7-12,Joey>就为了要哄她睡觉
<7-12,Joey>...trying to get her back to sleep?

169
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,770
<7-13,Chandler>你以为你起来时  我没醒着吗
<7-13,Chandler>You don't think I get up when you get up?

170
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,190
<7-14,Joey>又来了
<7-14,Joey>Oh, here it comes.

<7-15,Chandler>没错  又来了  我整天闷在家里
<7-15,Chandler>Yes! Here it comes! I'm stuck here all day!

172
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,450
<7-15,Chandler>你才回来跟我们呆了几秒钟
<7-15,Chandler>And then you come in and spend two seconds with us...

173
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,990
<7-15,Chandler>就要出去跟朋友花天酒地
<7-15,Chandler>...and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?

174
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,340
<7-15,Chandler>这样不行喔  先生
<7-15,Chandler>Well, I don't think so, mister!

175
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,700
<7-16,Joey>我需要轻松一下  好吗  我忙了一整天
<7-16,Joey>I need to relax, okay? I was working all day.

176
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,590
<7-17,Chandler>你觉得照顾我们的小鸡就不忙吗
<7-17,Chandler>And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?

177
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,180
<7-18,Joey>我不是那个意思  好吗
<7-18,Joey>That's not what I said, okay?

178
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,020
<7-18,Joey>-我是说...  -我知道你想说什么
<7-18,Joey>-  I just meant... - I know what you meant!

179
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,890
<7-19,Chandler>你有没有发现  自从有了小鸡
<7-19,Chandler>Did you notice that ever since we got this chick...

180
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,490
<7-19,Chandler>我们争吵的次数变多了
<7-19,Chandler>...we've been fighting a lot more than we used to?

181
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,620
<7-20,Joey>谁知道  也许我们还没准备好养小鸡
<7-20,Joey>I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.

182
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,620
<7-21,Chandler>我明天送她回去
<7-21,Chandler>I'll take her back tomorrow.

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,980
<7-25,Ross>怎么样  蓝色还是棕色的好
<7-25,Ross>What do you think? This blue suit or this brown one?

186
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,790
<7-26,Joey>棕色可以突显你的眼睛
<7-26,Joey>The brown one brings out your eyes.

187
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,310
<7-26,Joey>但蓝色那套  显得你的屁股很翘
<7-26,Joey>But your butt looks great in the blue one.

188
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,010
<7-27,Ross>真的吗

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,660
<8-12,Ross>别倔了  你的肋骨可能断了
<8-12,Ross>Come on, you probably have a broken rib.

<9-25,Rachel>跟妓女一样成熟吗
<9-25,Rachel>Sophisticated like a hooker?

<13-5,Chandler>我有送  但是店里不收
<13-5,Chandler>I did. But the store wouldn't take her back.

308
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,810
<13-5,Chandler>后来我带她去收容所  你猜我发现什么
<13-5,Chandler>Then I took her to the shelter. You know what I found out?

309
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,720
<13-6,Chandler>要是找不到人领养就要杀了她
<13-6,Chandler>If they can't find a home for her, they kill her!

310
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,550
<13-6,Chandler>我绝不让小雅丝敏惨遭毒手
<13-6,Chandler>I won't let that happen to little Jasmine.

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,720
<13-8,Chandler>所有的动物都一样
<13-8,Chandler>It's all kinds of other animals.

<14-1,Monica>我都可以住在里面
<14-1,Monica>I could live in this thing!

321
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,870
<14-1,Monica>虽然会冷  不过我本来就很冷
<14-1,Monica>I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

<14-9,Monica>你对我还是有感觉  是吧
<14-9,Monica>You still have feelings for me don't you?

331
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,760
<14-10,Pete>不  我只是对餐厅的事很兴奋
<14-10,Pete>No, I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.

332
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,870
<14-12,Pete>-彼特  -好吧  我爱你  有这么糟吗

335
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,770
<14-14,Pete>我们两个人中会受伤的人是我
<14-14,Pete>The only one who stands to get hurt is me,

336
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,400
<14-14,Pete>我都不介意了
<14-14,Pete>and I'm okay with that.

337
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,480
<14-15,Monica>你或许不介意受伤
<14-15,Monica>You may be okay with getting hurt...

338
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,560
<14-15,Monica>但我却不能当那个伤你的人
<14-15,Monica>but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you.

339
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,130
<14-15,Monica>-所以我不能接受这份工作  -什么
<14-15,Monica>- That's why I can't take this job. - What?

340
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,270
<14-17,Monica>我们或许也不该再见面了
<14-17,Monica>We probably shouldn't see each other anymore.

<15-2,Ross>瑞秋  X光片看起来怎么会胖
<15-2,Ross>Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.

348
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,170
<15-4,Chandler>你给我在这里好好反省
<15-4,Chandler>Now you stay out here and you think about what you did!

349
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,790
<15-5,Ross>-那是一只鸭子  -一只坏鸭子
<15-5,Ross>- That's a duck! - That's a bad duck!
