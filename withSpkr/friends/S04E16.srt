00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,090
<1-2,Phoebe>不是  我不知道想吃什么
<1-2,Phoebe>Nothing.I can't find anything to eat.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,730
<1-2,Phoebe>我吃什么都会恶心
<1-2,Phoebe>Everything makes me nauseous.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,970
<1-2,Phoebe>告诉你们  怀孕真不是件容易的事[蛋糕]
<1-2,Phoebe>I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake

<1-4,Phoebe>什么味道  是浴室里传出来的
<1-4,Phoebe>What is that smell?It's coming from the bathroom.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,430
<1-5,Chandler>怀孕倒是让你多了不少怪癖
<1-5,Chandler>Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,520
<1-5,Chandler>是我  菲比  这里有我想吃的东西
<1-5,Chandler>It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,160
<2-6,Phoebe>是  是  是

16
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,040
<2-6,Phoebe>真不敢相信
<2-6,Phoebe>I can't believe it!

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,620
<2-6,Phoebe>宝宝想吃红肠  我却不能吃肉
<2-6,Phoebe>The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!

18
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,680
<2-7,Joey>等一下
<2-7,Joey>Wait!

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,420
<2-7,Joey>也许是酸黄瓜

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,570
<3-1,Chandler>你在写什么
<3-1,Chandler>What are you writing?

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,350
<3-2,Rachel>约书亚明天回来
<3-2,Rachel>Joshua's coming in tomorrow,

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,930
<3-2,Rachel>既然我没胆量约他
<3-2,Rachel>and since I don't have the guts to ask him out. . .

39
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,230
<3-2,Rachel>那我就卖他一件外套
<3-2,Rachel>. . .I'm gonna sell him a coat

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,720
<3-2,Rachel>再把这纸条塞进衣服口袋
<3-2,Rachel>and put this note in the pocket.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,970
<3-3,Chandler>约书亚  有空打电话给我
<3-3,Chandler>'Joshua, give me a call sometime.

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,180
<3-3,Chandler>象你这样的人
<3-3,Chandler>Guys like you...

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,610
<3-3,Chandler>...永不过时
<3-3,Chandler>...never go out of style. '

44
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,740
<3-3,Chandler>你扔掉的纸上都写了什么
<3-3,Chandler>What did you throw away?

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,610
<3-6,Joey>-大伙都在啊  -你们干什么去了
<3-6,Joey>- Hi, guys. - What have you been up to?

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,740
<3-7,Ross>我们去参观了维多利亚时期门把手展
<3-7,Ross>We went to see a collection ofvictorian doorknobs at the museum.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
<3-8,Chandler>居然不带我去
<3-8,Chandler>Without me?

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
<3-9,Emily>是我叔叔硬拖我们去的
<3-9,Emily>My uncle dragged us there,

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,460
<3-9,Emily>不过其实展览还挺有意思的
<3-9,Emily>But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,870
<3-11,Emily>那些门把很华丽  不信你们看
<3-11,Emily>They were so ornate and beautiful. Look at that.

51
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,580
<3-12,Monica>我不知道英国博物馆是怎么个规矩
<3-12,Monica>I don't know how museums work in England,

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,330
<3-12,Monica>但在我们这里  顺手牵羊是不对的
<3-12,Monica>but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,960
<3-13,Emily>这是从礼品店搞来的
<3-13,Emily>I got it from the gift shop.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,460
<3-13,Emily>那里的安保太松懈了
<3-13,Emily>They have really lax security.

55
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,370
<3-13,Emily>开玩笑的
<3-13,Emily>It's a joke.

56
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,750
<3-15,Emily>-我得走了  再会  -再会
<3-15,Emily>- I've got to be off. See you. Bye bye then. - Bye bye then.

57
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,050
<3-16,Joey>看来你们处得不错
<3-16,Joey>You're having a good time.

58
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,930
<3-17,Ross>她很不错  也很有意思
<3-17,Ross>She is amazing, and she's so much fun.

59
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,380
<3-17,Ross>而且你们知道吗
<3-17,Ross>And you know what?

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,910
<3-17,Ross>和她在一起  我也很快乐
<3-17,Ross>When I'm with her, I'm fun!

61
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,810
<3-17,Ross>我甚至还报了直升机驾驶课
<3-17,Ross>I even signed up for helicopter classes.

62
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,510
<3-17,Ross>她过两天就走了  我不必真学
<3-17,Ross>She's leaving in two days. I don't have to do it.

63
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,320
<3-18,Monica>两天  你一定很失望吧
<3-18,Monica>In two days? You must be bummed.

64
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,500
<3-19,Ross>她非回去不可  不过我开始就有心理准备
<3-19,Ross>She's got to go back, but I've been prepared for this from the start.

65
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,110
<3-19,Ross>我们都知道只有两周能在一起  仅此而已
<3-19,Ross>We knew we had two weeks together and then that's it.

66
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,360
<3-20,Joey>我的每段恋情都这样
<3-20,Joey>That's what all my relationships are like.

67
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,130
<3-21,Chandler>但在罗斯的恋情中
<3-21,Chandler>But in Ross' case,

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,210
<3-21,Chandler>"双方"都知道只有二个星期
<3-21,Chandler>they both know two weeks, that's it.

69
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,380
<3-22,Ross>-菲比 -嘿  嘿
<3-22,Ross>- Pheebs! - Hello. Hello.

70
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,170
<3-24,Ross>我知道  我知道  好啦
<3-24,Ross>Yeah, I know. I know!

71
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,390
<3-25,Phoebe>宝宝想吃肉想疯了
<3-25,Phoebe>The baby is totally craving meat.

72
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,170
<3-25,Phoebe>我下午想用素肉堡骗他
<3-25,Phoebe>This afternoon, I made it a soy burger,

73
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,020
<3-25,Phoebe>让他以为自己吃到了肉
<3-25,Phoebe>so that it'd think it was getting meat.

74
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,450
<3-25,Phoebe>结果我就反胃了
<3-25,Phoebe>And I got nauseous.

75
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,850
<3-26,Chandler>也许是因为素肉堡巨难吃无比
<3-26,Chandler>Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!

76
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,000
<3-27,Phoebe>怀孕可把我的胃害惨了
<3-27,Phoebe>Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,130
<3-28,Joey>但你身上有一种孕妇的光彩
<3-28,Joey>But you got that cool pregnant-lady glow.

78
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,590
<3-29,Phoebe>那是汗  你要是吐一早上  也会有这样光彩的
<3-29,Phoebe>That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,940
<4-2,Rachel>-这是你要的风衣  -太棒了
<4-2,Rachel>- Here's that trench coat you wanted. - Great.

80
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,200
<4-3,Joshua>很舒服
<4-3,Joshua>It's comfortable.

81
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,320
<4-5,Joshua>这下我就可以出去当暴露狂了
<4-5,Joshua>You could really flash somebody in this.

82
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,870
<4-6,Rachel>不行  不行  出了店门
<4-6,Rachel>Don't put your hands in the pockets

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
<4-6,Rachel>才能把手放进口袋里
<4-6,Rachel>until you are out of the store.

84
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,320
<4-7,Joshua>为什么不行
<4-7,Joshua>Why not?

85
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,820
<4-8,Rachel>因为...
<4-8,Rachel>Well, because...

86
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,380
<4-8,Rachel>有很多人...
<4-8,Rachel>...we get a lot of--

87
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,080
<4-9,Joshua>他们真是害群之马
<4-9,Joshua>They ruin it for everybody.

88
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,230
<4-10,Rachel>没错
<4-10,Rachel>I know.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,260
<4-11,Joshua>我昨晚穿着那件羊毛衫去约了个会
<4-11,Joshua>Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.

90
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,500
<4-13,Joshua>我离婚后的第一次约会
<4-13,Joshua>It was the first date since the divorce.

91
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,480
<4-14,Rachel>恭喜  你爱她吗
<4-14,Rachel>Congratulations. So do you love her?

92
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,810
<4-15,Joshua>她还不错  不过这也让我发现
<4-15,Joshua>She's nice, but it made me realize...

93
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,000
<4-15,Joshua>我其实还没有心情约会
<4-15,Joshua>...I'm just not ready to be dating.

94
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,130
<4-16,Rachel>有点意思
<4-16,Rachel>That's interesting.

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,610
<4-17,Joshua>-那是什么  -防盗磁条
<4-17,Joshua>-What was that? -Just an anti-theft device.

96
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,130
<4-19,Joshua>那这是什么
<4-19,Joshua>And what's this?

97
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,650
<4-20,Rachel>这个和这个  你都需要的
<4-20,Rachel>You need that, you need that too

98
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,890
<4-20,Rachel>因为很明显  贼会把它给撕掉的
<4-20,Rachel>cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,290
<5-1,Rachel>今晚开派对
<5-1,Rachel>Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight!

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,220
<5-1,Rachel>事实上派对五分钟后就开始
<5-1,Rachel>Actually, we have to have one in five minutes,

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,260
<5-1,Rachel>有事的快取消
<5-1,Rachel>so everybody cancel your plans.

102
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,370
<5-2,Chandler>-什么情况  -怎么了
<5-2,Chandler>- What are you talking about? - What's going on?

103
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,630
<5-4,Rachel>我们要给艾蜜莉办"惊喜欢送会"
<5-4,Rachel>We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily.

104
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,370
<5-4,Rachel>但其实是为了约书亚
<5-4,Rachel>But it's actually for Joshua.

105
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,190
<5-4,Rachel>他说  他还没有心情约会
<5-4,Rachel>He said he's not ready to date.

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,140
<5-4,Rachel>所以  我不得不邀请他参加派对
<5-4,Rachel>So I had to invite him to a party

107
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,910
<5-4,Rachel>这样我才能在工作之外见到他
<5-4,Rachel>if I wanted to see him outside of work.

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,300
<5-4,Rachel>现在我制造了一个色诱他的完美机会
<5-4,Rachel>And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

109
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,140
<5-5,Ross>虽然我很想当面警告约书亚
<5-5,Ross>As much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him. . .

110
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,830
<5-5,Ross>但我和艾蜜莉不会参加派对
<5-5,Ross>Emily and I won't be here.

111
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,080
<5-5,Ross>她会先来和大家道别
<5-5,Ross>She'll come by to say goodbye.

112
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,560
<5-5,Ross>然后我已经安排了整晚的节日
<5-5,Ross>I've got a special evening planned.

113
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,400
<5-5,Ross>抱歉  没有派对了
<5-5,Ross>Sorry. No party.

115
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,230
<5-7,Emily>惊喜
<5-7,Emily>Surprise!

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,240
<5-8,Rachel>惊喜
<5-8,Rachel>Surprise!

117
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,540
<5-10,Emily>从没有人给我办过惊喜派对
<5-10,Emily>No one's thrown me a surprise party before.

118
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,810
<5-11,Rachel>其实  这都是罗斯的主意
<5-11,Rachel>Well, it was all Ross' idea.

119
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,780
<5-12,Emily>你真好
<5-12,Emily>You're so sweet.

120
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,160
<5-12,Emily>我好惊喜
<5-12,Emily>And I'm so surprised.

121
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,130
<5-13,Ross>你真的没料到
<5-13,Ross>You didn't know?

122
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,290
<6-1,Chandler>约书亚在那边  你怎么在这边
<6-1,Chandler>Why are you here if Joshua's all the way over there?

123
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,450
<6-2,Rachel>我想欲擒故纵
<6-2,Rachel>I'm trying to play hard-to-get.

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,530
<6-2,Rachel>快  他在看这边  快说句好笑的话
<6-2,Rachel>Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.

125
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,300
<6-3,Chandler>比如
<6-3,Chandler>Like what?

126
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,960
<6-4,Joey>什么事这么好笑
<6-4,Joey>What's so funny?

127
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,740
<6-3,Chandler>我说"比如"
<6-3,Chandler>"Like what?"

128
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,940
<6-6,Joey>真深奥
<6-6,Joey>Now that's a thinker.

129
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,680
<6-7,Rachel>欲擒故纵不起作用
<6-7,Rachel>This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.

130
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,470
<6-7,Rachel>把樱桃给我
<6-7,Rachel>Hand me those cherries.

131
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,890
<6-9,Rachel>-要吃樱桃吗  -不用了  谢谢
<6-9,Rachel>- Care for a cherry? - No, thanks.

132
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,400
<6-11,Rachel>我可以用舌头  给樱桃梗打个结
<6-11,Rachel>I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.

133
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,030
<6-12,Joshua>你还好吗
<6-12,Joshua>You okay?

134
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,910
<6-12,Joshua>你还好吗
<6-12,Joshua>All right?

135
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,760
<6-13,Ross>我们得赶快走了
<6-13,Ross>We should probably get going soon.

136
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,400
<6-14,Emily>但是派对才刚开始啊
<6-14,Emily>But the party's just getting started.

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,110
<9-1,Phoebe>我都不吃肉  那是冷血谋杀
<9-1,Phoebe>I'll never eat meat. It's cold-blooded murder.

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,720
<9-5,Phoebe>我要吃肉  宝宝要吃肉
<9-5,Phoebe>I need the meat! The baby needs the meat.

203
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,200
<9-6,Joey>要是与人拍拖  那你就得专一
<9-6,Joey>You know when you dating someone, you don't want to cheat

204
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,250
<9-6,Joey>除非第三者真的很火辣

205
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
<9-7,Phoebe>那当然

206
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,960
<9-8,Joey>吃肉也一样
<9-8,Joey>This is the same kind of deal.

207
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,720
<9-8,Joey>既然错了

<10-1,Joey>Feel better?

210
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,250
<10-2,Phoebe>好点了  但我付出的代价呢
<10-2,Phoebe>Yeah, but at what cost?

211
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,150
<10-2,Phoebe>三餐吃肉吃半年
<10-2,Phoebe>Six months, three meals a day?

212
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,890
<10-2,Phoebe>我会因此吃掉...几百万头牛
<10-2,Phoebe>I am going to eat like, you know, millions of cows.

213
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,800
<10-3,Joey>要是我帮你平衡过来呢
<10-3,Joey>What if I said I can even things out for you, meat-wise?

214
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,400
<10-5,Joey>-什么  -我很能吃肉对吧
<10-5,Joey>- What? - I eat a lot of meat, right?

215
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,030
<10-6,Phoebe>要是在宝宝出生前  我戒吃肉
<10-6,Phoebe>But suppose, until the baby's born, I laid off it.

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,930
<10-7,Joey>这样就不会多死动物了
<10-7,Joey>No extra animals would die.

217
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,570
<10-7,Joey>你只是在吃我那份
<10-7,Joey>You'd just be eating my animals.

218
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,580
<10-8,Phoebe>真不敢想信  你愿意为我这么做
<10-8,Phoebe>I can't believe you'd do that for me.

219
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,860
<10-9,Joey>当然愿意  我也可以吃素
<10-9,Joey>Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian.

220
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,460
<10-9,Joey>啤酒里没有肉吧
<10-9,Joey>There's no meat in beer, right?

221
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,340
<11-1,Ross>如果不吃开胃菜   马上买单
<11-1,Ross>We can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers

222
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,130
<11-1,Ross>兴许我们还赶得上吃主菜
<11-1,Ross>and ask for our check right away.

223
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,290
<11-2,Emily>我们现在不能走  瑞秋要表演了

<11-4,Rachel>我的幸运裙效果不佳
<11-4,Rachel>My lucky dress wasn't working too well for me.

227

<11-4,Rachel>但四年来  这套衣服百发百中

<12-1,Gunther>实在很不舒服
<12-1,Gunther>is really bothering me.

256
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,620
<13-1,Joshua>这里以前是我的卧室
<13-1,Joshua>This used to be my bedroom.

257
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,220
<13-2,Rachel>有很多回忆  很多很多的回亿
<13-2,Rachel>A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.

258
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,390
<13-2,Rachel>要是墙壁会说话  它们一定会说
<13-2,Rachel>If these walls could talk, they'd say:

259
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,810
<13-2,Rachel>想听听往事吗
<13-2,Rachel>"Want to hear some memories?"

260
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,690
<13-3,Joshua>要帮忙吗
<13-3,Joshua>Need a little hand there?

261
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,800
<13-4,Rachel>不用  没问题
<13-4,Rachel>I got this all under control.

262
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,660
<13-5,Joshua>可是看起来不像
<13-5,Joshua>You really don't seem like you do.

263
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,590
<13-6,Rachel>算了  真是的
<13-6,Rachel>God! Forget it!

264
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,380
<13-6,Rachel>事情不该是这样的
<13-6,Rachel>This is not how this was supposed to happen.

265
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,860
<13-7,Joshua>不然应该怎样
<13-7,Joshua>What was supposed to happen?

266
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,620
<13-8,Rachel>你能不能不要看我
<13-8,Rachel>Can you not look at me when I say this?

267
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,330
<13-8,Rachel>我原以为要是能把你叫来...
<13-8,Rachel>I thought that if I could get you here...

268
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,470
<13-8,Rachel>就能色诱你
<13-8,Rachel>I could seduce you.

269
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,710
<13-9,Joshua>我上班从不穿西装
<13-9,Joshua>I don't wear suits to work.

270
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,270
<13-9,Joshua>却跟你买了六套
<13-9,Joshua>And I bought six of them from you.

271
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,820
<13-10,Rachel>抱歉  我还以为你有需要
<13-10,Rachel>I'm sorry. I thought you needed them.

272
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,040
<13-11,Joshua>我的意思是我一直去找你
<13-11,Joshua>My point is, I kept coming back

273
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,320
<13-11,Joshua>是因为我想见你
<13-11,Joshua>because I wanted to see you.

274
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,200
<13-12,Rachel>为什么
<13-12,Rachel>Why?

275
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,780
<13-13,Joshua>因为我喜欢你
<13-13,Joshua>Because I like you.

276
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,850
<13-14,Rachel>你喜欢我
<13-14,Rachel>You like me?

277
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,600
<13-15,Joshua>是啊  你漂亮  聪明又成熟
<13-15,Joshua>I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.

278
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,400
<13-15,Joshua>当然今晚我是没看到啦
<13-15,Joshua>A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

279
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,710
<13-14,Rachel>但是你喜欢我
<13-14,Rachel>But you like me?

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,970
<13-16,Rachel>这段日子以来  我们竟然一直互相喜欢
<13-16,Rachel>I can't believe this. All this time, I liked you and you liked me!

281
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
<13-17,Joshua>不要说"但是"
<13-17,Joshua>No "but. "

282
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,050
<13-18,Rachel>"但是"都没好事  停在"我们互相喜欢"就好
<13-18,Rachel>"But" is never good. Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me. "

283
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,560
<13-20,Rachel>-然而  -那是个好听的"但是"
<13-20,Rachel>- However. - No, that's a fancy "but. "

284
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,850
<13-21,Joshua>我刚结束我的婚姻
<13-21,Joshua>My marriage, like, just ended.

285
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,530
<13-21,Joshua>我还没心情跟别人交住
<13-21,Joshua>And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.

286
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,420
<13-22,Rachel>但是...
<13-22,Rachel>But...

287
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,850
<13-23,Joshua>对不起  我需要一点时问
<13-23,Joshua>I'm sorry. I just need a little time.

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,220
<14-1,Rachel>你在这里  我还在找你呢
<14-1,Rachel>There you are. I was looking for you.

289
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,470
<14-1,Rachel>约书亚走了  你和艾蜜莉可以走了
<14-1,Rachel>Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.

290
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,900
<14-1,Rachel>无所谓了
<14-1,Rachel>It's okay.

291
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,440
<14-2,Ross>她还在里面享受这场假派对
<14-2,Ross>She's still in there enjoying her fake party.

292
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,890
<14-2,Ross>现在要做什么也来不及了
<14-2,Ross>It's too late to do any of the stuff I had planned.

293
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,640
<14-3,Rachel>罗斯  抱歉  我毁了你美好的夜晚
<14-3,Rachel>Ross. I'm sorry. I ruined your evening.

294
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,820
<14-5,Rachel>我出了个大丑
<14-5,Rachel>If it makes you feel any better,

295
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,870
<14-5,Rachel>这有没有让你高兴一点
<14-5,Rachel>I made a fool of myself.

296
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,570
<14-6,Ross>有一点点
<14-6,Ross>Helps a little.

297
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,210
<14-7,Rachel>能让悲惨的失败者坐下来吗
<14-7,Rachel>Is there room there for a pathetic loser?

298
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,730
<14-8,Ross>坐吧
<14-8,Ross>Have a seat.

299
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,140
<14-9,Rachel>对不起
<14-9,Rachel>I'm so sorry.

300
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,270
<14-9,Rachel>没关系
<14-9,Rachel>It's okay.

301
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,010
<14-10,Ross>反正只是一段两周的恋情
<14-10,Ross>It was just a two-week thing anyway.

302
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,890
<14-10,Ross>我只是不想就这样结束
<14-10,Ross>I just didn't want it to end this way.

303
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,930
<14-11,Rachel>或许是你不想结束
<14-11,Rachel>Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

304
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,400
<14-12,Ross>什么意思
<14-12,Ross>What do you mean?

305
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,070
<14-13,Rachel>你似乎真的很喜欢她
<14-13,Rachel>You seem to really like her.

306
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,260
<14-14,Ross>没错
<14-14,Ross>I really do.

307
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,930
<14-14,Ross>但我能怎么办  我们说好
<14-14,Ross>What am I going to do? We agreed

308
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,030
<14-14,Ross>只在一起待两周的
<14-14,Ross>it'd be a two-week thing.

309
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,500
<14-14,Ross>不对彼此承诺什么
<14-14,Ross>No commitment.

310
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,580
<14-15,Rachel>那个女孩整晚都跟你的朋友嚷嚷着
<14-15,Rachel>That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends. . .

311
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,500
<14-15,Rachel>说是要听你的故事
<14-15,Rachel>asking to hear stories about you. . .

312
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,940
<14-15,Rachel>还拿莫妮卡的相簿来看
<14-15,Rachel>Iooking through Monica's photo albums.

313
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,640
<14-15,Rachel>只想二周的话  鬼才会这么做呢
<14-15,Rachel>You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.

314
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,200
<14-16,Ross>是吗
<14-16,Ross>You think?

315
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,590
<14-17,Rachel>她还有14个小时才去机场
<14-17,Rachel>You've got 1 4 hours until she has to be at the airport.

316
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,180
<14-17,Rachel>而你却坐在走廊上
<14-17,Rachel>And you're sitting here in a hallway. . .

317
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,350
<14-17,Rachel>陪一个28岁嘴肿起来的啦啦队员
<14-17,Rachel>with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

<14-22,Ross>天哪  那不是白化小孩
<14-22,Ross>Oh, my God! Those weren't albino kids.
