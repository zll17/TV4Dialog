<1-1,Chandler>这么说你的第一次

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,400
<1-1,Chandler>是跟女人做的咯
<1-1,Chandler>with a woman?

00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,510
<1-2,Bonnie>我那年15岁
<1-2,Bonnie>All right, I was 15.

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,000
<1-2,Bonnie>跟死党露丝在一起
<1-2,Bonnie>It was my best friend, Ruth.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,320
<1-2,Bonnie>苹果酒太烈  我们醉了
<1-2,Bonnie>And we got drunk on that hard cider.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,630
<1-2,Bonnie>突然之间  我们就开始亲热了
<1-2,Bonnie>And then suddenly, I don't know, we were making out.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,780
<1-3,Chandler>再说一次

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,580
<1-3,Chandler>说真的

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,040
<1-3,Chandler>那个女人除了性爱就不会聊别的了吗
<1-3,Chandler>Is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,700
<2-1,Rachel>不会啊  她刚才在聊地理啊
<2-1,Rachel>Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,240
<2-2,Joey>乔伊  她是在列举她在哪些国家做过
<2-2,Joey>Joey. She was listing the countries she's done it in.

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,550
<2-3,Monica>大家都获益匪浅
<2-3,Monica>I think we all learned something.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,230
<2-4,Joey>各位  看我找到什么  过来看看
<2-4,Joey>Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,820
<2-7,Phoebe>-知道其中的含意吗  -你其实50岁了吗
<2-7,Phoebe>- Do you know what that means? - That you're actually 50?

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,460
<2-8,Joey>不不  那个菲比不是我
<2-8,Joey>No, no. That's not "me" Phoebe.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,730
<2-9,Phoebe>是她的朋友
<2-9,Phoebe>That's her pal, Phoebe.

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,500
<2-9,Phoebe>从高中毕业纪念册上看来  她们是超好友
<2-9,Phoebe>According to her high school yearbook, they were BFF.

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,610
<2-12,Phoebe>这个女人八成知道我父母所有的事情
<2-12,Phoebe>So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents,

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,710
<2-12,Phoebe>甚至可能知道我爸的下落
<2-12,Phoebe>and she might even know like where my Dad is.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,980
<2-12,Phoebe>我去找她的住址  她就住在海边
<2-12,Phoebe>So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,800
<2-12,Phoebe>不然我们这个周末可以去海边吧
<2-12,Phoebe>So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,070
<2-15,Ross>太可惜了
<2-15,Ross>That's too bad.

29
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,180
<2-16,Rachel>真是扫兴
<2-16,Rachel>Big fat bummer.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,170
<2-17,Phoebe>太棒了  那我们明天开车去蒙托克
<2-17,Phoebe>So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,820
<3-1,Monica>我再也交不到男朋友了
<3-1,Monica>I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,210
<3-2,Chandler>我会变成老姑婆
<3-2,Chandler>I'm gonna die an old maid.

50
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,560
<3-2,Chandler>你不会变成老姑婆
<3-2,Chandler>You're not gonna die an old maid.

51
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,660
<3-2,Chandler>可能会变成老处女厨娘
<3-2,Chandler>Maybe an old spinster cook.

52
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,800
<3-4,Chandler>-谢了  -话说  如果万不得已
<3-4,Chandler>- Thanks. - Besides, worse comes to worse...

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,660
<4-3,Monica>你是在开玩笑吧
<4-3,Monica>You made a joke, right?

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,800
<4-3,Monica>所以我笑了
<4-3,Monica>So I laughed.

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,900
<4-4,Chandler>笑得太厉害了吧
<4-4,Chandler>A little too hard.

59
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,110
<4-4,Chandler>怎么  我不是当男朋友的料吗
<4-4,Chandler>What? Am I not boyfriend material?

60
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,900
<4-5,Monica>对啊  你是钱德勒嘛

<4-6,Chandler>好吧  我们刚确认了我的名字  然后打我一拳
<4-6,Chandler>Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.

63
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,400
<4-6,Chandler>但假设一下  我们不是朋友
<4-6,Chandler>But theoretically, I mean say we weren't friends,

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,550
<4-6,Chandler>有人介绍我们约会  我来到你家门口
<4-6,Chandler>say it's a blind date. I show up at your door

65
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,780
<4-6,Chandler>然后说"嗨  很高兴认识你"
<4-6,Chandler>and I'm, like, "Hey,nice to meet you."

66
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,630
<4-7,Monica>我大概会害怕用假音说话的人
<4-7,Monica>I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.

67
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,440
<4-9,Monica>真好  你买了吃的
<4-9,Monica>Oh, good. You bought food.

<4-12,Phoebe>...and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.

72
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,460
<4-13,Ross>你撞到快递员那件事怎么说
<4-13,Ross>What about that bike messenger you hit?

73
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,030
<4-14,Phoebe>我又不是在说他的运势
<4-14,Phoebe>Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

162
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,190
<7-41,Phoebe>也许她想给他一点时间...
<7-41,Phoebe>Maybe she just wanted to give him time...

<11-10,Rachel>Really?

248
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,870
<11-11,Bonnie>因为有时我会考虑重新剃光头
<11-11,Bonnie>Beacuse I think about shaving it again sometimes.

<12-4,Phoebe>她说她突然有事得进城  她在躲我
<12-4,Phoebe>She claims she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me.

258
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,910
<12-4,Phoebe>她不想说出我爸的下落
<12-4,Phoebe>She doesn't want to tell me where my father is.

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,920
<12-8,Phoebe>她家里一定有我爸在哪里的线索
<12-8,Phoebe>so, there's gotta be something in her house that tellsme where my Father is.

264
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,300
<12-9,Ross>菲比  有人称这种行为是"擅闯民宅"
<12-9,Ross>Pheebs, some people call that "breaking and entering."

<12-10,Phoebe>-这里有人这么想吗  -绝对没有
<12-10,Phoebe>- Well, are any of those people here? - Oh no.

<13-3,Ross>她碰巧提到剃头这件事的幕后主使
<13-3,Ross>She happened to bring up who was behind the whole head-shaving idea.

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,050
<13-3,Ross>是谁呢  对  没错  就是你
<13-3,Ross>And now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!

277
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,190
<13-4,Rachel>是她自己想剃
<13-4,Rachel>That was her idea.

278
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,030
<13-4,Rachel>我只是给了她点动力
<13-4,Rachel>I just gave her a nudge.

279
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,980
<13-5,Ross>她说你拿剃刀给她
<13-5,Ross>She said you gave her the razor.

<13-12,Rachel>拜托  看起来没那么糟嘛
<13-12,Rachel>Come on, see? She doesn't look that bad.

<13-13,Ross>你都能看到她的头反射月光
<13-13,Ross>You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!

285
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,520

<13-17,Ross>是你要分手的  还记得吗
<13-17,Ross>Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?

291
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,990
<13-18,Rachel>因为我很气你  不是因为我不爱你了
<13-18,Rachel>Because I was mad at you! Not because I stopped loving you!

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,870
<15-2,Ross>瑞秋还在气那件事

355
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,230
<15-14,Ross>头发会长回来  好不好  而且她很风趣很酷
<15-14,Ross>It'll grow back, right? And she's really fun,and she's cool.

356
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,550
<15-14,Ross>我终于往前走了
