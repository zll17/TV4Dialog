<8-6,Chandler>This way, I can split them up with a movie.

215
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:44,250
<8-7,Ross>现在只差格林牌扑克机欠了15块没给了
<8-7,Ross>So that just leaves the big Greene poker machine, who owes 15.

216

<8-8,Rachel>男生都这副德行
<8-8,Rachel>It's so typical.

<8-8,Rachel>"我得靠赢钱才能征服女人"
<8-8,Rachel>"I have to win money to exert my power over women!"

<8-9,Monica>你们跪地求饶  我们仰天大笑
<8-9,Monica>And you'll beg, and we'll laugh.

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,600
<8-9,Monica>我们会赢走你们的每一分钱
<8-9,Monica>And we'll take every last dime you have.

224
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,350
<8-9,Monica>你们会永远恨死自己
<8-9,Monica>And you'll hate yourselves forever!

225
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,470
<8-10,Rachel>你这有点给我拆台啊  莫妮卡
<8-10,Rachel>Kind of stepped on my point there, Mon.

227
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,800
<9-1,Ross>这样我们就不必浪费时间
<9-1,Ross>That way, we don't have to go through

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,780
<9-1,Ross>装模作样地玩一场了
