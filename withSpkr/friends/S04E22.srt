35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,190
<2-8,Chandler>哦  尴尬了  尴尬了  尴尬了

<2-12,Joey>永远都没机会当伴郎了
<2-12,Joey>I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

<2-13,Chandler>我结婚时  你可以当我的伴郎
<2-13,Chandler>You can be the best man when I get married.

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,910
<2-16,Chandler>不是啊  当然  你可以当我的伴郎

<2-18,Chandler>I'm not even getting married!

49
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,850

<2-19,Joey>真不敢相信你居然不找我

<9-1,Joey>跳脱衣舞的
<9-1,Joey>Stripper!

187
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,520
<9-1,Joey>舞娘把戒指偷走了
<9-1,Joey>The stripper stole the ring!

188
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,820
<10-1,Joey>钱德勒  起床  脱衣舞娘把戒指偷走了
<10-1,Joey>Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!

<10-2,Chandler>- What? - The ring is gone!

190
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,560
<10-3,Joey>先让我清醒一下
<10-3,Joey>Just give me a minute to wake up for this.

191
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,810
<10-4,Chandler>你把戒指弄丢了  你是史上最逊的伴郎
<10-4,Chandler>You lost the ring. You're the worst best man, ever!

192
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,020
<10-5,Joey>伙计  一点都不好笑
<10-5,Joey>Dude, this isn't funny.

193
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,290
<10-5,Joey>我该怎么办
<10-5,Joey>What am I gonna do?

194
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,260
<10-5,Joey>我昨晚去睡觉的时候还一切正常
<10-5,Joey>I go to sleep last night, everything's cool.

195
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,180
<10-5,Joey>等我醒来  舞娘走了  戒指也不见了
<10-5,Joey>I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!

196
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,510
<10-6,Chandler>-你跟她上床了  -废话
<10-6,Chandler>- You slept with the stripper? - Of course!

197
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,260
<11-2,Rachel>-嘿  你们好  -嘿  菲比  -嘿  菲比
<11-2,Rachel>- Hi, guys. - Hi, Phoebe. - Hi, Phoebs

198
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,700
<11-4,Phoebe>我想说声抱歉
<11-4,Phoebe>I wanted to apologize if I

199
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,550
<11-4,Phoebe>我昨天在送礼会上似乎凶了点
<11-4,Phoebe>seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.

200
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,120
<11-4,Phoebe>激素作祟
<11-4,Phoebe>Just the hormones.

201
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,160
<11-5,Rachel>-没事  我们  -激素嘛
<11-5,Rachel>- No, we... - Hormones.

202
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,620
<11-6,Monica>不管怎么样  我都要谢谢你们  你们真有心
<11-6,Monica>Anyway, I wanted to say thank you. It was so sweet.

203
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,550
<11-8,Phoebe>你似乎好多了  太好了
<11-8,Phoebe>You seem to be doing much better. That's great.

204
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,200
<11-9,Monica>-你现在怎样  -很好
<11-9,Monica>- How are things going? - Good.

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,900
<11-10,Phoebe>感觉最近的注意力都在我身上
<11-10,Phoebe>It feels like everything's been about me lately.

206
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,590
<11-10,Phoebe>你们最近都怎么样了
<11-10,Phoebe>So what's happening with you?

207
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,990
<11-11,Rachel>我们正在说
<11-11,Rachel>Well, actually, we were just talking about

208
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,330
<11-11,Rachel>我不去参加罗斯的婚礼
<11-11,Rachel>me not going to Ross' wedding.

209
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,950
<11-13,Rachel>有那段过住  我可能很难面对
<11-13,Rachel>It just might be too hard, given the history and all that.

210
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,970
<11-14,Phoebe>这让我想起当年流落街头时
<11-14,Phoebe>This reminds me of the time when I was living on the street.

211
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,120
<11-14,Phoebe>有人说我陪他上床就请我吃饭
<11-14,Phoebe>This guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.

212
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,720
<11-15,Rachel>这两件事哪里像
<11-15,Rachel>How is this like that?

213
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,380
<11-16,Phoebe>我想想  的确不像
<11-16,Phoebe>Well, let's see. It's not really like that.

214
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,520
<11-16,Phoebe>因为那才算是问题
<11-16,Phoebe>Because, you see, that was an actual problem.

215
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,620
<11-16,Phoebe>你这只是高中女生无病呻吟
<11-16,Phoebe>And yours is just a bunch of high-school crap

216
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,930
<11-16,Phoebe>没人在乎
<11-16,Phoebe>that nobody really gives...

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,530
<11-17,Rachel>抱歉  我只是觉得...
<11-17,Rachel>I'm sorry. I guess I just thought...

218
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,290
<11-18,Phoebe>眼泪攻势来了
<11-18,Phoebe>Here come the water works.

219
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,430
<11-18,Phoebe>我已经没辙了
<11-18,Phoebe>I don't know what I'm gonna do.

220
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,900
<11-18,Phoebe>我打给中介公司  他们说不管
<11-18,Phoebe>I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.

221
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,420
<12-1,Joey>我打911又被吼
<12-1,Joey>I called 911 and they yelled at me.

222
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,340
<12-1,Joey>如果这都不算紧急事件  那什么才算
<12-1,Joey>If this isn't an emergency, then what is!

223
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,280
<12-4,Joey>我来了
<12-4,Joey>Hey, guys.

224
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,620
<12-5,Ross>我想为昨晚的派对再次谢谢你
<12-5,Ross>I just want to thank you again for last night.

225
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,000
<12-5,Ross>真的好难忘
<12-5,Ross>What a great party.

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
<12-5,Ross>博物馆那伙人玩得很爽
<12-5,Ross>The guys from work had a blast.

227
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,820
<12-5,Ross>其中有个没参加过单身派对
<12-5,Ross>You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.

228
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,870
<12-5,Ross>还有个没参加过派对
<12-5,Ross>Another one had never been to a party before.

229
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,090
<12-6,Joey>那个结婚戒指
<12-6,Joey>So, hey, that wedding ring.

230
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,310
<12-7,Ross>-伙计  可真漂亮啊  -可不是嘛
<12-7,Ross>- Man, that is nice. - Yeah, right?

231
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,710
<12-8,Joey>我打算给自己也买一个一样的
<12-8,Joey>I was thinking about picking one of those babies up for myself.

232
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,860
<12-8,Joey>要去哪里买
<12-8,Joey>Where might one get one of those?

233
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,230
<12-9,Ross>那个戒指啊
<12-9,Ross>That ring?

234
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,320
<12-9,Ross>我奶奶刚来到这个国家时
<12-9,Ross>When my grandmother first came to this country,

235
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,290
<12-9,Ross>那枚戒指和她背包里的衣服
<12-9,Ross>that ring and the clothes on her back

236
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,780
<12-9,Ross>就是她的全部家当了
<12-9,Ross>were all she had with her.

237
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,380
<12-10,Chandler>也就是说那枚戒指是独一无二的咯
<12-10,Chandler>So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.

238
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,030
<12-11,Ross>当然  它是我家的传家宝
<12-11,Ross>Absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.

239
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,300
<12-11,Ross>每个戴上它的新娘都能幸福到老
<12-11,Ross>And every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.

240
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,590
<12-12,Chandler>也就是说它是一枚魔戒咯
<12-12,Chandler>So you might say it's a magic ring.

241
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,850
<12-13,Joey>是啊  可惜被脱衣舞娘偷了
<12-13,Joey>Yeah, the stripper stole it.

242
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,190
<12-14,Ross>我  我的戒指  我的结婚戒指
<12-14,Ross>My-my ring? My-my wedding ring?

243
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,240
<12-14,Ross>脱衣舞娘偷走了我的结婚戒指吗
<12-14,Ross>The stripper stole my wedding ring?

244
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,670
<12-14,Ross>怎么偷的  怎么会这样
<12-14,Ross>How? How could this happen?

245
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,310
<12-15,Chandler>我觉得原因就在于你说了
<12-15,Chandler>I think it all started when you said,

246
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,360
<12-15,Chandler>"嘿  乔伊  你来当我的伴郎吧"
<12-15,Chandler>"Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man!"

247
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,560
<12-16,Ross>好  没事  我来报警
<12-16,Ross>All right. All right. Fine. I'm going to call the cops.

248
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,650
<12-17,Joey>老兄  我是犯了大错
<12-17,Joey>Dude, I screwed up.

249
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,660
<12-17,Joey>可你也不用报警抓我吧
<12-17,Joey>But you don't have to turn me in.

250
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,980
<12-18,Ross>不是抓你  是抓那个舞娘
<12-18,Ross>Not on you, on the stripper.

251
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,930
<12-19,Joey>这样啊  我试过了
<12-19,Joey>Oh, yeah, I already did that.

252
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,360
<12-19,Joey>他们说等侦破所有谋杀案再说
<12-19,Joey>They said they'd look into it after they solve all the murders.

253
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,030
<12-20,Ross>那就找派她过来的中介公司
<12-20,Ross>Okay, then we'll call the company that sent her.

254
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,970
<12-21,Joey>我也试过了
<12-21,Joey>I did that too.

255
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,100
<12-21,Joey>他们不肯透露她的真名和电话
<12-21,Joey>They wouldn't give me her real name or her number.

256
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,440
<12-21,Joey>他们说我再打去就要报警
<12-21,Joey>They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.

257
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,730
<12-21,Joey>我说  "你去呀  就说我掉了枚戒指"
<12-21,Joey>I said, You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring.

258
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,060
<12-22,Ross>那怎么办  乔伊  你想让我怎么办
<12-22,Ross>So, what, Joey? What are you telling me?

259
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,370
<12-22,Ross>我们已经无计可施了吗
<12-22,Ross>That there's nothing we can do?

260
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,850
<12-23,Joey>-怎么会这样  -罗斯  我真的很抱歉
<12-23,Joey>- How could this happen? - Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.

261
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,640
<12-24,Chandler>我们可以再叫她一次
<12-24,Chandler>What if we just called her

262
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,260
<12-24,Chandler>用假名让她找去我的办公室
<12-24,Chandler>used a fake name and had her come to my office?

263
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,910
<12-25,Joey>这主意不错  但我们得先找戒指
<12-25,Joey>That sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!

264
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,650
<13-1,Monica>你的茶  菲比
<13-1,Monica>Here's your tea, Phoebe.

265
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680
<13-2,Phoebe>真好喝
<13-2,Phoebe>It's so good.

266
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,600
<13-3,Rachel>谢谢
<13-3,Rachel>Thanks.

267
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,050
<13-4,Monica>-那就好  -你喜欢就好
<13-4,Monica>- Good. - So glad you like it.

268
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,780
<13-7,Rachel>怎么了  怎么了  茶是她沏的
<13-7,Rachel>What? What? She made the tea.

269
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,000
<13-8,Phoebe>不是  我刚才宫缩了
<13-8,Phoebe>No, I think I just had a contraction.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,320
<13-10,Monica>-你怎么了  -天哪
<13-10,Monica>- You what? - Oh, my God!

271
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,640
<13-11,Phoebe>几分钟前我以为自己感觉到了一次
<13-11,Phoebe>I thougt I felt one a few minutes ago.

272
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,840
<13-11,Phoebe>现在才确定之前不是错觉
<13-11,Phoebe>And now I know that definitely was one.

273
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,940
<13-12,Monica>你不能在这里生
<13-12,Monica>You can't have the baby here.

274
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,150
<13-12,Monica>男生搬走之后我还没消毒
<13-12,Monica>I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!

275
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,110
<13-13,Rachel>没事  我们能搞定
<13-13,Rachel>Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

276
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,510
<13-13,Rachel>我来烧水  撕一点床单
<13-13,Rachel>I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets.

277
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,090
<13-14,Phoebe>别紧张  可能是假性宫缩
<13-14,Phoebe>It's all right. It's probably false labor.

278
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,820
<13-14,Phoebe>接近预产期会这样
<13-14,Phoebe>They said that can happen near the end.

279
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,560
<13-15,Monica>谁去拿书过来
<13-15,Monica>So just...somebody get the book.

280

<13-15,Monica>-瑞秋  拿书来  -书  好
<13-15,Monica>- Rachel, get the book! - The book! Okay! Okay!

<14-1,Joey>钱德勒  你站到桌子后面
<14-1,Joey>Chandler, you get behind the desk.

284
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,690
<14-1,Joey>但愿她进来没认出你...
<14-1,Joey>When she comes in, hopefully she won't recognize you because...

285
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,050
<14-1,Joey>她怎么会认得你
<14-1,Joey>Well, why would she?

286
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,890
<14-1,Joey>然后你按铃把罗斯和我叫来
<14-1,Joey>And then you buzz Ross and I.

<14-9,Joey>床头柜的丝绒盒里有只戒指
<14-9,Joey>There was a ring in a box on my night stand.

299
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,100
<14-9,Joey>你一走它就不见了
<14-9,Joey>After you left, it was gone.

300
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,680
<14-10,The Stripper>-你们觉得我偷了枚戒指  -对啊
<14-10,The Stripper>- You mean you guys think I stole some ring? - Yeah.

301

<14-12,Ross>一定是你偷的  少废话  从实招来
<14-12,Ross>We know you took it! Just save yourself the time and confess.

<14-13,The Stripper>我用不着偷那个劳什子好吗
<14-13,The Stripper>I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right?

305
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,920
<14-13,The Stripper>我干这份工作一星期能挣1600块
<14-13,The Stripper>I make $1,600 a week doing what I do.

306
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
<14-13,The Stripper>你们有人赚那么多吗
<14-13,The Stripper>Any of you guys make that?

307
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,000
<14-14,Chandler>嫁给我吧
<14-14,Chandler>Marry me.

308
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,660
<15-1,Joey>我不懂  戒指整晚都在我房里
<15-1,Joey>I don't get it. It was in my room all night.

309
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,100
<15-1,Joey>如果她没拿
<15-1,Joey>If she didn't take it,

310
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,360
<15-1,Joey>我没拿  你没拿  那是谁拿的
<15-1,Joey>I didn't take it, you didn't take it, then who did?

311
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,070
<15-1,Joey>我们在想事儿呢
<15-1,Joey>We're trying to think.

312
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,520
<16-1,Rachel>我还是没搞明白怎么区分真假宫缩
<16-1,Rachel>I still don't get how you know one's false labor.

313
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,300
<16-2,Phoebe>你有看到孩子掉出来了吗
<16-2,Phoebe>Do you see any babies?

314
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,530
<16-3,Monica>-你感觉如何  -还好吧
<16-3,Monica>- How do you feel? - Okay, I guess.

315
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,100
<16-3,Monica>我不知道
<16-3,Monica>I don't know.

316
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,980
<16-4,Phoebe>大概是因为快要结束了  我有点...
<16-4,Phoebe>I guess I know it's going to be over soon so...

317
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,510
<16-4,Phoebe>那不是很好吗
<16-4,Phoebe>But isn't that a good thing?

318
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,980
<16-5,Rachel>-你说你受够了  -我知道
<16-5,Rachel>- You said you were sick of this. - I know.

319
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,590
<16-6,Phoebe>通常怀孕完之后
<16-6,Phoebe>You kno, usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing,

320
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,560
<16-6,Phoebe>就该当妈妈了
<16-6,Phoebe>and you get to do the mom thing.

321
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,020
<16-6,Phoebe>而我却会...
<16-6,Phoebe>But I'm gonna be...

322
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,720
<16-6,Phoebe>穿着皮裤喝龙舌兰
<16-6,Phoebe>sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.

323
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,910
<16-7,Monica>有些妈妈也会那样
<16-7,Monica>Some moms do that.

324
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,080
<16-7,Monica>那样更可悲了
<16-7,Monica>That's even sadder.

325
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,320
<16-8,Phoebe>我知道自己该做什么
<16-8,Phoebe>Look, I know what I got myself into.

326
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,880
<16-8,Phoebe>但他们现在在我肚子里
<16-8,Phoebe>It's just that now that they're in me,

327
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,240
<16-8,Phoebe>我似乎很了解他们...
<16-8,Phoebe>it's like I know them and...

328
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,630
<16-8,Phoebe>把他们送走时我会很难受
<16-8,Phoebe>It just won't be easy when these little babies have to go away.

329
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,050
<16-8,Phoebe>亲爱的  我知道
<16-8,Phoebe>I know, sweetie.

330
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,000
<16-9,Monica>但这不代表你会一无所有啊
<16-9,Monica>But it's not like you won't have anything.

331
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,310
<16-9,Monica>你会有侄子侄女
<16-9,Monica>You'll have nieces and nephews.

332
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,830
<16-9,Monica>这样其实更好
<16-9,Monica>In some ways, that's even better.

333
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,540
<16-10,Phoebe>-少来了  -不  是真的
<16-10,Phoebe>- Yeah, okay. - No, really.

334
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,950
<16-11,Rachel>你不必为他们的大学学费缩衣节食
<16-11,Rachel>You are not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college.

335
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,630
<16-11,Rachel>或在他们不乖时骂他们
<16-11,Rachel>Or yelling at them when they're bad.

336
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,460
<16-11,Rachel>或在他们吵个不停时喂他们吃药
<16-11,Rachel>Or putting them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down.

337
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,250
<16-12,Monica>他们离家出走时
<16-12,Monica>You're gonna be the one they come to

338
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,790
<16-12,Monica>会来找你
<16-12,Monica>when they were running away from home.

339
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,950
<16-12,Monica>他们会跟你讨论性的问题
<16-12,Monica>The one they talk to about sex.

340
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,280
<16-13,Rachel>你可以当酷姑姑菲比
<16-13,Rachel>You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

<16-16,Rachel>And you know what else?

344
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,590
<16-16,Rachel>他们一定会爱死你的
<16-16,Rachel>Oh, my God. Are they going to love you!

349
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,930
<16-22,Monica and Rachel>怎么了

350
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,260
<16-23,Phoebe>开玩笑的

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,790
<17-1,Joey>要是他出了什么事
<17-1,Joey>If anything should happen to him...

354
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,680
<17-2,Ross>乔伊  兽医说手术很简单
<17-2,Ross>Joey, the vet said it's a simple procedure.

355
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,440
<17-3,Joey>那又如何  搞不好会出错
<17-3,Joey>So? Things could go wrong.

356
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,870
<17-3,Joey>你又不知道  要是它没撑过去呢
<17-3,Joey>You don't know. What if he doesn't make it?

357
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,900
<17-4,Chandler>-他会的  乔  -可万一没有呢
<17-4,Chandler>- He will, Joe. - But what if he doesn't?

358
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,260
<17-5,Joey>他真是只好鸭子
<17-5,Joey>He's such a good duck.

359
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,050
<17-6,Joey>我好担心他
<17-6,Joey>I'm so worried about him!

360

<17-7,The Doctor>有人丢了戒指吗
<17-7,The Doctor>Somebody lose a ring?
