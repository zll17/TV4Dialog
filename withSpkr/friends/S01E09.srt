124
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,560
<4-1,Ross>如果她和宝宝说话
<4-1,Ross>Look, if she's talking to it,

125
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,960
<4-1,Ross>那我也应该有一些"肚子谈话时间"
<4-1,Ross>I just think that I should get some belly time too.

126
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,790
<4-1,Ross>但这不表示我相信这个
<4-1,Ross>Not that I believe any of this.

127
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,240
<4-2,Phoebe>我相信  我觉得胎儿什么都能听见

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
<4-2,Phoebe>我可以证明给你看
<4-2,Phoebe>I can show you.

129
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,610
<4-2,Phoebe>可能会有点怪异
<4-2,Phoebe>Look, this will seem a little weird,

130
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,360
<4-2,Phoebe>你把头放在这只火鸡里面
<4-2,Phoebe>but you put your head inside this turkey,

131
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,930
<4-2,Phoebe>然后大伙儿说话  你肯定都能听到
<4-2,Phoebe>and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.

132
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,500
<4-3,Chandler>我要说  我绝对赞成这个实验

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,720
<9-2,Ross>好的  好的  开始
<9-2,Ross>Ok, ok, here we go.

252
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,230
<9-2,Ross>这里吗  我得对着哪里说啊
<9-2,Ross>Ok, where am I talking to, here?

253
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,960
<9-2,Ross>我的意思是
<9-2,Ross>I mean, uh, well,

254
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,110
<9-2,Ross>似乎只有一个通道
<9-2,Ross>there is one way that seems to

255
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,080
<9-2,Ross>可以传递声波
<9-2,Ross>offer a certain acoustical advantage, but

256
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,390
<9-3,Carol>只要对准正前方就可以了
<9-3,Carol>Just aim for the bump.

257
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,900
<9-4,Ross>好的  开始了
<9-4,Ross>Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.

258
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,920
<9-4,Ross>你知道  我  你知道  我做不到
<9-4,Ross>You know, I, you know, can't do this.

259
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,090
<9-4,Ross>这太奇怪了  我感到自己象个傻瓜
<9-4,Ross>Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.

260
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,150
<9-5,Carol>那就别做了  没关系的
<9-5,Carol>So don't do it, it's fine.

261
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,690
<9-5,Carol>你不必因为苏珊做了你就非得做
<9-5,Carol>You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.

262
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,940
<9-6,Ross>你好吗  宝宝  你好  你好
<9-6,Ross>Hello, baby. Hello, hello.

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,340
<10-1,Rachel>刚看到这只大狗的影子覆盖公园
<10-1,Rachel>I loved the moment when you first saw

264
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,030
<10-1,Rachel>感觉真好玩
<10-1,Rachel>the giant dog shadow all over the park.

265
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,770
<10-2,Phoebe>是的  但是他们必须把他射下来吗
<10-2,Phoebe>Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down?

266
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,620
<10-2,Phoebe>这简直太残忍了
<10-2,Phoebe>I mean, that was just mean.

267
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,950
<10-3,Monica>现在火鸡的外皮应该已经很脆了
<10-3,Monica>Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside,

268
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,060
<10-3,Monica>里面也应该很多汁了
<10-3,Monica>juicy on the inside.

269
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,600
<10-3,Monica>咱们还站在外面干嘛
<10-3,Monica>Why are we standing here?

270
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,250
<10-4,Rachel>等你开门  你拿着钥匙呢
<10-4,Rachel>We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.

271
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,010
<10-5,Monica>我没拿啊
<10-5,Monica>No I don't.

272
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,660
<10-6,Rachel>你拿了  出来的时候  你说拿了钥匙
<10-6,Rachel>Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."

273
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,920
<10-7,Monica>我没有  我说  "拿上钥匙"
<10-7,Monica>No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"

274
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,190
<10-8,Rachel>不不不  你是说"拿了钥匙"
<10-8,Rachel>No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".

275
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,270
<10-9,Chandler>那么你俩都没有拿钥匙了
<10-9,Chandler>Do either of you have the keys?

276
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,900
<10-10,Monica>烤箱还开着呢
<10-10,Monica>The oven is on.

277
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,360
<10-11,Rachel>哦  我得拿我的票
<10-11,Rachel>Oh, I gotta get my ticket!

278
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,310
<10-12,Joey>等等  我们有一把你家的备用钥匙
<10-12,Joey>Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.

279
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,090
<10-13,Monica>快去拿  快去
<10-13,Monica>Well then get it, get it!

280
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,530
<10-14,Joey>你这种语气无法加快我的速度
<10-14,Joey>That tone will not make me go any faster.

281
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,640
<10-14,Joey>-乔伊  -这个就可以了
<10-14,Joey>- Joey! - That one will.

282
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,210
<11-1,Ross>每个人都对我说  你得选个专业
<11-1,Ross>And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major,

283
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,190
<11-1,Ross>你得选个专业
<11-1,Ross>you gotta pick a major.

284
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,050
<11-1,Ross>于是我鼓起勇气挑了古生物学
<11-1,Ross>So, on a dare, I picked paleontology.

285
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,070
<11-1,Ross>可能你不懂我正说什么
<11-1,Ross>And you have no idea what I'm saying,

286
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,780
<11-1,Ross>我们得面对现实  你还是一个胎儿
<11-1,Ross>because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

287
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,330
<11-1,Ross>你应该正为你的鳃消失了而兴高采烈
<11-1,Ross>You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.

288
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,340
<11-2,Carol>你不用老是说话
<11-2,Carol>Look, you don't have to talk to it.

289
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,630
<11-2,Carol>你也可以对它唱歌
<11-2,Carol>You can sing to it if you want.

290
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,360
<11-3,Ross>拜托  我才不想对着你的肚子唱歌呢
<11-3,Ross>Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?

291
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,030
<11-4,Susan>进展如何
<11-4,Susan>Hi, how's it goin?

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,980
<11-7,Ross>他一直都这样吗
<11-7,Ross>Does it always, uh--?

298
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,480
<11-8,Carol>不  没有  这是第一次
<11-8,Carol>No, no that was the first.

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,640
<11-9,Susan>接着唱  接着唱
<11-9,Susan>Keep singing! Keep singing!

<11-10,Ross>*When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, *

<11-10,Ross>*然后带你去动物园*
<11-10,Ross>*and then we'll go to the zoo.*

304
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,420
<11-11,Susan>-又来了一次  -这次我也感觉到了
<11-11,Susan>- It did it again! - I felt it that time!

305

<11-12,Ross>*嘿嘿  我是你的爸爸*
<11-12,Ross>*Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. *

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,670
<11-12,Ross>*没有乳房的那个*
<11-12,Ross>*I'm the one without any breasts.*

307
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,030
<12-2,Monica>你能快一点吗
<12-2,Monica>Can you go any faster with that?

308
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,750
<12-3,Joey>锁眼只有一个  而钥匙有上千把
<12-3,Joey>Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.

309
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,370
<12-3,Joey>你自己算算
<12-3,Joey>You do the math.

310
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,630
<12-4,Monica>你怎么会有那么多钥匙
<12-4,Monica>Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?

311
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,240
<12-5,Chandler>以备不时之需  就象现在这样
<12-5,Chandler>For an emergency just like this.

312
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,180
<12-6,Rachel>你听着  傻笑的这位
<12-6,Rachel>All right, listen, smirky.

313
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,680
<12-6,Rachel>要不是你和你那该死的气球
<12-6,Rachel>If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon,

314
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,030
<12-6,Rachel>我现在已经在飞机上看空姐演示动作了
<12-6,Rachel>I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now.

315
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,650
<12-6,Rachel>可现在没戏了
<12-6,Rachel>But I'm not.

316
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,420
<12-7,Monica>我发誓当时你说你拿钥匙了
<12-7,Monica>I swear you said you had the keys.

317
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,430
<12-7,Monica>不  没有
<12-7,Monica>No, I didn't.

318
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,310
<12-8,Rachel>如果我没有拿钥匙就不会说拿了
<12-8,Rachel>I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys,

319
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,030
<12-8,Rachel>显然我没拿那该死的钥匙
<12-8,Rachel>and I obviously didn't have the keys.

320
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,700
<12-9,Phoebe>好啦  够了  谁都不准再说钥匙
<12-9,Phoebe>Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.

321
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,580
<12-10,Monica>为什么非得我拿钥匙
<12-10,Monica>Why would I have the keys?

322
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,480
<12-11,Rachel>因为正是你说了拿钥匙了
<12-11,Rachel>Aside from the fact that you said you had them?

323
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
<12-13,Rachel>-但是我没拿  -嗯  你应该拿
<12-13,Rachel>- But I didn't. - Well, you should have.

324
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,690
<12-14,Monica>-为什么  -因为
<12-14,Monica>- Why? - Because!

325
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,390
<12-16,Monica>为什么  因为每件事都是我的责任
<12-16,Monica>Why? Because everything is my responsibility?

326
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,480
<12-18,Monica>我为每个人做感恩节晚餐还不够吗
<12-18,Monica>Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone?

327
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,570
<12-18,Monica>每个人要的土豆泥都不一样
<12-18,Monica>You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes,

328
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,930
<12-18,Monica>我得做各种样式的土豆泥
<12-18,Monica>so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.

329
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,040
<12-18,Monica>有谁关心过我要哪种土豆泥吗
<12-18,Monica>Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?

330
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,830
<12-18,Monica>没有  没有
<12-18,Monica>Nooooo, no, no!

331
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,790
<12-18,Monica>菲比要加了豆子和洋葱的
<12-18,Monica>Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions,

332
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,430
<12-18,Monica>"马里奥"要土豆泥
<12-18,Monica>and Mario gets his tots,

333
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,300
<12-18,Monica>而这才是我第一次做感恩节晚餐
<12-18,Monica>and it's my first Thanksgiving,

334
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,250
<12-18,Monica>现在全焦了  我
<12-18,Monica>and it's all burned, and, and I... I...

335
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,830
<12-19,Chandler>好了  莫妮卡
<12-19,Chandler>Ok, Monica,

336
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,260
<12-19,Chandler>你现在的声音只有狗才能听出是什么
<12-19,Chandler>only dogs can hear you now, so, look,

337
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,310
<12-19,Chandler>门已经开了  进去吧
<12-19,Chandler>the door's open. Here we go.

338
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,310
<12-20,Monica>火鸡烧焦了
<12-20,Monica>Well, the turkey's burnt.

339
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,200
<12-20,Monica>这个土豆毁了  那个土豆毁了
<12-20,Monica>Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined,

340
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,920
<12-20,Monica>那个土豆也毁了
<12-20,Monica>potatoes are ruined.

341
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,240
<12-21,Ross>*我们来了  沿着*
<12-21,Ross>*Here we come, walkin' down the?*

342
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,190
<12-21,Ross>妈妈做的可不是这个味
<12-21,Ross>this doesn't smell like Mom's.

343
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,960
<12-22,Monica>不是是吧  你不是要土豆块吗  罗斯
<12-22,Monica>No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?

344
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,340
<12-22,Monica>好  拿去  兄弟  做好了
<12-22,Monica>Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.

<12-23,Rachel>哦  天哪  飞机已经起飞了
<12-23,Rachel>Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone,

346
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,960
<12-23,Rachel>看来我只能留下来和你们呆在一起了
<12-23,Rachel>so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.

347
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,940
<12-24,Joey>我们本来都有更好的计划的
<12-24,Joey>Hey, we all had better plans.

348
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,830
<12-24,Joey>这不是大伙的最初选择
<12-24,Joey>This was nobody's first choice.

349
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,220
<12-25,Monica>哦  真的吗
<12-25,Monica>Oh, really?

350
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,170
<12-25,Monica>那我何苦着急火燎的
<12-25,Monica>So why was I busting my ass

351
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,580
<12-25,Monica>给你们做这顿丰盛的感恩节大餐
<12-25,Monica>to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?

352
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,310
<12-26,Joey>你管这叫丰盛吗
<12-26,Joey>You call that delicious?

353
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,670
<12-27,Monica>闭嘴  闭嘴  闭嘴
<12-27,Monica>Stop it, stop it, stop it!

354
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,230
<12-28,Chandler>终于有了点感恩节的气氛了
<12-28,Chandler>Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

355
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,180
<12-29,Phoebe>-哦  -什么
<12-29,Phoebe>- Ooh. - What?

<12-30,Rachel>丑裸男正从烤箱中取出他的火鸡
<12-30,Rachel>Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.

357
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,410
<12-31,Phoebe>哦  我的天  丑裸男不是一个人
<12-31,Phoebe>Oh my God. He's not alone.

358
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,980
<12-31,Phoebe>他正和一个丑裸女共进感恩节晚餐
<12-31,Phoebe>Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Girl.

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,030

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,880
<12-45,Chandler>本来计划的感恩节
<12-45,Chandler>that all of you all planned,

377
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,070
<12-45,Chandler>但是对我来说  这样真的很好
<12-45,Chandler>but for me, this has been really great, you know,

378
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,380
<12-45,Chandler>我想因为这一次不会牵扯到任何
<12-45,Chandler>I think because it didn't involve

379
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,550
<12-45,Chandler>离婚或者呕吐之类的事情
<12-45,Chandler>divorce or projectile vomiting.

380
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,440
<12-45,Chandler>不论如何  我在想
<12-45,Chandler>Anyway, I was just thinking,

381
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,670
<12-45,Chandler>如果你去了韦尔
<12-45,Chandler>I mean, if you'd gone to Vail,

382
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,820
<12-45,Chandler>如果你们都和家人在一起
<12-45,Chandler>and if you guys'd been with your family,

383
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,260
<12-45,Chandler>如果你没有"梅毒"之类的
<12-45,Chandler>if you didn't have syphilis and stuff,

384
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,100
<12-45,Chandler>咱们就不可能聚在一起了  是吧

385
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,910
<12-45,Chandler>所以我想说的就是
<12-45,Chandler>So I guess what I'm trying to say is that

<12-45,Chandler>谢天谢地  你们的感恩节计划都砸了
