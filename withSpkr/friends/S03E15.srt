<6-15,Chandler>You know, just in case, maybe we should come up with set ground rules.

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,670
<6-16,Joey>对  那当然
<6-16,Joey>Yeah. For sure.

136
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,980
<6-16,Joey>最重要的原则就是  "绝对不要张开眼睛"
<6-16,Joey>Okay. Probably want the first one to be, "Never open your eyes."

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,700
<6-16,Joey>你可不想在做什么的时候
<6-16,Joey>Because you don't want to be doing something...

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,590
<6-16,Joey>抬头一看  对不对
<6-16,Joey>and then look up, right?

139
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,000
<6-16,Joey>看到你不想看的东西
<6-16,Joey>And see something that you don't want to be seeing.

140
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,730
<6-17,Chandler>说得好  不错
<6-17,Chandler>Good call. Nice.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,750
<6-17,Chandler>等等  等等
<6-17,Chandler>Hold it! Hold it!

142
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,780
<6-17,Chandler>万一我的眼睛闭上  然后
<6-17,Chandler>What if my eyes are closed, and...

143
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,870
<6-17,Chandler>我的手在那里...
<6-17,Chandler>and my hand is out there....

144
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,710
<6-18,Joey>好吧  眼睛不能闭着
<6-18,Joey>Okay, eyes open at all times!

145
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,630
<6-18,Joey>我们怎么决定
<6-18,Joey>How do we decide where we...

146
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,660
<6-18,Joey>哪个人
<6-18,Joey>you know, each would...

147
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,940
<6-18,Joey>要在
<6-18,Joey>you know...

148
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,400
<6-19,Chandler>哪里
<6-19,Chandler>be?

149
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,850
<6-19,Chandler>对  我们可以丢硬币决定
<6-19,Chandler>Right. Well, you know, we could flip for it.

150
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,980
<6-20,Joey>我想也是  不过头尾分别代表什么
<6-20,Joey>I guess. But like, what's heads and what's tails?

151
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,520
<6-21,Chandler>如果你连这个都不知道
<6-21,Chandler>If you don't know that,

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,660
<6-21,Chandler>我也不想跟你一起上了
<6-21,Chandler>then I don't want to do this with you.

153
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,960
<7-1,Rachel>不  订单就在我面前
<7-1,Rachel>No, no. I am looking at a purchase order right here...

154
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,490
<7-1,Rachel>上面说我们订的是里维拉比基尼
<7-1,Rachel>and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini

155
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,740
<7-1,Rachel>各种尺寸和颜色都有
<7-1,Rachel>in a variety of sizes and colors and...

156
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,430
<7-1,Rachel>这跟我穿什么有何相干
<7-1,Rachel>What does it matter what I'm wearing?

157
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,140
<7-1,Rachel>可以请你的主管过来吗  谢谢
<7-1,Rachel>Could I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you.

158
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,140
<7-2,Ross>等着
<7-2,Ross>We're hold.

159
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,140

<7-5,Sophie>你带了野餐篮  真是个好男朋友
<7-5,Sophie>You brought a picnic! What a boyfriend.

162
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,370
<7-5,Sophie>就这么定了  星期一我要开始化妆
<7-5,Sophie>That's it. On Monday, I start wearing makeup.

163
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,110
<7-6,Rachel>罗斯  亲爱的  你很体贴
<7-6,Rachel>Ross, honey, this is very nice,

164
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,040
<7-6,Rachel>但我现在大难临头
<7-6,Rachel>but I've got a crisis.

165
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,490
<7-7,Ross>但我这有蒸麦粉

<7-8,Rachel>但我在电话里跟你说过  我没有时间停下来
<7-8,Rachel>but I told you on the phone, I don't have time to stop.

169
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,740
<7-9,Ross>你不必停下来  我是隐形人  看不到
<7-9,Ross>Okay, you don't have to stop. I'm invisible. I'm not here.

<7-10,Rachel>Who approved that order?

172

<7-10,Rachel>我们这里没有马克·罗宾逊
<7-10,Rachel>Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.

<7-13,Rachel>038不是本店的号码
<7-13,Rachel>All right, see, 038 is not the number for this store.

<8-4,Rachel>我本来要给你机会向我道歉的
<8-4,Rachel>I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,850
<8-5,Ross>凭什么  凭你把我赶出办公室吗
<8-5,Ross>For what. For letting you throw me out of your office?

205
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,850
<8-6,Rachel>你没有权利到我办公室来  罗斯
<8-6,Rachel>You had no right coming down to my office, Ross.

206
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,550
<8-6,Rachel>你不能带着野餐篮到人家的办公室去
<8-6,Rachel>You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work...

207
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,180
<8-6,Rachel>除非那个人是公园管理员
<8-6,Rachel>unless maybe they're a park ranger!

<8-9,Ross>我觉得自己好像根本没有女朋友  瑞秋
<8-9,Ross>I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,240
<8-10,Rachel>罗斯  你到底想让我怎么做
<8-10,Rachel>Ross, what do you want from me?

214
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
<8-10,Rachel>你是不是要我辞职
<8-10,Rachel>Do you want me to quit my job...

215
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,430
<8-10,Rachel>好让你觉得自己有女朋友
<8-10,Rachel>so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

216
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,880
<8-11,Ross>不  我只希望你了解这只是一份工作
<8-11,Ross>No, but it would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.

217
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,920
<8-12,Rachel>-只是一份工作  -没错
<8-12,Rachel>- Just a job? - Yes.

<8-14,Rachel>罗斯  这是我人生中第一次
<8-14,Rachel>Ross, do you realise it's the first time in my life

219
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,970
<8-14,Rachel>做我真正喜欢的事

<8-15,Ross>我了解  我非常了解  也为你高兴
<8-15,Ross>I get that, okay? I get that big time, and I'm happy for you.

224
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,720
<8-15,Ross>但我受够了跟你的答录机谈恋爱
<8-15,Ross>But I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!

225
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,230
<8-15,Ross>我不知道该怎么办
<8-15,Ross>I don't know what to do any more!

226
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,960
<8-16,Rachel>我也不知道
<8-16,Rachel>Well, neither do I!

227
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,040
<8-17,Ross>这是因为马克吗
<8-17,Ross>Is this about Mark?

228
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,590
<8-18,Rachel>我的天

<8-21,Ross>天哪  你让我受不了
<8-21,Ross>No, you're making this too hard.

<8-21,Ross>我让你受不了  你要我怎么做
<8-21,Ross>I'm making this too hard? Okay, what do you want me to do?

234
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,460
<8-22,Rachel>我不知道  我不知道  这样吧
<8-22,Rachel>I don't know! I don't know! Look...

235
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,450
<8-22,Rachel>也许我们应该分开一下

236
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,610
<8-23,Ross>好吧  好吧

<9-1,Chloe>有了X5000   X50看起来就像T71
<9-1,Chloe>This X-5000 makes an X-50 look like a T-71.

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,780
<9-4,Chloe>我说我们不印  他说非印不可
<9-4,Chloe>We say we don't do that. He says, "You gotta."

250
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,820
<9-4,Chloe>知道吗  结果我们办到了
<9-4,Chloe>You know what? We did it.

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,930
<9-4,Chloe>现在有人要放大四倍

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,800
<9-8,Chandler>今晚不是你的周年纪念日吗

257
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,650
<9-9,Ross>计划略有改变
<9-9,Ross>A little change of plans.

258
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,830
<9-9,Ross>我们打算分手
<9-9,Ross>We're gonna break up instead.

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,630
<10-1,Monica>我还会说一点法文

269
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,790
<10-5,Phoebe>你没有说布特罗斯·布特罗斯-加利
<10-5,Phoebe>You didn't say "Boutros Boutros-Ghali."

312
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,960
<12-9,Joey>没怎么  他非常相信这回事
<12-9,Joey>Nothing. He just really believes in that.

313
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,740
<13-1,Rachel>然后我们大吵了一架  弄得很僵
<13-1,Rachel>Then we got into this big stupid fight it was awful.

314
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,310
<13-1,Rachel>我说他把我当公园管理员什么的
<13-1,Rachel>I told him he treats me like a park ranger, something....

315
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,340
<13-3,Rachel>然后
<13-3,Rachel>And then...

316
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,820
<13-1,Rachel>我告诉他我想分开
<13-1,Rachel>I told him I wanted to take a break.

322
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,330
<13-4,Mark>他大概只是出去了
<13-4,Mark>He's probably just out.
