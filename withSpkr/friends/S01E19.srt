<3-8,Rachel>我想跟有没有男人无关
<3-8,Rachel>I guess it's not about no guys.

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,710
<3-8,Rachel>而是没有遇到对的人
<3-8,Rachel>It's about the right guy, you know?

54
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,150
<3-8,Rachel>和巴瑞在一起轻松自在  但是没有激情
<3-8,Rachel>With Barry it was safe and easy, but there was no heat.

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,720
<3-10,Rachel>你认为我能两者同时拥有吗
<3-10,Rachel>Do you think you can have both?

59
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,740
<3-10,Rachel>一个既能当知己  又能给我激情的人
<3-10,Rachel>Someone who's your best friend but also can make your toes curl.

<3-11,Ross>通常你认为不可能让你
<3-11,Ross>Often, someone you wouldn't think could...

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,830
<3-11,Ross>感受到激情的人
<3-11,Ross>...curl your toes...

65
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,530
<3-11,Ross>却可能是
<3-11,Ross>... might just be the one who...

66
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,630
<3-13,Ross>被打断了
<3-13,Ross>...gets interrupted.

<3-20,Joey>I don't need violence in a movie...

73
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,350
<3-20,Joey>只要有裸体镜头我就满足了
<3-20,Joey>...as long as there's a little nudity.

195
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,780
<8-3,Ross>我就不该叫你照顾猴子练手
<8-3,Ross>I shouldn't have had you start with a monkey.

196
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,740
<8-3,Ross>应该要你从照顾钢笔铅笔开始才对
<8-3,Ross>I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.

197
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,780
<8-4,Rachel>罗斯  我已尽最大的努力

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,470
<8-9,Ross>马塞尔是非法的外来动物
<8-9,Ross>Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

204
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,750
<8-9,Ross>我无权在市内饲养他
<8-9,Ross>I'm not allowed to have him in the city.

<8-9,Ross>万一被他们找到  他们就会带走他
<8-9,Ross>If they find him, they'll take him away from me.

<8-10,Rachel>That' right. Because I never expected you

208
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,510
<8-11,Ross>你会请他们来家里
<8-11,Ross>to invite them to the apartment!

<8-15,Ross>我以为我们有养猴子  但是我们没有
<8-15,Ross>We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.

<8-22,Phoebe>那猴子是以你叔叔命名的吗
<8-22,Phoebe>ls that who the monkey's named after?

217
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,300
<8-23,Luisa>你知道持有非法外来动物
<8-23,Luisa>Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is

<8-25,Monica>saying things quietly to yourself first?

224
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,720
<8-26,Phoebe>记得  但总没有时间

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,530
<8-37,Luisa>说一句"早安  露易莎"有那么难吗
<8-37,Luisa>Would it have been hard to say, "Morning,Luisa"...

<11-5,Ross>他根本不认识路
<11-5,Ross>He doesn't know the Village!

296
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,790
<11-5,Ross>现在我的脚又受伤了
<11-5,Ross>And now I have a broken foot.

297

<11-5,Ross>猴子没了脚又受伤

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,060
<11-6,Rachel>你到底要我怎么样
<11-6,Rachel>What do you want me to do?

<11-6,Rachel>你要我的脚也受伤吗  我现在就来
<11-6,Rachel>You want me to break my foot too? I'll break it right now.

00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,490
<11-7,Ross>对  你踢完路标后
<11-7,Ross>Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...

304
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,580
<11-7,Ross>我突然不再想念马塞尔了
<11-7,Ross>... I don't miss Marcel anymore!

305
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,310
<11-8,Rachel>我真的不是故意的
<11-8,Rachel>It's not like I did this on purpose.

306
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,710
<11-9,Ross>当然  这是典型的瑞秋作风
<11-9,Ross>No, this is just vintage Rachel.

307
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,660
<11-9,Ross>这种事常发生在你身上
<11-9,Ross>Things just sort of happen around you!

308
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,070
<11-9,Ross>你活在瑞秋的世界中  做着瑞秋的事情
<11-9,Ross>You're off in "Rachel Land," doing your "Rachel Thing"...

309
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,980
<11-9,Ross>完全无视别人的猴子
<11-9,Ross>...total oblivious to people's monkeys

310
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,510
<11-9,Ross>或是别人的感觉
<11-9,Ross>or to people's feelings and

311
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,350
<11-11,Ross>-罗斯  -我不想听  就这么忘了吧
<11-11,Ross>- Ross. - I don't want to hear it! Forget it, okay?

315
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,670
<11-17,Phoebe>一边的屁股在睡觉  另一边却毫不知情
<11-17,Phoebe>One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.

<11-18,Ross>你有订香蕉吗
<11-18,Ross>Hi! Did you order some bananas?

<11-35,Mr. Heckles>那不是我的猴子 只有衣服是我的
<11-35,Mr. Heckles>That's not my monkey. The dress is mine.

<11-39,Luisa>- Oh, come on, Luisa. - Sorry, prom queen.

337
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,190
<11-40,Ross>你高中干嘛那么贱  为何不当个胖妞
<11-40,Ross>You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.

338
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,250
<11-39,Luisa>高中那会  我是舞会皇后
<11-39,Luisa>In high school, I was prom queen...

339
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,120
<11-41,Rachel>和返校节皇后  但是你
<11-41,Rachel>...and the homecoming queen and you...

340
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,640
<11-41,Rachel>你也在的啊
<11-41,Rachel>...were also there.

341
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,450
<11-41,Rachel>如果你把猴子带走
<11-41,Rachel>If you take this monkey,

342
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,900
<11-41,Rachel>我将失去我生命中重要的人
<11-41,Rachel>I'll lose an important person in my life.

343
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,340
<11-41,Rachel>你可以尽情恨我  但请别折磨他
<11-41,Rachel>You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.

344
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,970
<11-41,Rachel>别这样  露易莎
<11-41,Rachel>Come on, Luisa.

345
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,670
<11-41,Rachel>此时你有机会做一个宽容的人
<11-41,Rachel>You have a chance to be the bigger person here.

346
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,500
<11-42,Luisa>把握机会吧
<11-42,Luisa>Take it!

347
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,040
<11-42,Luisa>不
<11-42,Luisa>No.

348
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,800
<11-43,Rachel>那么  我只好告诉你的长官
<11-43,Rachel>All right. Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her...

349
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,720
<11-43,Rachel>你在我朋友的屁股上开了一枪
<11-43,Rachel>...you shot my friend with a dart!

350
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,700
<12-1,Ross>把这件衣服脱掉多好  是不是
<12-1,Ross>It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?

351
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,710
<12-1,Ross>或是这样穿着也不错
<12-1,Ross>Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

352
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,100
<12-2,Rachel>配上合适的女鞋  就是完美的一套了
<12-2,Rachel>With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

353
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,300
<12-3,Ross>抱歉  我之前对你这么凶
<12-3,Ross>Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before

354
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,360
<12-4,Rachel>不  罗斯  都是我的错  我差点弄丢
<12-4,Rachel>No, Ross, come in, it was my fault. I almost lost your

355
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,680
<12-5,Ross>是啊  但他也是你找回来的  你真厉害
<12-5,Ross>Yeah, but you got him back. You were great.

356
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,990
<12-5,Ross>那瓶酒还在
<12-5,Ross>We still have that bottle of wine.

357
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,070
<12-5,Ross>有心情喝杯葡萄酒吗
<12-5,Ross>Are you in the mood for something grape?

358
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,550
<12-6,Rachel>-好呀  -很好
<12-6,Rachel>- Sure, that would be good. - All right.

359
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,180
<12-7,Ross>隔壁一定在用吸尘器
<12-7,Ross>The neighbors must be vacuuming.

360
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,780
<12-7,Ross>只要我们在这儿就成
<12-7,Ross>Well, as long as we're here...

361
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,370
<12-7,Ross>不谈那个话题
<12-7,Ross>...and not on the subject....

362
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,290
<12-7,Ross>我在想
<12-7,Ross>I was thinking about...

363
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,990
<12-7,Ross>我们刚刚实在是恶言相向
<12-7,Ross>... how mad we got at each other before.

364
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,300
<12-7,Ross>大概是因为我们太
<12-7,Ross>And maybe it was partially because of how we
