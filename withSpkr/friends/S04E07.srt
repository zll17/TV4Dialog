1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,290
<1-1,Chandler>我刚撞见凯西光着身体
<1-1,Chandler>I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked!

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,320
<1-1,Chandler>真是酷刑
<1-1,Chandler>It was like torture.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,990
<1-2,Ross>要是你去打仗被俘  你就有福了
<1-2,Ross>Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured,you're in for a big surprise.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,460
<1-3,Chandler>事情越来越糟
<1-3,Chandler>It keeps getting worse and worse.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,350
<1-3,Chandler>爱上室友的女朋友已经够糟了
<1-3,Chandler>Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,000
<1-3,Chandler>而且我觉得她知道
<1-3,Chandler>which by the way, I think she knows.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,770
<1-3,Chandler>每次我们共处一室
<1-3,Chandler>Because Every time we're in the same room together,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,140
<1-3,Chandler>气氛就很诡异紧张
<1-3,Chandler>there's weird energy between us.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,080
<1-3,Chandler>就当我疯了  但我觉得她也喜欢我
<1-3,Chandler>Call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,550
<1-3,Chandler>现在我又看到她的裸体
<1-3,Chandler>And now I have seen her naked.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,410
<1-3,Chandler>她穿着衣服
<1-3,Chandler>At least with her clothes on

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,020
<1-3,Chandler>我还能想像她全身长满烂疮
<1-3,Chandler>I could imagine her body was covered in boils.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,690
<1-3,Chandler>结果没有  她很光滑
<1-3,Chandler>But there are no boils. She's smooth.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,230
<1-3,Chandler>很光滑
<1-3,Chandler>Smooth!

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,790
<1-4,Phoebe>-大家看到他的长袍走光了吗  -上帝啊
<1-4,Phoebe>Wow! Everyone totally see up his robe?  Oh, my God!

<2-5,Joey>Going out? Wow!

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,430
<2-6,Chandler>你跟凯西分手了  真可惜
<2-6,Chandler>So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,970
<2-7,Joey>没有啊  我们很好
<2-7,Joey>No, things are fine.

38
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,670

40
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,300
<2-9,Joey>最疯狂的是我刚吃完一整个披萨
<2-9,Joey>The craziest thing is, i just ate a whole pizza myself.

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,210
<2-10,Chandler>慢着  你要跟凯西见面
<2-10,Chandler>You're going out with kathy!

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,990
<2-12,Chandler>不断跟美女追求性爱
<2-12,Chandler>Sex with an endless line of beautiful

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,690
<2-12,Chandler>一定很空虚
<2-12,Chandler>women must be unfulfilling.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,530
<2-13,Joey>那又怎样  我们又不是唯一的
<2-13,Joey>What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,170
<2-14,Chandler>乔伊
<2-14,Chandler>Look, Joey.

49
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,740
<2-14,Chandler>凯西显然无法满足你的心灵
<2-14,Chandler>Kathy's not fulfilling your emotional needs.

50
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,170
<2-14,Chandler>但是凯希

184
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,620
<8-8,Phoebe>那就像骑脚踏车的猩猩
<8-8,Phoebe>It'd be like those

<9-18,Chandler>凯希也行  不  凯西
<9-18,Chandler>Could be Casey. No, Kathy.

215
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,700
<9-20,Chandler>考虑一下凯希
<9-20,Chandler>Consider Casey.

216
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,960
<9-21,Joey>看来有人在喜欢凯希喔
<9-21,Joey>I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.

<10-3,Ross>莫妮卡说你不想再表演了
<10-3,Ross>Monica tells me you don't want to play anymore because of me

222
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,460
<10-3,Ross>因为我和我的才华
<10-3,Ross>to play anymore rkure. very nice ...and, you know, my talent.

223
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,790
<10-3,Ross>是真的吗

224
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,670
<10-5,Ross>算是吧
<10-5,Ross>Well, kind of, yeah.

225
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,670
<10-6,Phoebe>我很想抱持无所谓乐观的态度
<10-6,Phoebe>I was trying to be really okay and upbeat about it

226
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,440
<10-6,Phoebe>但是你的音乐才华令我自惭形秽
<10-6,Phoebe>but I just feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.

227
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,610
<10-7,Ross>但是
<10-7,Ross>See, but

228
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,620
<10-7,Ross>菲比  这跟我做音乐的用意  正好相反
<10-7,Ross>Pheebs, that is the exact opposite intent of my music.

229
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,020
<10-7,Ross>我做音乐是想要启发人心
<10-7,Ross>You know, my music is meant to inspire.

230
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,190
<10-7,Ross>要是你这么困扰  那我
<10-7,Ross>If it bothers you this much

231
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,730
<10-7,Ross>我就不弹了
<10-7,Ross>then I won't play anymore.

232
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,190
<10-8,Phoebe>不要  不要  不要这样
<10-8,Phoebe>No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

233
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,370
<10-8,Phoebe>我怎么能让这个世界  失去你的音乐
<10-8,Phoebe>How could I live if I knew I was depriving the world of your music?

234
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,340
<10-9,Ross>那好吧
<10-9,Ross>Yeah, okay.

<11-3,Chandler>我吻了凯西
<11-3,Chandler>I kissed Kathy.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,330
<11-5,Monica>真的还假的
<11-5,Monica>Are you serious?

239
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,430
<11-6,Phoebe>乔伊知道吗  不知道
<11-6,Phoebe>-Does Joey know? -No.

240
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,400
<11-7,Chandler>你们想他有可能谅解吗
<11-7,Chandler>Is there any way you think he will understand this?

241
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,730
<11-8,Monica>你显然没有背叛过朋友
<11-8,Monica>You obviously haven't screwed over your friends.

242
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,810
<11-8,Monica>我们都很感激
<11-8,Monica>Which we all appreciate.

243
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,650
<11-9,Ross>要是你先坦承你的感觉再亲她
<11-9,Ross>If you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her

244
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,420
<11-9,Ross>乔伊一定会退让
<11-9,Ross>knowing Joey, he'd have stepped aside.

245
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,620
<11-10,Chandler>别这么说  这不是真的吧
<11-10,Chandler>Don't say that! That's not true, is it?

246
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,410
<11-12,Monica>真的啊  他爱你
<11-12,Monica>Yeah, he loves you.

247
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,250
<11-13,Chandler>那你们怎么不告诉我
<11-13,Chandler>Then why didn't you tell me to do that?

248
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,850
<11-14,Ross>我跟菲比聊过
<11-14,Ross>I said something to Phoebe.

249
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,760
<11-15,Phoebe>对  我觉得这是个好主意
<11-15,Phoebe>And I thought it was a really good idea.

250
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,990
<11-17,Monica>是的  我记得  天哪
<11-17,Monica>-Yeah, I remember. -Oh, my God!

251
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,330
<11-18,Chandler>我该怎么办
<11-18,Chandler>What am I going to do?

252
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,040
<11-20,Chandler>你得告诉他  为什么我要告诉他
<11-20,Chandler>-you'll have to tell him. -why do i have to tell him?

253
