165
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,210
<5-12,JOEY>为什么理查德抽起这个比我酷那么多
<5-12,JOEY>How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?

166
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,180
<5-13,ROSS>首先  或许你要点燃
<5-13,ROSS>Well for starters, you may want to light it

167
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,920
<5-13,ROSS>还有放下那支刮铲
<5-13,ROSS>and lose the spatula.

168
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,570
<5-14,MONICA>你想模仿理查德  我觉得很可爱
<5-14,MONICA>You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.

169
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,650
<5-15,JOEY>也不是这样  只是不要不像他
<5-15,JOEY>Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.

170
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,750
<5-16,ROSS>看  是以前叫钱德勒的那个艺术家
<5-16,ROSS>Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.

171
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,050
<5-17,CHANDLER>我不过是想试试看
<5-17,CHANDLER>Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.

172
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,760
<5-18,MONICA>乔伊  你为什么不留胡子
<5-18,MONICA>So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?

173
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,080
<5-19,JOEY>我们丢硬币决定的
<5-19,JOEY>Oh we flipped for it.

174
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,010
<5-19,JOEY>我丢到抽雪茄  他丢到留胡子
<5-19,JOEY>I got the cigar, he got the moustache.

175
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,150
<5-19,JOEY>我想我们都留的话  会有点蠢啦
<5-19,JOEY>Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.

176
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,750
<5-20,ROSS>是呀  你们真是躲过了一劫
<5-20,ROSS>Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.

<5-25,MONICA>我只是不知道哥们是你们
<5-25,MONICA>I just didn't know that you were the guys.

<5-28,MONICA>With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?

196
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,710
<6-3,ROSS>那也可以勉强说是二保姆的意思

<6-3,ROSS>帮我抱一下  好吗
<6-3,ROSS>Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec,

<6-7,ROSS>知道
<6-7,ROSS>Okay.

204
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,330
<6-9,ROSS>你可以像抱橄榄球那样抱他
<6-9,ROSS>Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.

205
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,750
<6-10,RACHEL>我就是这样抱橄榄球的
<6-10,RACHEL>This is how I would hold a football.

206
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,990
<6-11,ROSS>好吧  这样  对了
<6-11,ROSS>Ok, here, here. There we go.

<6-12,RACHEL>对不起  我不太会带孩子
<6-12,RACHEL>Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies.

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,220
<6-12,RACHEL>我没接触过他们
<6-12,RACHEL>I mean I haven't been around them,

209
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,090
<6-12,RACHEL>自我长大以后啦
<6-12,RACHEL>I mean, you know, since I was one.

210
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,090
<6-13,ROSS>没关系  没什么大不了的
<6-13,ROSS>It's alright, it's no big deal.

211
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,690
<6-14,RACHEL>真的
<6-14,RACHEL>Really?

212
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,440
<6-15,ROSS>当然了
<6-15,ROSS>Yeah, definitely,

213
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,690
<6-15,ROSS>我相信如果抱我们的宝宝
<6-15,ROSS>I'm sure you'll feel totally different

214
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,070
<6-15,ROSS>你的感觉会完全不同
<6-15,ROSS>when it's our baby.

215
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,150
<6-16,RACHEL>什么
<6-16,RACHEL>What?

216
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,270
<6-17,ROSS>什么
<6-17,ROSS>What?

217
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,740
<6-18,RACHEL>你会考虑这样的事吗
<6-18,RACHEL>You think about stuff like that?

218
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,760
<6-19,ROSS>对
<6-19,ROSS>Uhh, yeah.

219
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,920
<6-19,ROSS>我是说  事实上
<6-19,ROSS>I mean, actually

220
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,250
<6-19,ROSS>我想我们会有  有两个宝宝
<6-19,ROSS>I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.

221
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,970
<6-20,RACHEL>两个宝宝
<6-20,RACHEL>Two, two babies?

222
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,690
<6-21,ROSS>对  一男一女
<6-21,ROSS>Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl.

223
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,020
<6-21,ROSS>我希望先有女孩
<6-21,ROSS>Hopefully the girl will come first

224
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,860
<6-21,ROSS>这样本不会觉得有太大的竞争
<6-21,ROSS>so Ben here won't feel too competitive.

225
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,650
<6-22,RACHEL>那接下来呢
<6-22,RACHEL>Then what's gonna happen?

226
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,890
<6-23,ROSS>我们不希望孩子在城市里长大
<6-23,ROSS>Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city

227
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,050
<6-23,ROSS>所以我们或许会搬到史卡戴区
<6-23,ROSS>so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.

228
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,350
<6-24,RACHEL>我是想着
<6-24,RACHEL>Yeah, that way I figure,

229
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,900
<6-25,ROSS>这样住得离我们的父母够远
<6-25,ROSS>ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents

230
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,050
<6-25,ROSS>所以不用常常看到他们
<6-25,ROSS>that we don't have to see them all the time but

231
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,360
<6-25,ROSS>但又不会太远  随时可以请他们来带小孩
<6-25,ROSS>close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want.

232
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,830
<6-25,ROSS>没错  我知道那里的税要比
<6-25,ROSS>And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say,

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,330
<6-25,ROSS>拿骚县高一点  但教学制度据说非常棒
<6-25,ROSS>Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.

234
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,780
<6-26,RACHEL>哇  哇  太棒了
<6-26,RACHEL>Wow. Wow, that's great. Great.

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,850
<6-26,RACHEL>你知道吗
<6-26,RACHEL>Ok, wow, you know what.

236
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,030
<6-28,RACHEL>我休息时间结束了
<6-28,RACHEL>I'm off my break now so uh,

237
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,750
<6-28,RACHEL>所以你拿着这个
<6-28,RACHEL>um here you take this and um,

238
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,800
<6-28,RACHEL>我要去帮这些好人倒咖啡了
<6-28,RACHEL>I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.

239
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,330
<6-28,RACHEL>你瞧瞧  我没有咖啡壶
<6-28,RACHEL>Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot.

240
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
<6-28,RACHEL>我没有咖啡壶
<6-28,RACHEL>I don't have a pot. Well, hey,

241
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,560
<6-28,RACHEL>或许我家里有一个
<6-28,RACHEL>maybe I've got one at home,

242
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,130
<6-28,RACHEL>或在史卡戴区  那是门吗
<6-28,RACHEL>or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?

243
