45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,170
<1-20,Monica>这是保险欺诈
<1-20,Monica>That's insurance fraud.

52
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,020
<1-26,Monica>我替我朋友填资料时
<1-26,Monica>You see, I was filling out my friend's form,

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,210
<1-26,Monica>填的不是她的资料而是我的
<1-26,Monica>and instead of putting her information, I put mine.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,320
<1-27,Nurse>你真是个笨蛋
<1-27,Nurse>You are an idiot. .

<1-28,Monica>没错  这就是我  我就是那么笨
<1-28,Monica>Yep, that's me, I am that stupid.

56
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,930
<2-1,Ross>我昨晚梦见自己在和我儿子在玩橄榄球
<2-1,Ross>I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.

57
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,690
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>真温馨
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>That's nice.

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,500
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>不  他是球
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>No, no, with him.

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,820
<2-3,Ross>我在球场上  他们用我儿子开球
<2-3,Ross>I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,800
<2-3,Ross>我知道自己得做点什么
<2-3,Ross>And I, I know I've gotta do something

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,370
<2-3,Ross>因为坦帕湾队的防守球员逐渐逼近
<2-3,Ross>'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.

62
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,210
<2-4,Joey>坦帕湾队烂得要死
<2-4,Joey>Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,530
<2-5,Ross>没错  但只有我和我儿子
<2-5,Ross>Right, but, it is just me and the baby,

64
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,980
<2-5,Ross>我想我们死定了
<2-5,Ross>so I'm thinkin' they can take us.

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,080
<2-5,Ross>所以我只好把我儿子扔出去
<2-5,Ross>And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,040
<2-6,Chandler>什么  你疯啦  那是你儿子
<2-6,Chandler>What are you crazy? That's a baby!

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,290
<2-7,Joey>那他该擒杀吗
<2-7,Joey>He should take the sack?

68
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,570
<2-8,Ross>总之  突然我又到了前场
<2-8,Ross>Anyway, suddenly I'm down field,

69
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,620
<2-8,Ross>我发现该接住我儿子的人是我
<2-8,Ross>and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?

70
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,850
<2-8,Ross>但我绝对来不及赶过去
<2-8,Ross>Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time,

71
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,900
<2-8,Ross>于是我跑啊跑
<2-8,Ross>So I am running, and running,

72
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,720
<2-8,Ross>然后就惊醒了
<2-8,Ross>and that, that is when I woke up.

73
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,230
<2-8,Ross>看  我根本还没准备好当爸爸
<2-8,Ross>See I, I am so not ready to be a father.

74
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,070
<2-9,Chandler>你没问题的
<2-9,Chandler>Hey, you're gonna be fine.

75

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,270
<2-9,Chandler>你将来一定是个好爸爸的
<2-9,Chandler>You're gonna make a great dad.

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,180
<2-10,Joey>没错罗斯  你和你儿子只需要提高防守
<2-10,Joey>Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.

78
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,970
<2-11,Joey>你们去过彩虹厅吗
<2-11,Joey>Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room?

79
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,390
<2-11,Joey>真有那么贵
<2-11,Joey>Is it real expensive?

80
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,500
<2-12,Chandler>只有点东西吃才会贵
<2-12,Chandler>Well, only if you order stuff.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,700
<2-13,Joey>我今晚要带厄休拉去  今天是她生日
<2-13,Joey>I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.

82
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,220
<2-14,Ross>等等  菲比的生日该怎么办
<2-14,Ross>Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,650
<5-1,Mr. Geller>我很愿意在番茄干生意中分一杯羹
<5-1,Mr. Geller>I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business.

139
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,090
<5-1,Mr. Geller>五年前  如果有人说
<5-1,Mr. Geller>Five years ago, if somebody had said to me,

140

<5-1,Mr. Geller>我的蕃茄瘪得像干李子
<5-1,Mr. Geller>here's a tomato that looks like a prune,

142
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,040
<5-2,Ross>爸  我出生前  你有没有紧张
<5-2,Ross>Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?

143

<5-3,Mr. Geller>我不紧张  我是说
<5-3,Mr. Geller>I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying,

144
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,820
<5-3,Mr. Geller>如果有人来建议我做这个生意...
<5-3,Mr. Geller>if somebody had come to me with the idea and-

146
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,900
<5-4,Ross>我出生前你是否很紧张
<5-4,Ross>Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky,

147
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,470
<5-4,Ross>觉得"天啊我要当爹了"之类的
<5-4,Ross>"Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?

148
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,010
<5-4,Ross>不

<5-5,Mr. Geller>你妈妈全包办了  我又忙于公司
<5-5,Mr. Geller>Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business.

150
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,300
<5-5,Mr. Geller>经常不在家  你找我来是为了这个
<5-5,Mr. Geller>I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?

151
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,060
<5-6,Ross>不是  爸  我只是有点迷惑
<5-6,Ross>No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.

152
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,100
<5-7,Mr. Geller>因为我们还有时间弥补
<5-7,Mr. Geller>'Cause there's time to make up for that.

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,100
<5-8,Ross>我只是想知道
<5-8,Ross>I just needed to know,

158
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,800
<5-8,Ross>你何时起感觉自己像个父亲
<5-8,Ross>um when did you start to feel like a father?

159
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:39,620
<5-9,Mr. Geller>我想应该是
<5-9,Mr. Geller>Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,980
<5-9,Mr. Geller>你出生后第一天
<5-9,Mr. Geller>the day after you were born.

161
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,200
<5-9,Mr. Geller>我们在病房  你妈在睡觉

164
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,170
<5-9,Mr. Geller>你突然用拳头紧抓住我的手指
<5-9,Mr. Geller>and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist.

165
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,000
<5-9,Mr. Geller>紧紧捏住我的手指
<5-9,Mr. Geller>And you squeezed it, so tight.

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,830
<5-9,Mr. Geller>那时候我才感觉到
<5-9,Mr. Geller>And that's when I knew.

167
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,470
<5-10,Mr. Geller>所以你不想去威廉斯堡吗
