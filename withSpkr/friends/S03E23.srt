<1-1,Joey>We could call it Chuck.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,890
<1-5,Ross>洗身体时  感觉到了点什么
<1-5,Ross>...cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,590
<1-6,Chandler>是不是很像打喷嚏  只是感觉更爽
<1-6,Chandler>Was it like a sneeze, only better?

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,870
<1-7,Ross>不是  不是  是我身上长了东西

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,410
<1-9,Ross>看到的地方
<1-9,Ross>It's not visually accessible to me.

<1-15,Joey>不是  太皱了  不是痣
<1-15,Joey>No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,080
<1-16,Ross>那是什么 小脓包吗
<1-16,Ross>Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,850

<1-16,Ross>No, it's...

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,350
<1-17,Chandler>比小脓包高级
<1-17,Chandler>...fancier than a pimple.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,230

<2-17,Rachel>脚踏两条船  你不像这种人
<2-17,Rachel>Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,770
<2-18,Phoebe>我知道  我就像在游戏人间
<2-18,Phoebe>I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know?

60
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,560
<2-18,Phoebe>我把两男人玩弄于股掌间  跟他们谈情说爱
<2-18,Phoebe>I'm juggling two guys. I'm sowing my wild oats.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,600
<2-18,Phoebe>这样好像谈情说爱  游戏人间的花心萝卜
<2-18,Phoebe>You know, this kind of, like, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,750
<2-19,Joey>菲比  他们知道对方的存在吗
<2-19,Joey>So Pheebs, do they know about each other?

63
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,300
<2-20,Phoebe>狗狗念书时  嘴唇会动吗
<2-20,Phoebe>Does a dog's lips move when he reads?

64
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,330
<2-20,Phoebe>不  他们不知道
<2-20,Phoebe>Okay, no, they don't know.

65
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,750
<2-21,Ross>各位
<2-21,Ross>Hey, guys.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,430
<2-22,Joey>-怎么样  -医生怎么说
<2-22,Joey>- Well? - Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?

67
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,660
<2-24,Joey>他说完全没必要担心  绝对是良性的
<2-24,Joey>He said there's definitely nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.

68
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,110
<2-25,Chandler>-是什么  -他根本说不出来
<2-25,Chandler>- What is it? - He couldn't even tell me.

69
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,640
<2-27,Joey>他说是皮肤的一种
<2-27,Joey>Well, it's in the skin family.

70
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,570
<2-28,Ross>更糟的是他说  他说由于无法辨认
<2-28,Ross>And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it,

71
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,630
<2-28,Ross>他不愿意为我切除
<2-28,Ross>... he was reluctant to remove it.

72
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,370
<2-28,Ross>你应该去找我的医生
<2-28,Ross>Y'know what? You should go to my guy,

73
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,060
<2-29,Chandler>我因为长了第三个乳头去找他时
<2-29,Chandler>Because when I went in there with my third nipple...

74
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,990
<2-29,Chandler>他直接就把它给切了
<2-29,Chandler>...he just lopped it right off.

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,310
<2-29,Chandler>我蛮幸运的
<2-29,Chandler>So I guess I'm lucky.

76
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,210
<2-29,Chandler>虽然比不上天生就长两个乳头的人
<2-29,Chandler>I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.

77
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,150
<2-30,Ross>至少他们知道你长的是什么
<2-30,Ross>At least they knew what yours was. You know?

78
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,920
<2-30,Ross>你的有名字
<2-30,Ross>Yours had a name.

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,300
<2-31,Joey>也许医学界会以你命名那东西
<2-31,Joey>Maybe they'll name yours after you.

80
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,650
<2-31,Joey>把它称为"罗斯"
<2-31,Joey>You know? They'd call it "The Ross."

81
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,440
<2-31,Joey>以后大家会说"哟  他长了一个罗斯"
<2-31,Joey>And then people would be, like, "Oh,he's got a Ross."

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,150
<2-32,Ross>是啊  真酷
<2-32,Ross>Yeah, that'd be cool.

83
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,980
<3-1,Monica>彼特要跟我分手
<3-1,Monica>Pete's breaking up with me.

84
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,300
<3-2,All>什么
<3-2,All>What?

85
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,070
<3-3,Monica>我刚才听留言
<3-3,Monica>I just checked my messages.

86
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,470
<3-3,Monica>他说等他从亚特兰大回来"我们得谈一谈"
<3-3,Monica>He said that when he gets back from Atlanta, "We need to talk."

87
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,370
<3-5,Monica>-然后呢  -就这样
<3-5,Monica>- And? - Well, that's it.

88
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,990
<3-5,Monica>没有人会随便说"我们得谈一谈"
<3-5,Monica>People never say, "We need to talk,"

89
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,660
<3-5,Monica>除非是坏事
<3-5,Monica>unless it's something bad.

90
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,970
<3-6,Joey>那不一定代表他要跟你分手
<3-6,Joey>That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.

91
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,540
<3-7,Monica>真的吗
<3-7,Monica>Really?

92
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,000
<3-8,Joey>真的  也许他只是对你不忠
<3-8,Joey>Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.

93
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,150
<4-1,Jason>我知道我会一直做下去 但我得告诉你
<4-1,Jason>and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you,

94
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,510
<4-1,Jason>知道自己能改变一个孩子的人生  真的很棒
<4-1,Jason>it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.

95
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,280
<4-2,Phoebe>真好
<4-2,Phoebe>That is so great.

96
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,110
<4-4,Phoebe>天啊
<4-4,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

97
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,060
<4-4,Phoebe>天啊
<4-4,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

98
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,390
<4-5,Jason>-赶快通知消防队  -不行不行
<4-5,Jason>- We'd better call the fire department. -  No! No!

99
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,700
<4-7,Jason>-为什么不行  -不必找消防员吧
<4-7,Jason>- No, no?  -Well, we don't need a fireman.

100
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,660
<4-8,Phoebe>-应该找个能干的修理工来  -什么
<4-8,Phoebe>- We need, like, a good mechanic. - What?

101
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,340
<4-8,Phoebe>天啊  他们来了  我们快逃
<4-8,Phoebe>Oh my God! Here they come! We gotta get out of here!

102
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,610
<4-9,Jason>等一下  为什么
<4-9,Jason>Wait. Why?

103
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,710
<4-10,Phoebe>要是我想看消防员  我会直接找一个约会
<4-10,Phoebe>If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.

104
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,180
<5-1,Ross>其实很简单  就是个多出来的乳头
<5-1,Ross>That's all it is. A third nipple.

105
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,370
<5-1,Ross>很普通的第三个乳头
<5-1,Ross>You know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,270
<5-1,Ross>你可以把它切掉  直接切掉
<5-1,Ross>You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off.

107
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,180
<5-2,Dr. Rhodes>把上衣脱掉让我看一下什么情况
<5-2,Dr. Rhodes>Take your shirt off. Let's see what we're dealing with.

108
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,310
<5-2,Dr. Rhodes>你在干什么
<5-2,Dr. Rhodes>What are you doing?

109
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,050
<5-3,Ross>让你看那个非常普通
<5-3,Ross>Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,

110
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,350
<5-3,Ross>可以直接切掉的第三个乳头
<5-3,Ross>slice-it-right-off third nipple.

111
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,190
<5-4,Dr. Rhodes>这不是第三个乳头
<5-4,Dr. Rhodes>Well, that's not a third nipple.

112
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,760
<5-6,Dr. Rhodes>首先  它长在屁股上
<5-6,Dr. Rhodes>First of all, it's on your ass.

113
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,950
<5-7,Ross>不然是什么
<5-7,Ross>Well, then what is it?

114
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,550
<5-8,Dr. Rhodes>等一下  别动
<5-8,Dr. Rhodes>Wait a minute. Hold it.

115
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,130
<5-8,Dr. Rhodes>-詹森  来一下  -我跟汉弥顿说话呢
<5-8,Dr. Rhodes>- Johnson! Will you come in here a moment? - I'm with Hamilton!

116
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,560
<5-10,Dr. Rhodes>他对怪东西很在行  叫他也来
<5-10,Dr. Rhodes>He's good with weird things. Bring him in too.

117
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,450
<6-1,Monica>我得去帮彼特浇花
<6-1,Monica>I gotta go water Pete's plants.

118
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,750
<6-1,Monica>老实说
<6-1,Monica>You know what?

119
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,090
<6-1,Monica>如果他要跟我分手  那我就不去浇了
<6-1,Monica>If he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.

120
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,070
<6-2,Chandler>如果他要跟你分手
<6-2,Chandler>If he's gonna break up with you,

121
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,810
<6-2,Chandler>干脆让乔伊和我去给他"浇花"吧
<6-2,Chandler>maybe Joey and I should water his plants...

122
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,680
<6-2,Chandler>懂我的意思吧
<6-2,Chandler>...if you know what I mean.

123
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,350
<6-2,Chandler>或者...
<6-2,Chandler>Or...

124
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,170
<6-3,Joey>我们可以去他家  对着花盆撒尿
<6-3,Joey>we could go over there and pee on them.

125
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,110
<6-4,Phoebe>我受不了了
<6-4,Phoebe>I can't take it, you know.

126
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,370
<6-4,Phoebe>我好怕跟一个人约会时  被另一个人逮个正着
<6-4,Phoebe>I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one.

127
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,790
<6-4,Phoebe>我快疯了
<6-4,Phoebe>It's making me crazy!

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,370
<6-5,Rachel>何不跟其中一个分手
<6-5,Rachel>Why don't you break up with one of them?

129
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,480
<6-7,Joey>你不是在游戏人间吗
<6-7,Joey>What ah, what happened to playing the field?

130
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,180
<6-8,Phoebe>现在...现在不像游戏了
<6-8,Phoebe>Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore.

<9-9,Phoebe>And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like

<11-8,Phoebe>Well, for clubbing.

255
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,570
<11-8,Phoebe>很奇怪
<11-8,Phoebe>It is so weird.

256
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,700
<11-9,Monica>我说过不会答应  但是今天早上...
<11-9,Monica>I know what I said. But this morning...

257
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,890
<11-9,Monica>我躺在床上  想象着说"愿意"的感觉
<11-9,Monica>...I was lying in bed,I was, I was imagining what it'd be like to say yes.

258
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,590
<11-9,Monica>我知道有点突然  也很匆促
<11-9,Monica>I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed...

259
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,080
<11-9,Monica>而且我完全不是会做这种事的人
<11-9,Monica>and it's totally not like me to do something like this,

260
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,600
<11-9,Monica>但这不代表我不可以  对吧
<11-9,Monica>But it doesn't mean I can't. Right?

261
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,600
<11-9,Monica>毕竟我那么爱彼特
<11-9,Monica>I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

262
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,560
<11-9,Monica>我们追求同样的东西
<11-9,Monica>And I know that we want the same things.

263
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,590
<11-9,Monica>当我想到说"愿意"这两个字时
<11-9,Monica>And when I thought about saying yes...

264
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,980
<11-9,Monica>我觉得很快乐
<11-9,Monica>...it made me really happy.

265
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,590
<11-10,Rachel>天啊
<11-10,Rachel>Oh, my God!

266
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,570
<11-10,Rachel>我知道
<11-10,Rachel>I know.

267
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
<11-11,Monica>我还要派
<11-11,Monica>I need more pie.

268
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,940
<11-12,Phoebe>莫妮卡  要是你真的结婚
<11-12,Phoebe>Mon, if you do get married,

269
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,930
<11-12,Phoebe>我可以带两个男伴去吗
<11-12,Phoebe>can I bring two guests?

270
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,500
<11-13,Rachel>-你没跟消防员分手吗  -没有
<11-13,Rachel>- You didn't break up with that fireman? - No.

271
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,470
<11-14,Phoebe>我就是想通过这样告诉你们
<11-14,Phoebe>That was my way of telling you.

272
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,890
<11-14,Phoebe>原来他非常感性
<11-14,Phoebe>Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.

273
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,040
<11-14,Phoebe>他写日记  还画画
<11-14,Phoebe>He keeps a journal and he paints.

274
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,850
<11-14,Phoebe>他甚至为我画了一幅炭笔肖像画
<11-14,Phoebe>He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.

275
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,460
<11-16,Phoebe>他更想用水彩画
<11-16,Phoebe>He'd prefer watercolors,

276
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,390
<11-16,Phoebe>但你也知道  他拿黑炭更方便
<11-16,Phoebe>but y'know, he has easy access to a lot ofcharcoal.

277
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,580
<11-17,Monica>那你要甩掉杰森吗
<11-17,Monica>So then, are you going to dump Jason?

278
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,010
<11-18,Phoebe>对  我总得跟其中一个分手
<11-18,Phoebe>Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone.

279
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,430
<11-18,Phoebe>杰森很感性
<11-18,Phoebe>So Jason is sensitive.

280
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,290
<11-18,Phoebe>但现在  文斯也是
<11-18,Phoebe>But now, so is Vince.

281
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,820
<11-18,Phoebe>而文斯又有身材
<11-18,Phoebe>Plus, Vince has the body. You know?

282
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,390
<11-18,Phoebe>所以...
<11-18,Phoebe>So....

283
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,170
<11-18,Phoebe>这是纯算术问题
<11-18,Phoebe>It's really just about the math.

284
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,650
<12-2,Jason>-杰森  -请进
<12-2,Jason>- Jason. - Yeah, come on in.

<12-3,Jason>-出了什么事吗  -没事
<12-3,Jason>- is ah, is anything wrong? -  Nah-ha!

<13-5,Guru Saj>跟我想的一样  是昆度斯
<13-5,Guru Saj>As I suspected, it's a kundus.

296
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,550
<13-6,Ross>什么是"昆度斯"
<13-6,Ross>What's a "kundus"?

297
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,960

<13-7,Guru Saj>I don't know. What's a kundus with you?

00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,690
<13-7,Guru Saj>请趴下
<13-7,Guru Saj>Please lie down.

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,510
<13-7,Guru Saj>我有一种药膏可以让它立即缩小
<13-7,Guru Saj>I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.

300
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,320
<13-8,Ross>值得一试
<13-8,Ross>Okay. I guess it's worth a try.

301

<13-9,Guru Saj>那当然  效果应该...
<13-9,Guru Saj>Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!!

302
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,320
<13-9,Guru Saj>显然不能这么做
<13-9,Guru Saj>Clearly not the way to go!

303
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,640
<13-10,Ross>怎么了  怎么了
<13-10,Ross>What? What?

304
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,070

307
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,250
<13-13,Guru Saj>恐怕我们得动用更有力的手段
<13-13,Guru Saj>And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
