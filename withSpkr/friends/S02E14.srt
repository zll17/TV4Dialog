80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,100
<3-1,ROSS>这个凯西是谁
<3-1,ROSS>Hey, who's this Casey?

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,930
<3-2,PHOEBE>她看电影认识的人
<3-2,PHOEBE>Some guy she met at the movies.

82
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,630
<3-3,ROSS>是吗  他找她干什么
<3-3,ROSS>Really? What does he want with her?

83
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,910
<3-4,CHANDLER>我猜他想跟她跳点小舞
<3-4,CHANDLER>I guess he wants to do a little dance...

84
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,800
<3-4,CHANDLER>做点小爱
<3-4,CHANDLER>...you know, make a little love....

85

<3-4,CHANDLER>也许今晚就能推倒她
<3-4,CHANDLER>Well, pretty much get down tonight.

86
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,510
<3-4,CHANDLER>我不知道  我不懂

87
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,220
<3-5,ROSS>我不懂  两个月前  我们就差这么一丁点
<3-5,ROSS>I don't get it! Two months ago, Rachel and I were this close.

88
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,250
<3-2,PHOEBE>现在呢  我在替她看电影认识的人留言
<3-2,PHOEBE>Now I'm taking messages from guys she meets at the movies?

89
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,410
<3-5,ROSS>应该是这个凯西替我留言才对
<3-5,ROSS>I mean, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know?

90
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,230
<3-5,ROSS>要么我跟瑞秋应该在一起
<3-5,ROSS>Or Rachel and I should be together...

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,890
<3-5,ROSS>然后我们订个自助语音服务
<3-5,ROSS>...and we should get some kind of message service.

92
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,230
<3-6,PHOEBE>耐心点  会有那一天的
<3-6,PHOEBE>Hang in there. It's gonna happen.

00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,020
<3-7,ROSS>好  你怎么知道的
<3-7,ROSS>OK, now how do you know that?

94
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,340
<3-8,PHOEBE>因为她是你的龙虾
<3-8,PHOEBE>Because she's your lobster.

95
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,890
<3-9,CHANDLER>她这话有内涵
<3-9,CHANDLER>Oh, she's going somewhere.

96
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,280
<3-10,PHOEBE>谁不晓得  龙虾一旦恋爱  就会白头偕老
<3-10,PHOEBE>C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.

97
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,910
<3-10,PHOEBE>你真的可以看到老龙虾夫妻
<3-10,PHOEBE>You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples...

98
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,360
<3-10,PHOEBE>爪牵着爪  在水缸里散步
<3-10,PHOEBE>...walking around their tank, holding claws, like....

99
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,350
<3-11,CHANDLER>好点了吗
<3-11,CHANDLER>Hey, you feeling better?

100
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,010
<3-12,MONICA>我想这第五个澡应该把我面试的阴影给洗掉了
<3-12,MONICA>Yeah, I think that fifth shower got the interview off me.

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,820
<3-13,PHOEBE>还有其它可能性吗
<3-13,PHOEBE>Do you have other possibilities?

102
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,650
<3-14,MONICA>有  有可能我会交不上房租
<3-14,MONICA>Yeah. There is the possibility that I won't make rent.

103
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,420
<3-15,ROSS>摩妮卡  需要的话  我可以借你点钱
<3-15,ROSS>Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.

104
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,240
<3-16,MONICA>不用  如果我没有办法马上还
<3-16,MONICA>No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away

105
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,420
<3-16,MONICA>我看到你就会紧张内疚
<3-16,MONICA>then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,280
<3-17,ROSS>那你要不跟爸妈借吧
<3-17,ROSS>Then why not borrow it from Mom and Dad?

107
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,480
<3-17,ROSS>反正你看到他们本来就会紧张内疚
<3-17,ROSS>You feel guilty and tense around them already.

108
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,120
<3-17,ROSS>还不如趁机会跟他们刮点钱
<3-17,ROSS>Might as well make some money off of them.

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,800
<3-18,CHANDLER>他说得很有道理
<3-18,CHANDLER>The man's got a point.

110
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,370
<3-19,PHOEBE>那个闪闪发光的是什么东西
<3-19,PHOEBE>What is that sparkly thing?

111
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,870
<3-20,CHANDLER>那个是...
<3-20,CHANDLER>That thing, it's a uhh. . .

112
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,800
<3-20,CHANDLER>对  是有点俗气
<3-20,CHANDLER>Yeah, it's a little flashy.

113
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,880
<3-20,CHANDLER>没有
<3-20,CHANDLER>No, no.

114
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,060
<3-21,ROSS>才不会  对道上兄弟来讲不可不俗气
<3-21,ROSS>No, no. It's not flashy. Not for a goodfella.

115
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,000
<3-22,MONICA>真够犀利的
<3-22,MONICA>Man, that is sharp!

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,890
<3-22,MONICA>你一定花了不少达布隆金币吧
<3-22,MONICA>That must have cost you quite a few doubloons.

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,420
<9-6,MRS. GELLER>杰克  你看  你觉得很好笑的油漆广告来了
<9-6,MRS. GELLER>Jack, look! There's that house paint commercial that cracks you up!

245
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
<9-7,MONICA>-你去哪里了 -人间炼狱
<9-7,MONICA>- Where have you been? - Emotional hell.

246
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,980
<9-8,ROSS>他们有没有借你钱
<9-8,ROSS>So, did they lend you the money yet?

247
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,070
<9-9,MONICA>没  可能是因为我还没开口
<9-9,MONICA>No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.

248
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,510
<9-10,ROSS>快去  摩妮卡  去说吧
<9-10,ROSS>Come on, Monica, do it.

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,140
<9-10,ROSS>爸妈
<9-10,ROSS>Hey, you guys.

250
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,380
<9-10,ROSS>摩妮卡有事要宣布
<9-10,ROSS>Monica has some news.

251
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,430
<9-11,MONICA>抱歉我以前没告诉你们
<9-11,MONICA>So listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but...

252
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,530
<9-11,MONICA>我现在失业了  我被迫离职了
<9-11,MONICA>... I'm no longer at my job. I had to leave it.

253
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,120
<9-12,MRS. GELLER>为什么
<9-12,MRS. GELLER>Why?

254
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,710
<9-13,MONICA>公司的决定
<9-13,MONICA>Because they made me.

255
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,760
<9-14,MRS. GELLER>你被炒鱿鱼  那你准备怎么办
<9-14,MRS. GELLER>You were fired? What are you gonna do?

256
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,010
<9-15,MR. GELLER>朱迪  放心  这可是我们的小妮妮宝贝
<9-15,MR. GELLER>Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica we're talking about.

257
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,630
<9-15,MR. GELLER>我们教导有方
<9-15,MR. GELLER>We taught her well.

258
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,230
<9-15,MR. GELLER>-薪水的百分之十上哪儿去了  -存银行了
<9-15,MR. GELLER>- Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go? - In the bank.

259
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,900
<9-17,MR. GELLER>这就对了  她在吃她的老本  存钱就是应急用的
<9-17,MR. GELLER>There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for.

260
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,230
<9-17,MR. GELLER>她不会有事的
<9-17,MR. GELLER>She's gonna be fine.

261
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,050
<9-17,MR. GELLER>如果那些钱还不够用的话
<9-17,MR. GELLER>And if you need a little extra,

262
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,810
<9-17,MR. GELLER>你知道哪里有钱
<9-17,MR. GELLER>...you know where to find it.

263
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,080
<9-18,MONICA>有面额大一点的吗
<9-18,MONICA>Anything larger back there?

264
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,660
<10-1,CHANDLER>真不敢相信
<10-1,CHANDLER>I can't believe it!

265
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,740
<10-2,PHOEBE>别有怨天尤人了好吗
<10-2,PHOEBE>Would you stop already?

266
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,450
<10-2,PHOEBE>别再闷闷不乐了  高兴一点
<10-2,PHOEBE>Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.

267

<10-3,CHANDLER>你说得对  我应该高兴一点
<10-3,CHANDLER>Oh, you're right. I should play in the hay.

268
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,810
<10-3,CHANDLER>忘了我刚才花了四百块
<10-3,CHANDLER>Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars

269
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,260
<10-3,CHANDLER>去买一个我讨厌的手镯这件事
<10-3,CHANDLER>to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with.

270
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,620
<10-3,CHANDLER>逗我开心啊
<10-3,CHANDLER>Bring on the hay!

271

<10-4,RACHEL>我有个能让你开心起来的东西
<10-4,RACHEL>I've got something that'll make you happy.

<10-12,CHANDLER>No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you

281
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,130
<10-12,CHANDLER>我也知道这不只是首饰而已
<10-12,CHANDLER>and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,

282
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,930
<10-12,CHANDLER>事关你跟我  还有我们是"好兄弟"
<10-12,CHANDLER>It's about you and me and the fact that we're "best buds."

283
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,050
<10-13,JOEY>这是友谊的象征吗  我觉得是

<12-1,MONICA>我高中时穿的泳衣  我那时体型有点大
<12-1,MONICA>That's my bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then.

295
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,690
<12-2,CHANDLER>我还以为是给康涅狄格州挡雨用的呢
<12-2,CHANDLER>I thought they used that to cover Connecticut when it rains.

296
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,410
<12-3,JOEY>摩妮卡  这带子里有什么
<12-3,JOEY>Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?

<12-11,RACHEL>我隔膜长歪了 不得已只好去缩鼻了
<12-11,RACHEL>They had to reduce it because of my deviated septum.

305
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,880
<12-12,CHANDLER>我错了  那才是用来给康涅狄格州遮雨的
<12-12,CHANDLER>Okay, I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.
