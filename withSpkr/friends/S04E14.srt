00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,590
<1-7,Joey>去年剩的一块三明治
<1-7,Joey>A hunk of sandwich from last year.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,390
<1-8,Ross>盖勒钓到了  看来是条大鱼
<1-8,Ross>Geller's got one hooked! Looks like a big one!

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,470
<1-8,Ross>经典的人鱼大战...
<1-8,Ross>It's the classic struggle between man...

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,380
<1-8,Ross>不知是谁撞倒了台灯
<1-8,Ross>Someone knocked over a lamp.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,250
<1-9,Joey>知道今年去钓鱼时  最妙之处是什么吗
<1-9,Joey>You guys know what'll be great about the fishing trip this year?

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,340
<1-9,Joey>每次到了湖心我爸都会问我
<1-9,Joey>When my dad ask me in the middle of the lake, give me that,

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,380
<1-9,Joey>"你最近都在忙什么"之类的问题
<1-9,Joey>"Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff,

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,270
<1-9,Joey>这次我可以说  我要跟查尔顿·赫斯顿演电影
<1-9,Joey>I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston, dad.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,500
<1-9,Joey>你在忙些什么呢
<1-9,Joey>What are you doing with your life?"

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,860
<1-11,Chandler>怎么我一出来你们就不说笑了
<1-11,Chandler>You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here.

18
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,090
<1-11,Chandler>凯西又没有背叛你们所有人
<1-11,Chandler>Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,800
<1-11,Chandler>当然  除了你
<1-11,Chandler>Well, except you.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,080
<1-12,Monica>乔伊  你不该丢下钱德去钓鱼
<1-12,Monica>Hey Joey, I don't think you should leave Chandler alone.

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,610
<1-12,Monica>他跟凯西才分手两天
<1-12,Monica>It's only been 2 days since he broke up with Kathy.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,220
<1-12,Monica>下周再去钓鱼吧
<1-12,Monica>Maybe you should go fishing next week.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,150
<1-13,Joey>可我现在又帮不上忙
<1-13,Joey>Look. There's nothing I can do for him right now.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,110
<1-13,Joey>他还穿着运动裤
<1-13,Joey>He's still in his sweats.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,740
<1-13,Joey>这才是第一阶段
<1-13,Joey>That's only phase one.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,460
<1-13,Joey>等他到第二阶段的时候我就回来了
<1-13,Joey>I'll be back for phase two.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,750
<1-13,Joey>我从不错过第二阶段
<1-13,Joey>I'd never miss that.

28
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,770
<1-14,Monica>什么第二阶段
<1-14,Monica>What's phase two?

29
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,980
<1-15,Joey>喝个烂醉  去脱衣舞俱乐部
<1-15,Joey>Getting drunk and going to a strip club.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,710
<1-16,Rachel>那样怎么会有帮助
<1-16,Rachel>How does going to a strip clab make him better?

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,210
<1-17,Ross>那里有裸女
<1-17,Ross>There are naked ladies there.

32
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,200
<1-18,Joey>这有助于他过渡到第三阶段
<1-18,Joey>And it helps to get to phase three:

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,440
<1-18,Joey>对别的女人产生性幻想
<1-18,Joey>picturing yourself with other women.

34
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,320
<1-19,Ross>那个阶段也有裸女
<1-19,Ross>There are naked ladies there too.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,330
<1-19,Ross>就不能让我清静一小会儿吗
<1-19,Ross>Would you give me one minute, please?

51
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,860
<2-1,Joshua>这是跟上周你挑的外套搭配的吗
<2-1,Joshua>So these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,530
<2-2,Rachel>这就对了
<2-2,Rachel>There we go.

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,120
<2-2,Rachel>就是这样

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,290
<3-36,Ross>真难决定啊
<3-36,Ross>That is a toughie.

135
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,860
<3-37,Monica>她到走廊了
<3-37,Monica>She's looking down the hall.

136
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,500
<3-37,Monica>她直勾勾地盯着我呢
<3-37,Monica>She looked right at me.

137
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,910
<3-37,Monica>透过猫眼是看不到的  对吧
<3-37,Monica>You can't see people through that hole, can you?

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,270
<3-38,Woman>-你好啊  -你好啊
<3-38,Woman>- Hello. - Hello.

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,630
<3-39,Rachel>马上就来  罗斯  拜托啦
<3-39,Rachel>I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please, come on.

140
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,730
<3-39,Rachel>我觉得我们应该都已经走出来了
<3-39,Rachel>I thought we had moved on.

141
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,570
<3-39,Rachel>我觉得我们已经可以彼此祝福了
<3-39,Rachel>I thought we come to a place where we could be happy for each other.

142
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,490
<3-39,Rachel>难道只有我走出来了
<3-39,Rachel>I mean, was that just me?

143
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,900
<3-40,Ross>好吧  我带她去
<3-40,Ross>All right, I'll do it.

144
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,870
<3-41,Rachel>谢谢你  谢谢
<3-41,Rachel>Thank you, thank you.

145
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,770
<3-42,Emily>-艾蜜莉  -我是
<3-42,Emily>- Emily. - Yes.

146
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,260
<3-43,Rachel>我是瑞秋·格林
<3-43,Rachel>I'm Rachel Green.

147
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,590
<3-44,Emily>谢天谢地
<3-44,Emily>Thank goodness!

148
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,310
<3-45,Rachel>计划有小小的变动
<3-45,Rachel>There's been a teeny teeny change of plans.

149
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,970
<3-45,Rachel>我今晚临时有事...所以...
<3-45,Rachel>Turns out I'm not free tonight...so...

150
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,900
<3-45,Rachel>是吗
<3-45,Rachel>Really?

151
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,100
<3-46,Emily>太好了  我一定是没接到电话
<3-46,Emily>That's just lovely, isn't it. I must've missed your call,

152
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,010
<3-46,Emily>虽然我整天都没出门
<3-46,Emily>even though I didn't leave the flat all day.

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,780
<3-47,Rachel>我
<3-47,Rachel>Well, l...

154
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,330
<3-47,Rachel>不  这也没什么
<3-47,Rachel>No no no. That's not rude.

155
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,150
<3-48,Emily>自打我来到这里就诸事不顺...
<3-48,Emily>It's perfectly in keeping with the trip...

156
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,090
<3-48,Emily>先是被你们的热狗车撞倒
<3-48,Emily>where I've already been run down by one of your wiener cars...

157
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,800
<3-48,Emily>在肯尼迪国际机场又被脱衣服搜身
<3-48,Emily>and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport,

158
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,190
<3-48,Emily>你们美国人显然认为
<3-48,Emily>apparently to you people,

159
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,020
<3-48,Emily>我长得就像屁股里
<3-48,Emily>I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine

160
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,320
<3-48,Emily>塞了可卡因的人
<3-48,Emily>stuffed up their bum.

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,910
<3-49,Monica>我觉得你很漂亮啊
<3-49,Monica>I think you look great.

162
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,550
<3-50,Emily>晚安  很高兴认识你们
<3-50,Emily>Good night. It was very nice to meet you all.

163
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
<3-51,Rachel>我去追她
<3-51,Rachel>I'll get her.

164
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,880
<3-52,Ross>快去吧
<3-52,Ross>Please, hurry.

165
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,850
<3-53,Phoebe>他们讲话好好玩
<3-53,Phoebe>Don't you just love the way they talk?

166
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,680
<4-3,Phoebe>-怎么了  -宝宝在踢我
<4-3,Phoebe>- What? - It kicked, I think the baby kicked!

167
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,630
<4-4,Monica>天啊
<4-4,Monica>Oh, my God.

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,620
<4-5,Phoebe>不对  是内裤的松紧带断了
<4-5,Phoebe>No, wait. The elastic in my underwear busted.

169
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,020
<4-4,Monica>完了  我睡过头了
<4-4,Monica>Oh, my God! I overslept!

170
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,700
<4-6,Joey>半小时前就应该到的
<4-6,Joey>I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago!

171
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,270
<4-6,Joey>我得赶快
<4-6,Joey>I gotta get out of here!

172
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,030
<4-7,Monica>乔伊  你不能这样去  你臭死了
<4-7,Monica>Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!

173
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
<4-8,Joey>我没洗澡就睡过去了
<4-8,Joey>Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
<4-8,Joey>现在没时间了
<4-8,Joey>and now I don't have time!

175
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
<4-8,Joey>才十条街  跑过去还来得及
<4-8,Joey>It's just 10 blocks away. If I run, I can make it.

176
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,360
<4-9,Monica>跑十条街  那你不是更臭了吗
<4-9,Monica>Run 10 blocks. That'll help the smell.

177
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,790
<4-10,Rachel>慢一点  不  快走吧
<4-10,Rachel>Slow down! No, keep moving.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,010
<4-11,Monica>昨晚怎么样啊
<4-11,Monica>How did it go with Joshua last night?

179
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,030
<4-12,Rachel>我没见到约书亚
<4-12,Rachel>Well, I didn't see Joshua.

180
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,280
<4-12,Rachel>但我照着一个女孩的脸给了一拳
<4-12,Rachel>But I did punch a girl in the face.

181
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,420
<4-14,Phoebe>-什么  -什么
<4-14,Phoebe>- What? - What?

182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,090
<4-15,Rachel>昨晚真的很倒霉  大雨倾盆
<4-15,Rachel>The whole night was horrible. It was pouring down raining.

183
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,230
<4-15,Rachel>而到现场我却发现名单上没有瑞秋·格林
<4-15,Rachel>And when I got there, there was no Rachel Greene on the list.

184
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,160
<4-15,Rachel>但有一个瑞秋·格皮
<4-15,Rachel>But there was a Rachel Greep.

185
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,300
<4-16,Phoebe>那你见到她了吗
<4-16,Phoebe>So did you get to meet her?

186
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
<4-17,Rachel>根本没这个人
<4-17,Rachel>No. There is no Rachel Greep.

187
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,080
<4-17,Rachel>但有个女生听到了
<4-17,Rachel>But then, this other girl overheard us.

188
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,180
<4-17,Rachel>大叫"我就是瑞秋·格皮"
<4-17,Rachel>And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!"

189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,610
<4-17,Rachel>结果门卫就让她进去了
<4-17,Rachel>And he let her right in.

190
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,770
<4-18,Monica>然后你就打了她的脸
<4-18,Monica>So you hit her in the face?

191
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,160
<4-19,Rachel>打不着了  她已经进去了
<4-19,Rachel>No, she was already in.

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
<4-19,Rachel>可后来我身后一个五大三粗的婆娘
<4-19,Rachel>But then this big bitch behind me

193
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,480
<4-19,Rachel>要偷我的伞...
<4-19,Rachel>tried to steal my umbrella...

194
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,200
<4-19,Rachel>我就给了她点颜色瞧瞧
<4-19,Rachel>so I clocked her.

195
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,580
<4-19,Rachel>真是的  我只想在工作之余
<4-19,Rachel>I can't believe this. All I wanted was just a few hours...

196
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,820
<4-19,Rachel>跟约书亚相处一下
<4-19,Rachel>outside of work to see Joshua...

197
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,740
<4-19,Rachel>好让他有机会爱上我
<4-19,Rachel>so that he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.

198
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,280
<4-20,Phoebe>菲
<4-20,Phoebe>Pheebs.

199
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,410
<4-21,Rachel>那是你的名字
<4-21,Rachel>Honey, that's your name.

200
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,080
<4-22,Phoebe>原来这是菲比的简称啊
<4-22,Phoebe>That's short for Phoebe?

201
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,850
<4-22,Phoebe>我以为那是我们之间的爱称
<4-22,Phoebe>I thought that's what we called each other.

202
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,690
<4-23,Monica>-你穿上裤子了  -没错
<4-23,Monica>- You're wearing pants! - That's right.

203
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,570
<4-24,Chandler>我那几位兄弟呢
<4-24,Chandler>Where are the guys?

204
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,290
<4-24,Chandler>我准备好借酒消愁和看脱衣舞了
<4-24,Chandler>I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.

205
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,140
<4-25,Monica>才早上9点半
<4-25,Monica>It's 9:30 in the morning.

206
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,560
<4-26,Chandler>那里的早餐是自助式的
<4-26,Chandler>They got a breakfast buffet.

207
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,650
<4-27,Monica>你好  是罗斯啊
<4-27,Monica>Hello. Oh, hey, Ross!

208
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,670
<4-28,Chandler>让我和他说
<4-28,Chandler>Let me talk to him!

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,330
<4-30,Chandler>-天哪  -我能不能...
<4-30,Chandler>- Oh, my God! - Can't I just...?

210
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,450
<4-31,Monica>等等  你说什么
<4-31,Monica>Wait, what?

211
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,200
<4-32,Chandler>她嘘我  那是我的电话  她还嘘我
<4-32,Chandler>She shushs me. It's my phone and she's shush...

212
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,750
<4-32,Chandler>别吵
<4-32,Chandler>Please!

213
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,960
<4-33,Phoebe>他说什么
<4-33,Phoebe>What's he saying?

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,310
<4-34,Monica>他跟艾蜜莉投宿在佛蒙特  在一起吃早餐呢
<4-34,Monica>He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!

215
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,820
<4-35,Phoebe>什么  天哪
<4-35,Phoebe>What? Oh, my God!

216
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,220
<4-36,Rachel>艾蜜莉是谁  不会吧
<4-36,Rachel>Who the hell is Emily...? No.

217
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,790
<5-1,Rachel>他们在佛蒙特  怎么会
<5-1,Rachel>They're in Vermont? How was this happen?

218
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,820
<5-3,Rachel>他怎么会跟那个丑巫婆去佛蒙特
<5-3,Rachel>How...how did he end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!

219
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,120
<5-4,Chandler>也许因为她没有一直打他吧
<5-4,Chandler>Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,530
<6-1,Ross>罗斯  快来
<6-1,Ross>Ross, come quickly.

221
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,050
<6-2,Emily>外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果
<6-2,Emily>There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!

222
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,720
<6-2,Emily>我要挂了
<6-2,Emily>I got to go!

223
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,970
<6-2,Emily>外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果
<6-2,Emily>There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!

224
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,430
<6-4,Monica>他挂了
<6-4,Monica>He had to go.

225
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,590
<6-2,Emily>外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果
<6-2,Emily>There was a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.

226
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,340
<6-5,Rachel>我真不理解  她那么难看
<6-5,Rachel>I don't get this. She was horrible!

227
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,830
<6-6,Chandler>我站到那边去好了
<6-6,Chandler>I'm going to go stand over there.

228
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,680
<6-7,Monica>你干嘛这么在乎
<6-7,Monica>Why do you care so much anyway?

229
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,060
<6-7,Monica>我才不在乎
<6-7,Monica>I don't care.

230
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,670
<6-8,Rachel>我只是因为自己跟约书亚没进展而懊恼
<6-8,Rachel>I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

231
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,110
<6-8,Rachel>但怎么也不应该刚一认识
<6-8,Rachel>You know what, still, you do not just meet someone

232
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,920
<6-8,Rachel>就一起跑去佛蒙特啊
<6-8,Rachel>and go flitting off to Vermont!

233
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,670
<6-9,Monica>你和贝利不是刚一认识就跑去维尔了吗
<6-9,Monica>When you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.

234
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,470
<6-10,Rachel>你能不能偶尔有一次
<6-10,Rachel>Could you, just for once...

235
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,100
<6-10,Rachel>不要什么小事都记那么清楚吗
<6-10,Rachel>not remember every little thing?

236
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,820
<6-11,Chandler>他什么时候回来
<6-11,Chandler>So you know, when's he getting back?

237
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,480
<6-12,Monica>过一两天吧
<6-12,Monica>A couple of days.

238
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,910
<6-13,Chandler>我就知道会这样
<6-13,Chandler>I knew something like this would gonna happen.

239
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,670
<6-14,Monica>你干什么
<6-14,Monica>What are you doing?

240
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,100
<6-14,Monica>钱德勒  你的阶段不能倒退的呀
<6-14,Monica>Chandler. You can't just go back a phase!

241
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,850
<6-15,Chandler>有何不可  你指的是时间的概念
<6-15,Chandler>Yes, you can. You're thinking about time.

242
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,430
<6-15,Chandler>时间才不能倒流
<6-15,Chandler>You can't go back in time.

243
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,420
<6-16,Phoebe>我们跟你去进行第二阶段好了
<6-16,Phoebe>Why don't you do your phase two strip club thing with us?

244
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,490
<6-17,Monica>对呀  我们可以当你的好兄弟
<6-17,Monica>Yeah, come on, we can be guys!

245
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,940
<6-18,Chandler>你们不行
<6-18,Chandler>No, you can't.

246
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,420
<6-19,Phoebe>让我们当嘛  我们很想试试当男人的感觉
<6-19,Phoebe>Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys.

247
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,610
<6-19,Phoebe>可千万别这么想
<6-19,Phoebe>No, you don't want to be guys.

248
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,940
<6-20,Chandler>全身是毛还短命
<6-20,Chandler>You'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.

249
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,970
<6-21,Phoebe>能不能别这么懦弱  把运动裤脱掉
<6-21,Phoebe>Would you just stop being such a wuss and get those off?

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,520
<7-3,Joey>你看  查尔顿·赫斯顿在嚼甘草糖
<7-3,Joey>Look at that. Charlton Heston eating licorice.

257
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,680
<7-4,The A.D>他很爱嚼甘草糖  从没见过他...
<7-4,The A.D>Yeah, he loves them. I've never seen him with...

258
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,040
<7-5,Joey>搞什么  什么东西这么臭
<7-5,Joey>What the hell is that? What smells so bad?

<7-6,The A.D>You?

260
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,340
<7-7,Joey>你这么想不奇怪  不过你知道到底是谁吗
<7-7,Joey>I could see why you would think that. But you know who it is?

261
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,140
<7-8,The A.D>是你
<7-8,The A.D>You.

262
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,410
<7-9,Joey>不  是赫斯顿
<7-9,Joey>No, no. It's Heston.

263
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,400
<7-10,The A.D>什么
<7-10,The A.D>What?

264
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,380
<7-11,Joey>他臭得好像去钓了三天鱼
<7-11,Joey>The man reeks like he went on a three-day fishing trip,

265
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,950
<7-11,Joey>然后还嚼甘草
<7-11,Joey>and then ate licorice.

266
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,150
<7-12,The A.D>不可能
<7-12,The A.D>There's no way he smells.

267
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,940
<7-12,The A.D>只有他的休息室里有浴室
<7-12,The A.D>He's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.

268
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,250
<7-13,Joey>真的  有浴室
<7-13,Joey>Really? A shower?

269
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,600
<7-13,Joey>是哪一间
<7-13,Joey>And...which room might that be?

270
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,140
<7-14,The A.D>门口写着"赫斯顿"的那间
<7-14,The A.D>The one with "Heston" on it.

<7-15,Joey>有意思
<7-15,Joey>Interesting.

<8-1,Monica>I got some ones. You want to put them in her panties?

273
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,270
<8-2,Chandler>不用了  娘

<8-2,Chandler>噢  不行  那烟
<8-2,Chandler>Oh, no. That.

275
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,270
<8-3,Phoebe>你得熄掉  因为我是孕妇
<8-3,Phoebe>You have to put that out because I'm pregnant.

276
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,900
<8-4,The Cigarette Smoking Guy>也许你和你的孩子应该去别家脱衣舞俱乐部
<8-4,The Cigarette Smoking Guy>Maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.

277
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,030
<8-5,Phoebe>这才不是我的孩子
<8-5,Phoebe>It's not my baby.

281
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,510
<8-8,Rachel>我还以为
<8-8,Rachel>You'd think he'd be worried about me

282
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,100
<8-8,Rachel>我没出现在现场  他会担心呢
<8-8,Rachel>not showing up in his club.

283
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,120
<8-8,Rachel>更糟的是
<8-8,Rachel>You know what makes it so much worse?

284
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,020
<8-8,Rachel>罗斯正在佛蒙特风流快活
<8-8,Rachel>Ross is all happy in Vermont.

<8-12,Monica>记得提醒我去问那个人的名字
<8-12,Monica>Don't let me leave without the name of that carpet guy.

289
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,700
<8-12,Monica>拜托
<8-12,Monica>Come on!

290
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,400
<8-13,Chandler>算了  我要回家给凯西打电话
<8-13,Chandler>You know what? I'll go home and call Kathy.

291
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,490
<8-14,Phoebe>也许是个好办法
<8-14,Phoebe>Oh, I think it'll help.

292
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,100
<8-15,Chandler>错  我这是在考验你们
<8-15,Chandler>No. That was a test.

293
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,240
<8-15,Chandler>再过几小时我会烂醉
<8-15,Chandler>In a couple hours, I'll be really drunk.

<8-15,Chandler>I'm gonna wanna to call Kathy. You'll have to stop me.

295
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,600
<8-15,Chandler>而再之后我就会醉得完全失去理智
<8-15,Chandler>And then after that I'll be so drunk,

296
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,070
<8-15,Chandler>甚至想给珍妮丝打电话

<9-11,Charlton Heston>every actor thinks he stinks.

317
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,200
<9-11,Charlton Heston>连劳伦斯·奥利弗有时也会这么想
<9-11,Charlton Heston>Even Laurence Olivier sometimes thought he stank.

320
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,870

324
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,650
<9-15,Charlton Heston>在演艺生涯中都曾说过"天哪  我真烂"
<9-15,Charlton Heston>who, one time in his career, didn't say, "God, I stink!"

325
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,670
<9-15,Charlton Heston>我刚拍完一场戏
<9-15,Charlton Heston>I just did a scene out there.

<10-6,Monica>他不喜欢别人叫他乔旭吗
<10-6,Monica>What? He doesn't like "Josh"?

<10-9,Phoebe>不要啦  你说得对
<10-9,Phoebe>No! Wait, wait. You know what? You were right.

341
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,690
<10-9,Phoebe>我们当男生当得不好  知道原因吗
<10-9,Phoebe>We really weren't great at being guys. You know why?

342
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,500
<10-10,Chandler>因为我们是女生
<10-10,Chandler>Because we're girls.

343
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,310
<10-11,Phoebe>-你知道女生最擅长什么  -跳脱衣舞
<10-11,Phoebe>- You know what girls are really good at? - Stripping!

345
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,130

346
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,860
<10-13,Phoebe>如果你肯一吐为快  或许就没事了
<10-13,Phoebe>Maybe it just would really, really help if you would just talk.

347
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,170
<10-14,Rachel>是啊  你心里到底在想什么
<10-14,Rachel>Yeah, come on. What's going on in there?

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,130
<10-15,Monica>你想哭也没关系  哭吧
<10-15,Monica>And you know, if you want to cry, that's okay too.

349
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,470
<10-16,Chandler>别这样  再这样我只能请你们都离开
<10-16,Chandler>I'm going to have to ask you all to leave.

350
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,360
<10-17,Monica>钱德勒
<10-17,Monica>Chandler.

351
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,680
<10-18,Chandler>算了  我们试过了  但第三阶段没希望了
<10-18,Chandler>Forget it. We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.

352
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,780
<10-18,Chandler>那些舞娘都很火辣
<10-18,Chandler>Those strippers were insanely hot,

353
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,920
<10-18,Chandler>我却无法产生性幻想
<10-18,Chandler>and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.

354
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,570
<10-19,Monica>她们真的很漂亮
<10-19,Monica>They really were pretty, weren't they?

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,170
<10-21,Monica>她真是生气蓬勃
<10-21,Monica>She was so spunky!

357
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,230
<10-22,Phoebe>要是我要跟女人在一起...
<10-22,Phoebe>I think if I were going to be with a woman...

358
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,250
<10-23,Monica>我会选蜜雪儿那型的
<10-23,Monica>it'd be with someone like Michelle.

359
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,920
<10-23,Monica>她好娇小
<10-23,Monica>She was just so petite.

360
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,980
<10-24,Rachel>不知道  不过我觉得我会选香塔儿
<10-24,Rachel>See, I don't know. For me, it would have to be Chantal.

361
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,420
<10-25,Monica>-香塔儿  -天呐
<10-25,Monica>- Chantal! - Oh my God.

<10-26,Rachel>She had the smoothest skin.

363
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,160
<10-26,Rachel>我塞钱给她时  手擦过她的丁字裤和大腿
<10-26,Rachel>I stuck that dollar bill in her G-string and grazed her thigh...

364
