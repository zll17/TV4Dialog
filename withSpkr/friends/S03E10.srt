<3-10,Phoebe>我忘了  我现在完全反对这件事
<3-10,Phoebe>I forgot. I am totally against that now.

55
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,470
<3-11,Joey>什么  反对我有工作吗
<3-11,Joey>What? Me having a job?

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,820
<3-12,Phoebe>不  我反对无辜的树木
<3-12,Phoebe>No, I am against innocent trees

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,170
<3-12,Phoebe>在其青春正盛的时候被砍下
<3-12,Phoebe>being cut down in their prime...

<3-12,Phoebe>而尸体还被装饰得怪模怪样
<3-12,Phoebe>and their corpses grotesquely dressed...

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,780
<3-12,Phoebe>挂上一堆金箔和闪灯
<3-12,Phoebe>in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

<3-12,Phoebe>你晚上睡得好吗

<3-13,Joey>我拖着树  走来走去累得要命
<3-13,Joey>Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around.

62
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,650
<3-13,Joey>菲比  你完全搞错了
<3-13,Joey>Hey, Phoebe, listen, you got this all wrong.

63
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,540
<3-13,Joey>那些树生来就是要当圣诞树的
<3-13,Joey>Those trees were born to be Christmas trees.

64
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,710
<3-13,Joey>通过为人们带来欢乐来实现生命的价值
<3-13,Joey>They're fulfilling their life purpose by making people happy.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,930
<3-14,Phoebe>真的
<3-14,Phoebe>Really?

66
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,860
<3-14,Phoebe>没错
<3-14,Phoebe>Yes!

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,980
<3-15,Chandler>对  这些树也很高兴
<3-15,Chandler>Yes, and the trees are happy too...

68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,140
<3-15,Chandler>因为对大多数的树来说  这是它们
<3-15,Chandler>because for most of them, it's their only...

69
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,870
<3-15,Chandler>见识纽约的唯一机会
<3-15,Chandler>chance to see New York.

70
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,950
<4-1,Gunther>送完饮料之后  把空盘子...
<4-1,Gunther>After you deliver the drinks, you take the empty tray

71
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,370
<4-2,Rachel>甘瑟  拜托  我在这里做了两年半
<4-2,Rachel>Gunther, please. I have worked here for two and a half years.

72
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,030
<4-2,Rachel>我知道空盘子要放在这里
<4-2,Rachel>I know the empty trays go over there.

73
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,120
<4-3,Gunther>放在这里怎么样
<4-3,Gunther>What if you put them here?

74
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,170
<4-4,Rachel>这倒是个好主意
<4-4,Rachel>You know, that's actually a really good idea.

75
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,970
<4-4,Rachel>离马克杯比较近
<4-4,Rachel>Because that way they'll be closer to the mugs.

76
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,440
<4-4,Rachel>你应该要其他服务生也照办
<4-4,Rachel>You know what? You should have the other waitresses do that too.

77
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,140
<4-5,Gunther>她们本来就是这么放的
<4-5,Gunther>They already do.

78
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,500
<4-5,Gunther>所以她们管这里叫盘子区
<4-5,Gunther>That's why they call it the tray spot.

79
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,040
<4-6,Rachel>天哪  我总听她们说这个
<4-6,Rachel>Jeez, I always heard them talk about that.

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,840
<4-6,Rachel>我还以为是她们参加的俱乐部  天哪
<4-6,Rachel>I sort of just thought it was, like, a club they went to. Oh, God.

81
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,190
<4-7,Gunther>-对不起  -没关系
<4-7,Gunther>- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

<5-1,Ross>So this must be kind of neat for you, huh?

84
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,890
<5-1,Ross>你爸爸说你可以不用上学
<5-1,Ross>Your dad tells me you get a couple days off school...

85
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,350
<5-1,Ross>也不必再去卖饼干了
<5-1,Ross>and you don't have to sell those cookies anymore.

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,880
<5-2,Sarah>我很想去卖饼干
<5-2,Sarah>Well, I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

<5-2,Sarah>坐上真正的太空飞船
<5-2,Sarah>and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

<5-4,Sarah>如果我帮他清洁公寓的时间
<5-4,Sarah>if I'd spend as much time helping him clean apartments...

92
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,930
<5-4,Sarah>和我做太空白日梦的时间一样多
<5-4,Sarah>as I do daydreaming about outer space...

93
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,750
<5-4,Sarah>他就有钱去泰姬陵了
<5-4,Sarah>he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.

94
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,900
<5-5,Ross>我想要清洁非常多的公寓
<5-5,Ross>I think you'd have to clean a whole lot of apartments

95
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,010
<5-5,Ross>才有钱去印度
<5-5,Ross>to go all the way to India.

96
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,050
<5-6,Sarah>不  是大西洋城的赌场

<5-6,Sarah>他说会把奶奶留给我上大学的钱翻倍
<5-6,Sarah>He says he's gonna double the college money my grandma left me.

<5-7,Ross>那就祝爸爸好运吧
<5-7,Ross>Well, good luck to Dad.

<5-14,Sarah>But I'd rather have something my dad couldn't sell.

110
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,570
<5-15,Ross>这也对

115
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,390

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,860
<7-3,Phoebe>我发觉也许我是有点太主观了
<7-3,Phoebe>and I realize maybe I was a little judgmental.

136
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,870
<7-3,Phoebe>对  可是...
<7-3,Phoebe>Yeah. Oh, but, oh.

137
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,200
<7-4,Joey>菲比  记住
<7-4,Joey>Now, now, Phoebe, remember...

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,630
<7-4,Joey>它们只是在实现他们的圣诞
<7-4,Joey>they're just fulfilling their Christmas

139
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,200
<7-5,Phoebe>-宿命  是的  -没错
<7-5,Phoebe>- Destiny. Yes. - Sure.

140
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,300
<7-7,Phoebe>那棵看起来好像很空虚
<7-7,Phoebe>That one doesn't look very fulfilled.

141
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,670
<7-9,Phoebe>那是老树了  他只是把树拿到后面罢了
<7-9,Phoebe>That's one of the old ones. He's just taking it to the back.

142
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,020
<7-11,Phoebe>你们把老树放在后面
<7-11,Phoebe>You keep the old ones in the back?

143
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,520
<7-11,Phoebe>真是年龄歧视
<7-11,Phoebe>That is so ageist.

144
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,240
<7-12,Joey>这样才有地方放新鲜的树
<7-12,Joey>We have to make room for the fresh ones.

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,230
<7-13,Phoebe>那老的怎么办
<7-13,Phoebe>So what happens to the old guys?

146
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,650
<7-14,Joey>拿去切碎
<7-14,Joey>Well, they go into the chipper.

147
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,100
<7-15,Phoebe>我有种非常不祥的预感
<7-15,Phoebe>I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds.

148
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,010
<7-15,Phoebe>不要
<7-15,Phoebe>No, no!

149
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,590
<8-1,Ross>这些是你们最喜欢的圣诞人物的形状
<8-1,Ross>And these come in the shapes of your favorite Christmas characters.

150
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,310
<8-1,Ross>圣诞老人  鲁道夫  和耶稣宝宝
<8-1,Ross>Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

151
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,370
<8-2,Joey>我要一盒奶油馅的耶稣宝宝
<8-2,Joey>All right, I'll take a box of the cream-filled Jesuses.

152
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,260
<8-3,Ross>等等  就买一盒
<8-3,Ross>Wait a minute, one box?

153
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,740
<8-3,Ross>这可是为了送一个可怜的小女孩去太空营啊
<8-3,Ross>Come on, I'm trying to send a poor little girl to Space Camp.

154
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,410
<8-3,Ross>我算你五盒  钱德勒  你呢
<8-3,Ross>I'm putting you down for 5 boxes. Chandler, what about you?

155
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,000
<8-4,Chandler>好吧  你有没有椰子口味的神
<8-4,Chandler>All right. Do you have any coconut-flavored deities?

156
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,810
<8-5,Ross>没有  但光明节烛台形状的有椰子口味
<8-5,Ross>No, but there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

157
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,670
<8-5,Ross>这样吧  我算你八盒
<8-5,Ross>I'll tell you what. I'll put you down for 8 boxes.

158
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,850
<8-5,Ross>一晚一盒
<8-5,Ross>One for each night.

159
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,240
<8-6,Ross>莫妮卡
<8-6,Ross>Mon?

160
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,540
<8-6,Ross>好吧  我要一盒薄荷口味的
<8-6,Ross>All right, I'll take one box of the Mint Treasures.

161
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,100
<8-7,Monica>一盒就好了
<8-7,Monica>One, and that's it.

162
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,630
<8-7,Monica>我参加棕鸟之后就胖了
<8-7,Monica>I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.

163
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,580
<8-7,Monica>记得吗  爸爸买光了我的饼干
<8-7,Monica>Remember? Dad bought every one of my boxes

164
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,750
<8-7,Monica>我全吃掉了
<8-7,Monica>and I ate them all.

165
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,710
<8-8,Ross>不  莫妮卡  爸不得不买下所有饼干
<8-8,Ross>No, Mon. Dad had to buy every one of your boxes...

166
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,380
<8-8,Ross>因为你全吃光了
<8-8,Ross>because you ate them all.

167
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,240
<8-8,Ross>但是  我确定这次一定不会这样了
<8-8,Ross>But, you know, I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.

168
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,340
<8-8,Ross>不如我给你算三盒薄荷
<8-8,Ross>Why don't I just put you down for 3 of Mint Treasures

169
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,220
<8-8,Ross>两盒鲁道夫吧
<8-8,Ross>and just a couple of Rudolphs?

170
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,360
<8-9,Monica>不要
<8-9,Monica>No.

171
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,380
<8-10,Ross>好啦  你知道你很想吃
<8-10,Ross>Oh, come on, now. You know you want them.

172
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
<8-11,Monica>不要这样
<8-11,Monica>Don't do this.

173
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,480
<8-12,Ross>这样吧  莫妮卡  第一盒算我送你的
<8-12,Ross>I'll tell you what, Mon. I'll give you the first box for free.

174
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,370
<8-13,Monica>老天  我得走了
<8-13,Monica>Oh, God! I gotta go!

175
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,090
<8-14,Ross>来嘛  好孩子都吃这种饼干
<8-14,Ross>Come on! All the cool kids are eating them.

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,020
<9-1,Gunther>等你待会儿有空的时候
<9-1,Gunther>And when you have a second later,

177
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,500
<9-1,Gunther>我会告诉你为什么不能
<9-1,Gunther>I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders...

178
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,120
<9-1,Gunther>把蜘蛛困在马克杯底下就算了
<9-1,Gunther>under coffee mugs and leave them there.

179
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,360
<9-2,Rachel>我痛恨这工作  却还要努力改进
<9-2,Rachel>I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.

180
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,700
<9-2,Rachel>我的人生算是完了
<9-2,Rachel>My life officially sucks!

181
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,970
<9-3,Joey>瑞秋  这不是暂时性的工作吗
<9-3,Joey>But Rach, wasn't this supposed to be a temporary thing?

182
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,170
<9-3,Joey>我以为你的目标是打入时装界
<9-3,Joey>I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.

183
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,430
<9-4,Rachel>对  我还在朝目标前进
<9-4,Rachel>Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

184
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,470
<9-5,Chandler>你是怎么前进的
<9-5,Chandler>How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

185
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,460
<9-5,Chandler>除了两年前寄过简历以外
<9-5,Chandler>You know, other than sending out resumes, like, what? Two years ago?

186
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,710
<9-6,Rachel>我还传达了
<9-6,Rachel>Well, I'm also sending out...

187
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,760
<9-6,Rachel>好点子
<9-6,Rachel>good thoughts.

188
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,760
<9-7,Joey>要我说  只要你还保有这份工作
<9-7,Joey>If you ask me, as long as you got this job...

189
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,380
<9-7,Joey>就没有找新工作的动机
<9-7,Joey>you got nothing pushing you to get another one.

190
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,200
<9-7,Joey>你需要的是恐惧
<9-7,Joey>You need The Fear.

191
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,160
<9-8,Rachel>-恐惧  -他说得对
<9-8,Rachel>- The Fear? - He's right.

192
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,290
<9-9,Chandler>辞掉这份工作才有动机
<9-9,Chandler>If you quit this job, you then have motivation

193
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,850
<9-9,Chandler>追求你心目中理想的工作
<9-9,Chandler>to go after a job you really want.

194
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,490
<9-10,Rachel>你为何还在做你讨厌的工作
<9-10,Rachel>Then how come you still at a job that you hate?

195
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,480
<9-10,Rachel>干嘛不辞职来产生恐惧
<9-10,Rachel>Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

196
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,810
<9-11,Chandler>因为我太害怕了
<9-11,Chandler>Because I'm too afraid.

197
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,750
<9-11,Chandler>我不知道
<9-11,Chandler>I don't know.

198
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,290
<9-12,Rachel>我愿意不顾一切的为设计师
<9-12,Rachel>I mean, I'd give anything to work for a designer,

199
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,560
<9-12,Rachel>或采购人工作
<9-12,Rachel>you know, or a buyer.

200
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,370
<9-12,Rachel>我不想到了30岁还在这里工作
<9-12,Rachel>I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.

201
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,820
<9-13,Chandler>对  那要比28岁还在这工作惨多了
<9-13,Chandler>Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here.

202
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,530
<9-15,Rachel>-瑞秋  -干嘛
<9-15,Rachel>- Rachel? - Yeah.

203
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,050
<9-16,Gunther>提醒我跟你复习哪壶是低因咖啡
<9-16,Gunther>Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf

204
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,830
<9-16,Gunther>哪壶是普通的
<9-16,Gunther>and which is regular.

205
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,690
<9-17,Rachel>看把手看不出来吗
<9-17,Rachel>Can't I just look at the handles on them?

206
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,140
<9-18,Gunther>想得美
<9-18,Gunther>You would think.

207
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,280
<9-19,Rachel>好了  甘瑟  你知道吗
<9-19,Rachel>Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?

208
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,930
<9-19,Rachel>我是个很差劲的服务生
<9-19,Rachel>I am a terrible waitress.

209
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,750
<9-19,Rachel>你知道这是为什么吗  因为我不在乎
<9-19,Rachel>Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because I don't care.

210
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,430
<9-19,Rachel>我不在乎  我不在乎哪壶是普通咖啡
<9-19,Rachel>I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular

211
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,260
<9-19,Rachel>哪壶是低因咖啡
<9-19,Rachel>and which pot is decaf.

212
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,130
<9-19,Rachel>我不在乎盘子区在哪里
<9-19,Rachel>I don't care where the tray spot is.

213
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,280
<9-19,Rachel>我就是不在乎  这不是我想做的工作
<9-19,Rachel>I just don't care. This is not what I want to do.

214
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,000
<9-19,Rachel>所以我想我不该再做下去了
<9-19,Rachel>So I don't think I should do it anymore.

215
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,990
<9-20,Gunther>-我正式提出辞呈  -什么
<9-20,Gunther>- I'm giving my week's notice. - What?

216
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,960
<9-21,Rachel>甘瑟  我辞职
<9-21,Rachel>Gunther, I quit.

217
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,540
<9-22,Chandler>这表示以后喝咖啡要付钱了吗
<9-22,Chandler>Does this mean we have to start paying for coffee?

218
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,710
<9-22,Chandler>好  12
<9-22,Chandler>Okay, twelve.

221
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,110
<10-1,Ross>干嘛
<10-1,Ross>What?

222
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,040
<10-2,Chandler>我拼出了"咪咪"
<10-2,Chandler>I spelled out "boobies".

223
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,040
<10-3,Monica>罗斯  再给我一盒薄荷口味的好吗
<10-3,Monica>Ross, Put me down for another box of the Mint Treasures, okay?

224
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,040
<10-3,Monica>薄荷饼干在哪里
<10-3,Monica>Where are the Mint Treasures?

225
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,030
<10-4,Ross>没有了  都卖光了
<10-4,Ross>We're out. I sold them all.

226
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,500
<10-5,Monica>什么
<10-5,Monica>What?

227
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,480
<10-6,Ross>莫妮卡  我不能再让你吃下去了
<10-6,Ross>Monica, I'm cutting you off.

228
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,800
<10-6,Ross>不行  不要
<10-6,Ross>No, No.

229
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,380
<10-7,Monica>再给我两盒就好
<10-7,Monica>Just a couple more boxes.

230
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,450
<10-7,Monica>这也没什么  我很好
<10-7,Monica>It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

231
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,900
<10-7,Monica>你得帮我再弄两盒
<10-7,Monica>You gotta help me with a couple more boxes!

232
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,920
<10-8,Ross>莫妮卡  看看你自己  你脖子上还有饼干
<10-8,Ross>Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.

233
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,880
<10-9,Monica>老天
<10-9,Monica>Oh, God!

234
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,740
<10-10,Chandler>-你卖了多少盒了  -你看
<10-10,Chandler>- So how many you sold so far? - Check this out.

236
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,940
<10-12,Chandler>老天  你怎么办到的
<10-12,Chandler>Oh, my God! How did you do that?

237
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,150
<10-13,Ross>那天晚上  我离开博物馆的时候
<10-13,Ross>Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum...

238
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,510
<10-13,Ross>天文馆正在放镭射佛洛依德
<10-13,Ross>just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium.

239
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,460
<10-13,Ross>我随随便便就卖了50盒
<10-13,Ross>Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!

240
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,170
<10-13,Ross>这时我想到
<10-13,Ross>That's when it occurred to me.

241
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,740
<10-13,Ross>成功的关键就是"饥饿感"
<10-13,Ross>The key to my success: The munchies.

242
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,840
<10-13,Ross>所以我开始在午夜时分去纽约大学的宿舍
<10-13,Ross>So I started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.

243
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,140
<10-13,Ross>那饼干简直是论箱卖
<10-13,Ross>I am selling cookies by the case.

244
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,970
<10-13,Ross>他们叫我"饼干佬"
<10-13,Ross>They call me "Cookie Dude"!

245
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,020
<10-14,Rachel>放下手边的事
<10-14,Rachel>Okay, stop what you're doing.

246
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,700
<10-14,Rachel>我需要人帮我塞信封  舔邮票...
<10-14,Rachel>I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers....

247
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,310
<10-15,Ross>谁帮你写的简历
<10-15,Ross>Who did these resumes for you?

248
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,160
<10-16,Chandler>我  用我的电脑写的
<10-16,Chandler>Me. On my computer.

249
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,100
<10-17,Ross>你这字体还真够大的
<10-17,Ross>You sure used a large font.

250
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,300
<10-18,Chandler>对  "咖啡馆的服务生"
<10-18,Chandler>Yeah. Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse"...

251
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,500
<10-18,Chandler>和"啦啦队副队长"占不了多少空间
