00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,330
<1-5,PHOE>摩妮卡  拔掉电话线  拿酒来
<1-5,PHOE>Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,170
<1-5,PHOE>瑞秋  结局是好是坏
<1-5,PHOE>Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,400
<1-6,RACH>结局非常好
<1-6,RACH>It ended very well.

<1-7,PHOE>等我来再讲  等我来再讲
<1-7,PHOE>Do not start without me! Do not start without me!

<1-8,MNCA>先说那个吻
<1-8,MNCA>Okay. All right. Let's hear about the kiss.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,350
<1-9,PHOE>是轻拂过你嘴唇的轻吻呢
<1-9,PHOE>Was it like a soft brush against your lips...

12
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,210
<1-9,PHOE>还是欲火焚身的那种吻呢
<1-9,PHOE>...or was it like a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,900
<1-10,RACH>刚开始很炽热  然后...
<1-10,RACH>Well, at first it was really intense, you know? And then....

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,370
<1-10,RACH>天啊  然后我们就完全沉醉了
<1-10,RACH>Oh, God. And then we just sort of sunk into it.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,150
<1-11,PHOE>他抱着你吗  还是手搭在你的背上
<1-11,PHOE>So was he holding you? Or were his hands on your back?

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,930
<1-12,RACH>不  开始时他的手搂着我的腰
<1-12,RACH>No, actually, first they started out on my waist...

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,750
<1-12,RACH>然后往上滑  最后摸到了我的头发
<1-12,RACH>and then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,670
<2-1,ROSS>然后
<2-1,ROSS>And...

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,530
<2-1,ROSS>然后我吻了她

<3-2,PHOE>你要用它来干什么
<3-2,PHOE>What will you use it for?

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,200
<3-3,CHAN>玩游戏之类的
<3-3,CHAN>Games and stuff.

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,290
<3-4,MNCA>根本没有工作  没有适合我的工作
<3-4,MNCA>There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
<3-5,JOEY>等一下  这边有一个
<3-5,JOEY>Oh, wait, here's one.

45
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,710
<3-5,JOEY>你愿意裸体做菜吗
<3-5,JOEY>Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?

46
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,480
<3-6,MNCA>有招聘裸体厨师的广告
<3-6,MNCA>There's an ad for a naked chef?

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,220
<3-7,JOEY>没  但你如果肯裸体做菜  那或许会愿意裸体跳舞
<3-7,JOEY>No, but if you'll cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked.

48
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,660
<3-8,ROSS>然后...
<3-8,ROSS>And then....

49
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,990
<3-9,PHOE>昨晚亲热得怎么样了
<3-9,PHOE>So how'd you make out last night?

50
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,380
<3-10,ROSS>真搞笑  让人痛苦的搞笑
<3-10,ROSS>That is funny. That is painfully funny.

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,790
<3-10,ROSS>不  等等
<3-10,ROSS>No, wait, wait.

<3-10,ROSS>对  只是痛苦而已
<3-10,ROSS>Yeah, that's just painful.

53
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,420
<3-11,MNCA>等等  我还以为昨天晚上很棒
<3-11,MNCA>Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.

54
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,810
<3-12,ROSS>没错  是很棒  但是当我回到家
<3-12,ROSS>Yeah, it was. But I get home...

55
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,370
<3-12,ROSS>我看到朱莉已经把盐水放在我的床头柜上
<3-12,ROSS>...and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table...

56
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,680
<3-12,ROSS>我就想"老天啊  我到底在做什么"
<3-12,ROSS>...and I think, "My God! What am I doing?"

57
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,100
<3-12,ROSS>我跟朱莉这么好的女人在一起
<3-12,ROSS>Here I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman...

58
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,310
<3-12,ROSS>我们互相关怀
<3-12,ROSS>...who I care about and who cares about me...

59
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,920
<3-12,ROSS>而我就那样抛弃一切吗
<3-12,ROSS>...and I'm just throwing all that away?

60
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,750
<3-13,JOEY>一杯盐水激发了你那么多感慨
<3-13,JOEY>You got all that from saline solution?

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,400
<3-14,MNCA>我们现在是在谈瑞秋  你跟瑞秋
<3-14,MNCA>We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,820
<3-15,ROSS>我大概有十年时间都在想跟瑞秋的事
<3-15,ROSS>Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for like ten years now.

63
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,710
<3-15,ROSS>但现在我跟朱莉在一起
<3-15,ROSS>But now I'm with Julie.

64
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,670
<3-15,ROSS>就好像我跟朱莉  我跟瑞秋
<3-15,ROSS>So it's like, me and Julie, me and Rachel.

<3-30,PHOE>你们好  好
<3-30,PHOE>Hello. Hi. Okay.

81
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,550
<3-23,ROSS>那...
<3-23,ROSS>So...

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,580
<3-30,PHOE>这是一首我乱编的
<3-30,PHOE>This is a song about a love triangle...

83
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,820
<3-30,PHOE>讲述三角恋的歌
<3-30,PHOE>... between three people that I made up.

84
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,410
<3-30,PHOE>叫做"昨晚其中两个接吻了"
<3-30,PHOE>It's called "Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

85
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,140
<3-31,PHOE>有个女孩  我们叫她贝蒂
<3-31,PHOE>There was a girl We'll call her Betty

86
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,890
<3-31,PHOE>有个男孩  咱们叫他尼尔
<3-31,PHOE>And a guy Let's call him Neil

87
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,190
<3-31,PHOE>我再三强调这一点
<3-31,PHOE>Now I can't stress this point too strongly

88
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,620
<3-31,PHOE>这故事不是真的
<3-31,PHOE>This story isn't real

89
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,940
<3-31,PHOE>现在尼尔必须决定  如何取舍
<3-31,PHOE>Now our Neil must decide Who will be the girl that he casts aside

90
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,520
<3-31,PHOE>是那个他真心相爱的贝蒂
<3-31,PHOE>Will Betty be the one who he loves truly

91
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,950
<3-31,PHOE>还是我们称为露莉的女孩
<3-31,PHOE>Or will it be the one who we'll call Loolie

92
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,850
<3-31,PHOE>他必须决定  他必须决定
<3-31,PHOE>He must decide He must decide

93
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,900
<3-31,PHOE>虽然他纯属虚构  他必须决定
<3-31,PHOE>Even though I made him up He must decide

94
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,490
<4-1,RTST>你的简历很漂亮
<4-1,RTST>Well, this is a nice resume.

96
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,080
<4-1,RTST>非常不错
<4-1,RTST>Muy impressivo.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,900
<4-2,MNCA>拉斯塔特先生  这份工作具体干什么  广告很含糊
<4-2,MNCA>Mr. Rastatter, what does this job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

98
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,930
<4-2,MNCA>麻克力
<4-2,MNCA>Macholate.

99
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,490
<4-4,MNCA>-什么  -麻克力
<4-4,MNCA>- I'm sorry? - Macholate.

100
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,920
<4-5,RTST>一种完全人工的巧克力替代品
<4-5,RTST>It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,490
<4-7,RTST>别客气  试一块
<4-7,RTST>Go ahead, try a piece.

102
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,100
<4-7,RTST>对  我们认为麻克力比巧克力更好吃
<4-7,RTST>Yeah. We think Macholate is even better than chocolate.

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,290
<4-9,RTST>好
<4-9,RTST>All right.

104
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,740
<4-10,MNCA>很有嚼劲
<4-10,MNCA>I love how it crumbles.

105
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,540
<4-10,MNCA>-巧克力就没这嚼劲  -是的  小姐
<4-10,MNCA>- You see, chocolate doesn't do that. - No, ma'am.

106
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,410
<4-11,RTST>反正呢  我们"很快"会通过食品药物管理局的检验
<4-11,RTST>Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our FDA approval any day now.

107
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,760
<4-11,RTST>希望能够赶得上感恩节
<4-11,RTST>Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

108
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,650
<4-11,RTST>照我们看来呢
<4-11,RTST>See, the way we look at it,

109
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,100
<4-11,RTST>巧克力已经占据了大多需要准备食物的节日
<4-11,RTST>chocolate dominates your major food-preparation holidays.

110
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,070
<4-11,RTST>复活节  圣诞节  等等
<4-11,RTST>Easter, Christmas, what have you.

111
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,860
<4-13,RTST>可我们在想  只要行销搞好了
<4-13,RTST>But, we're thinking, given the right marketing,

112
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,970
<4-13,RTST>我们就能让感恩节成为麻克力节
<4-13,RTST>...we can make Thanksgiving the Macholate holiday.

113
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,350
<4-15,RTST>你不吞下去吗
<4-15,RTST>Aren't you gonna swallow that?

114
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,410
<4-16,MNCA>我在等它不冒泡了
<4-16,MNCA>Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

115
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,330
<4-17,RTST>是不是很棒
<4-17,RTST>Isn't that great?

116
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,050
<8-12,ROSS>总之
<8-12,ROSS>Well, anyhow...

117
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,880
<4-18,MNCA>我们在找些厨师来弄新的感恩节食谱
<4-18,MNCA>...we're looking for chefs who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

118
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,990
<4-19,RTST>你有兴趣吗
<4-19,RTST>You think you might be interested?

119
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,110
<4-20,MNCA>绝对

<4-20,MNCA>I love creating recipes, I love Thanksgiving, and now...

122
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,340
<4-20,MNCA>我爱麻克力
<4-20,MNCA>... I love Macholate.

123
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,360
<4-21,RTST>真的
<4-21,RTST>Really?

124
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,590
<4-22,MNCA>特别是那种余味  简直...
<4-22,MNCA>Especially that aftertaste. I tell you...

125
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,180
<4-22,MNCA>可以保留到圣诞节
<4-22,MNCA>...that'll last you till Christmas.

126
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,700
<5-1,MNCA>麻克力慕斯怎么样
<5-1,MNCA>How about Macholate mousse?

127
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,470
<5-2,PHOE>没什么
<5-2,PHOE>It's not...

128
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,590
<5-2,PHOE>感恩节的味道
<5-2,PHOE>it's not very Thanksgiving-y.

129
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,890
<5-3,MNCA>那感恩节清教徒慕斯呢
<5-3,MNCA>How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

130
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,630
<5-4,PHOE>哪里像清教徒
<5-4,PHOE>What makes it Pilgrim?

131
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,280
<5-5,MNCA>放点搭扣上去
<5-5,MNCA>We'll put buckles on it.

133
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,400
<5-7,PHOE>罗斯来电话没
<5-7,PHOE>Did Ross call?

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,670
<5-9,RACH>很遗憾  没有
<5-9,RACH>No, I'm sorry.

135
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,320
<5-11,RACH>他为什么没打来
<5-11,RACH>Why didn't he call?

136
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,790
<5-11,RACH>他要跟朱莉在一起  是不是
<5-11,RACH>He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?

137
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,330
<5-11,RACH>他要跟她在一起  然后她会这样
<5-11,RACH>He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all,

138
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,720
<5-11,RACH>"我是朱莉  罗斯选我"
<5-11,RACH>"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

139
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,380
<5-11,RACH>"我们要结婚  生一堆孩子  然后全家一起挖骨头"
<5-11,RACH>We'll get married and have lots of kids and dig up stuff together!"

140
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,360
<5-12,PHOE>恕我冒犯  这不是她的风格
<5-12,PHOE>No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.

141
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:33,270
<6-1,ROSS>我不知道该怎么办  这简直是一场恶梦
<6-1,ROSS>I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? This is like a complete nightmare!

142
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,080
<6-2,CHAN>我知道  一定很难受  "糟糕  两个女人都爱我"
<6-2,CHAN>I know. This must be so hard. "Oh, no! Two women love me!

143
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,710
<6-2,CHAN>两个都是性感尤物
<6-2,CHAN>They're both gorgeous and sexy.

144
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,600
<6-2,CHAN>我的钱太多  皮包装不下
<6-2,CHAN>My wallet's too small for my fifties,

145
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,130
<6-2,CHAN>我的钻石鞋太紧了
<6-2,CHAN>...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

146
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,140
<6-4,CHAN>-我有个办法  罗斯  -别碰我的电脑
<6-4,CHAN>- Here's a thought, Ross.  - Don't touch the computer.

147
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,310
<6-4,CHAN>永远都别碰
<6-4,CHAN>Don't ever touch the computer.

148
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,670
<6-5,JOEY>罗斯  听着  我送你五个字
<6-5,JOEY>Ross, listen. I got two words for you:

149
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,420
<6-5,JOEY>三人行
<6-5,JOEY>Threesome.

150
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,430
<6-6,CHAN>我们用理性来分析  好吗  我们来列个单子
<6-6,CHAN>Let's get logical about this. We'll make a list.

151
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,000
<6-6,CHAN>"瑞秋和朱莉  优缺点"
<6-6,CHAN>"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,350
<6-6,CHAN>名字用不同字体加粗
<6-6,CHAN>We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts,

153
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,430
<6-6,CHAN>然后每一栏可以用不同的颜色
<6-6,CHAN>...and I can use different colors for each column.

154
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,300
<6-7,ROSS>用笔写不行吗
<6-7,ROSS>Can't we use a pen?

155
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,700
<6-8,CHAN>不行  原始人
<6-8,CHAN>No, Amish boy.

156
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,430
<6-9,JOEY>我们就先从缺点开始  那比较好玩
<6-9,JOEY>Let's start with the cons because they're more fun.

157
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,050
<6-9,JOEY>先列瑞秋
<6-9,JOEY>Rachel first.

158
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,940
<6-9,JOEY>我不知道
<6-9,JOEY>I don't know.

159
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,400
<6-10,ROSS>我是说
<6-10,ROSS>I mean....

160
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,490
<6-10,ROSS>好吧  可以说她有时有点娇生惯养
<6-10,ROSS>All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

161
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,250
<6-11,JOEY>可以这么说
<6-11,JOEY>You could say that.

162
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,930
<6-12,ROSS>有时候她有点像傻大姐
<6-12,ROSS>I guess, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?

163
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,850
<6-12,ROSS>我觉得她有点太注重她的外表
<6-12,ROSS>And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.

164
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,850
<6-12,ROSS>朱莉跟我有很多共同点
<6-12,ROSS>And Julie and I have a lot in common...

165
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,610
<6-12,ROSS>因为我们都是古生物学家
<6-12,ROSS>... because we're both paleontologists, right?

166
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,500
<6-12,ROSS>但是瑞秋她只是个女招待
<6-12,ROSS>But Rachel's just a waitress.

167
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,180
<6-13,CHAN>女招待
<6-13,CHAN>Waitress.

168
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,020
<6-13,CHAN>好了  你们要玩《毁灭战士》吗
<6-13,CHAN>Got it. You guys want to play Doom?

169
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,000
<6-13,CHAN>我们也可以继续
<6-13,CHAN>Or we could keep doing this.

170
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,300
<6-13,CHAN>还有呢
<6-13,CHAN>What else?

171
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,360
<6-14,ROSS>我不知道
<6-14,ROSS>I don't know.

172
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,030
<6-15,JOEY>她的脚踝有点胖
<6-15,JOEY>Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

173
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,730
<6-16,CHAN>好  换朱莉了
<6-16,CHAN>Okay, let's do Julie.

174
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,870
<6-16,CHAN>她有什么不好的
<6-16,CHAN>What's wrong with her?

175
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,910
<6-17,ROSS>她不是瑞秋
<6-17,ROSS>She's not Rachel.

176
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,960
<7-1,MNCA>这是麻克力饼屑陷南瓜派
<7-1,MNCA>This is pumpkin pie with a Macholate cookie crumb crust.

177
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,670
<7-1,MNCA>这个是麻克力红莓蛋糕  这些是麻克力碎屑饼干
<7-1,MNCA>This is Macholate cranberry cake, and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

178
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,350
<7-1,MNCA>跟印第安人的一样
<7-1,MNCA>Just like the lndians served.

179
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,690
<7-2,RACH>天啊
<7-2,RACH>Oh, my God!

180
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,920
<7-3,MNCA>太好吃了吗
<7-3,MNCA>"Oh, my God" good?

181
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,640
<7-4,RACH>天啊  我不敢相信你给我吃这个
<7-4,RACH>Oh, my God! I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.

182
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,430
<7-5,PHOE>我的天啊  这一定是万恶之味
<7-5,PHOE>Sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!

183
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,970
<7-5,PHOE>我说这个机器打印不出来
<7-5,PHOE>I'm telling you this thing won't print.

184
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,580
<7-5,PHOE>对  那个按钮我按了一百次了
<7-5,PHOE>Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times.

185
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,020
<8-1,CHAN>对热线而言  你没有那么热
<8-1,CHAN>For a hotline, you're not so hot.

186
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,930
<8-1,CHAN>背景声是什么
<8-1,CHAN>What is that in the background?

187
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,140
<8-1,CHAN>你在看《星际迷航》吗
<8-1,CHAN>Are you watching Star Trek?

188
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,820
<8-2,JOEY>你怎么跟朱莉说的  伤她心了吗
<8-2,JOEY>Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?

189
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,760
<8-3,ROSS>是啊  好可怕  她哭我也哭
<8-3,ROSS>Yes, it was horrible.  She cried, I cried.

190
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,490
<8-3,ROSS>她丢东西打到了我
<8-3,ROSS>She threw things, they hit me.

191
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,820
<8-3,ROSS>我这么做是对的
<8-3,ROSS>I did the right thing.

192
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,640
<8-4,CHAN>史巴克真的拥抱了他爸爸吗
<8-4,CHAN>So Spock actually hugs his father?

193
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,830
<8-5,RACH>你们有没有...
<8-5,RACH>Hey, do you guys have...

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,850
<8-10,ROSS>不是你想的那样
<8-10,ROSS>It's not what you think.

199
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,690
<8-10,ROSS>是别的事
<8-10,ROSS>It's the other thing.

200
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,280
<8-11,RACH>什么是别的事  我怎么想的
<8-11,RACH>Well, what's the other thing? What do I think?

201

<8-13,JOEY>他跟朱莉分手了
<8-13,JOEY>He broke up with Julie!

248
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,270
<8-41,RACH>"有点像傻大姐"
<8-41,RACH>"Kind of ditzy"?

249
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,590
<8-41,RACH>"太注重外表"
<8-41,RACH>"Too into her looks"?

250
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,060
<8-41,RACH>"娇生惯养"
<8-41,RACH>"Spoiled"?

251
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,080
<8-42,ROSS>是有点娇生惯养  他应该加上"有点"才对
<8-42,ROSS>Now that's a little spoiled.  He was supposed to type "little," the idiot!

252
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,570
<8-43,RACH>"只是个女招待"
<8-43,RACH>"Just a waitress"?

253
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,670
<8-44,ROSS>那是...
<8-44,ROSS>Now that was....

254
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,140
<8-44,ROSS>我是说  相对于...
<8-44,ROSS>I mean, as opposed to....

255
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,650
<8-44,ROSS>你念完了没有  瑞秋
<8-44,ROSS>Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

256
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,360
<8-45,RACH>我的脚踝一点都不胖
<8-45,RACH>I do not have chubby ankles!

257
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,650
<8-45,RACH>不  瑞秋
<8-45,RACH>No! I

258
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,800
<8-46,ROSS>好  你看另一边  你看看朱莉那一栏
<8-46,ROSS>Okay, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.

259
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,870
<8-46,ROSS>"她不是瑞琪"
<8-46,ROSS>"She's not Rachem"?

260
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,300
<8-47,RACH>瑞琪是什么东西啊
<8-47,RACH>What the hell's a Rachem?

261
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,110
<8-47,RACH>那是什么因为我是女招待
<8-47,RACH>Is that a stupid paleontology word I wouldn't know,

262
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,530
<8-47,RACH>而不懂的愚蠢古生物学用语吗
<8-47,RACH>because I'm just a waitress?

263
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,850
<9-1,ROSS>不  瑞秋  别这样
<9-1,ROSS>No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no!

264
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,000
<9-1,ROSS>是"她不是瑞秋"
<9-1,ROSS>It's "She's not Rachel"!

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,520
<9-1,ROSS>她不是...
<9-1,ROSS>She's not....

266
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,640
<9-1,ROSS>瑞秋
<9-1,ROSS>Ra--Rachel?

267
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,050
<10-1,CHAN>我的日记  太聪明了
<10-1,CHAN>My diary! My diary, that's brilliant.

268
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,060
<10-1,CHAN>我应该说那是我的日记  她绝不会逼我念我的日记
<10-1,CHAN>If I'd said it was my diary, she wouldn't have made me read my diary.

269
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,410
<10-2,MNCA>那倒是真的  你很适合在出事的第二天放马后炮
<10-2,MNCA>That's true. You'd be a great person to have around after an emergency.

270
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,240
<10-3,PHOE>真不敢相信罗斯列了单子
<10-3,PHOE>I cannot believe Ross even made this list.

271
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,980
<10-3,PHOE>-我知道  -简直浑蛋
<10-3,PHOE>- I know. - What a dinkus!

272
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,890
<10-4,JOEY>放他一马吧  那是钱德勒的主意
<10-4,JOEY>Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.

273
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,290
<10-6,MNCA>什么
<10-6,MNCA>What?

274
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,240
<10-7,CHAN>很好  我正希望你提呢
<10-7,CHAN>Oh, good. I was hoping that would come up.

275
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,130
<10-8,MNCA>这是你的主意
<10-8,MNCA>This was your idea?

276
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,620
<10-10,CHAN>拜托  你们想一下  事出必有因
<10-10,CHAN>Let's get some perspective here. These things happen for a reason.

277
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,940
<10-11,MNCA>对  就是你
<10-11,MNCA>Yeah. You!

278
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,040
<10-12,CHAN>菲比  帮我一下好吗  你相信因果报应那套狗屁吧
<10-12,CHAN>Pheebs, back me up,OK? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

279
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,960
<10-13,PHOE>对  祝你下辈子当大便虫好运
<10-13,PHOE>By the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.

280
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,710
<11-1,ROSS>瑞秋
<11-1,ROSS>Rach!

281
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,420
<11-1,ROSS>瑞秋
<11-1,ROSS>Rach!

282
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,350
<11-1,ROSS>开门好吗
<11-1,ROSS>Hey! Open up! Please?

283
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,190
<11-2,RACH>当别人不开门让你进来的时候  那表示"走开"
<11-2,RACH>When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means, "Go away."

284
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,980
<11-2,RACH>那并不表示请你爬防火梯上来
<11-2,RACH>It doesn't mean, "Climb up the fire escape."

285
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,120
<11-3,ROSS>我只想念一点你的优点给你听
<11-3,ROSS>I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.

286
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,780
<11-4,RACH>我不感兴趣
<11-4,RACH>Not interested.

287
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,010
<11-5,ROSS>第一  你看游戏节目时哭的样子
<11-5,ROSS>"Number one: the way you cry at game shows.

288
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,440
<11-5,ROSS>第二  你对朋友的感情
<11-5,ROSS>Number two: how much you love your friends.

289
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,580
<11-5,ROSS>第三  你紧张时玩头发的样子
<11-5,ROSS>Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous.

290
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,750
<11-5,ROSS>第四  重新开始新生活的勇敢
<11-5,ROSS>Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over.

291
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,130
<11-5,ROSS>第五  你很会逗小本
<11-5,ROSS>Number five: how great you are with Ben.

292
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,810
<11-6,ROSS>第六  你的香味
<11-6,ROSS>Number six: the way you smell."

293
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,700
<11-7,JOEY>罗斯  你在干什么
<11-7,JOEY>Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?

294
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,740
<11-8,ROSS>乔伊  帮我开窗好不好
<11-8,ROSS>Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?

295
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,670
<11-9,JOEY>好呀  来
<11-9,JOEY>Oh, yeah.

296
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,100
<11-10,CHAN>-你在外面干什么 -我...
<11-10,CHAN>- What are you doing out there? - I'm....

297
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,400
<11-11,ROSS>天啊  你一定冻坏了  知道你需要什么吗
<11-11,ROSS>You must be freezing. You know what you need?

298
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,090
<11-12,MNCA>来杯热腾腾的麻克力怎么样
<11-12,MNCA>How about a nice, steaming cup of hot Macholate?

299
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,270
<11-13,ROSS>阿秋  快开门
<11-13,ROSS>Rach, come on, open up.

300
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,570
<11-13,ROSS>阿秋  别这样  你再给我一次机会
<11-13,ROSS>Rach, come on, come on,. You gotta give me another chance.

301
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,740
<11-14,RACH>不
<11-14,RACH>No.

302
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,560
<11-16,RACH>-不  -不就是不
<11-16,RACH>- No? - That's what I said.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,190
<11-17,CHAN>也许我们该回避
<11-17,CHAN>Maybe we should go.

304
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,630
<11-18,RACH>不  你们真的不用走  我们已经谈完了
<11-18,RACH>No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.

305
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,470
<11-19,ROSS>拜托  我知道你一定...
<11-19,ROSS>Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.

306
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,300
<11-19,ROSS>不  你不  罗斯
<11-19,ROSS>No! You don't, Ross.

307
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,480
<11-20,RACH>想像一下  你觉得自己最大的缺陷
<11-20,RACH>Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.

308
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:46,140
<11-20,RACH>如果这个世界上  你最信任的人
<11-20,RACH>Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world

309
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,000
<11-20,RACH>不止也看成是缺陷
<11-20,RACH>... not only thinks them too...

310
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,420
<11-20,RACH>还用来当做不跟你在一起的理由  换了你会怎么样
<11-20,RACH>... but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.

311
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,000
<11-21,ROSS>就算是那样  我还是想要跟你在一起
<11-21,ROSS>No, but see, I want to be with you in spite of all those things.

312
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,380
<11-22,RACH>你真是宽宏大量  罗斯
<11-22,RACH>Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.

313
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,700
<11-22,RACH>我说了  别走
<11-22,RACH>I said, don't go!

314
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,060
<11-23,ROSS>你知道吗
<11-23,ROSS>You know what?

315
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,840
<11-23,ROSS>如果今天是你列单子
<11-23,ROSS>If it were the other way around, there is nothing you could put on a list...

316
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,670
<11-23,ROSS>不管你在单子上写什么  都阻止不了我跟你在一起
<11-23,ROSS>that would ever make me not want to be with you.

317
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,090
<11-24,RACH>我想这就是我们的不同之处
<11-24,RACH>Well, then I guess that's the difference between us.

318
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,570
<11-24,RACH>我绝对不会去列单子
<11-24,RACH>See, I'd never make a list.

319
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,650
<11-25,JOEY>每次遇上这种情况  我都不知道要等多久才能开口
<11-25,JOEY>I never know how long to wait in this situation before you can talk again.

320
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,810
<11-25,JOEY>我再等一会儿好了
<11-25,JOEY>Maybe a little longer.

321
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,420
<12-1,MNCA>我其中的一些食谱用的麻克力份量或许有点不寻常
<12-1,MNCA>Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual,

322
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,850
<12-1,MNCA>像这个椰子麻克力干果棒
<12-1,MNCA>Like these coconut Macholate holiday nut bars?

323
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,960
<12-1,MNCA>我上面写了四杯椰子  四杯碎干果
<12-1,MNCA>I've indicated four cups of coconut and four cups of crushed nut,

324
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,820
<12-1,MNCA>而只有一大匙的麻克力
<12-1,MNCA>...and only one tablespoon of Macholate.

325
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,470
<12-2,RTST>-不重要了  -什么
<12-2,RTST>- Doesn't matter. - What?

326
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,190
<12-4,RTST>食品药物管理局没有通过
<12-4,RTST>Our FDA approval didn't come through.

327
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,170
<12-4,RTST>实验室老鼠的问题吧
<12-4,RTST>Something about laboratory rats.

328
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,370
<12-5,MNCA>天啊  真遗撼
<12-5,MNCA>Gosh, I'm sorry.

329
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,610
<12-5,MNCA>是呀
<12-5,MNCA>Yeah.

330
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,460
<12-6,RTST>总之呢  这是给你的支票
<12-6,RTST>Anyhow, here's your check.

331
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,680
<12-6,RTST>谢谢你出了这么多力
<12-6,RTST>Thank you for all the trouble you went through.

332
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,640
<12-6,RTST>你做的时候没有吃很多吧
<12-6,RTST>Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?

333
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,610
<12-7,MNCA>我吃了一些
<12-7,MNCA>Well, I ate some.

334
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,110
<12-8,RTST>一些  那还好  一些可以  一些不是很多
<12-8,RTST>Oh, some is fine. Some is not a lot.

335
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,840
<12-8,RTST>那你尿尿的时候  没有灼痛的感觉吧
<12-8,RTST>So it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?

336
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,720
<13-1,MNCA>喂
<13-1,MNCA>Hello?

337
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,710
<13-3,RACH>又是他吗
<13-3,RACH>Is that him again?

338
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,530
<13-3,RACH>告诉他我想去接电话  可是我脚踝太胖走不动
<13-3,RACH>Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighing me down.

339
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,030
<13-4,MNCA>听着  现在还不是时候
<13-4,MNCA>Listen. I don't think this is the best time.

340
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,970
<13-5,ROSS>帮我个忙好吗
<13-5,ROSS>Look, can you do something for me?

341
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,110
<13-6,MNCA>好  什么事
<13-6,MNCA>Sure. What?

342
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,340
<13-6,MNCA>好的
<13-6,MNCA>All right.

343
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,930
<13-6,MNCA>来点音乐
<13-6,MNCA>Music?

344
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,780
<13-6,MNCA>好
<13-6,MNCA>Sure.

345
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,670
<13-7,RADIO>下一首是罗斯要点给瑞秋的歌曲
<13-7,RADIO>The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross.

346
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,340
<13-7,RADIO>瑞秋  他要你知道  他为他的行为深感抱歉
<13-7,RADIO>Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did

347
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,510
<13-7,RADIO>希望你能从心底原谅他
<13-7,RADIO>and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.

349
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,840
<13-7,RADIO>*看到你眼若冰霜*
<13-7,RADIO>*See the stones set in your eyes*

350
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,000
<13-7,RADIO>*看到你浑身带刺*
<13-7,RADIO>*See the thorn twist in your side*

351
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,130
<13-7,RADIO>*我会等你*
<13-7,RADIO>*I'll wait for you*

352
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,200
<13-7,RADIO>*上天真爱作弄人*
<13-7,RADIO>*Sleight of hand and twist of fate*

353
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,040
<13-7,RADIO>*她就让我苦苦地等*
<13-7,RADIO>*On a bed of nails she makes me wait*

354
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,750
<13-7,RADIO>*不论你是否在身旁  我会等你*
<13-7,RADIO>*And I'll wait without you*

355
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,490
<14-1,RADIO>我们刚接到瑞秋的电话  她说了罗斯做的事
<14-1,RADIO>We've just gotten a call from Rachel and she told us what Ross did.

356
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,210
<14-1,RADIO>真令人发指  罗斯  如果你在听
<14-1,RADIO>It's pretty appalling. And, Ross, if you're listening...

357
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,210
<14-1,RADIO>我不想再放你点的歌了
<14-1,RADIO>...I don't want to play your song anymore.

358
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,710
<14-1,RADIO>我们何不将时间留给还有机会的情侣
