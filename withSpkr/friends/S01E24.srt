00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,710
<2-76,Joey>那本书帮我度过许多难关
<2-76,Joey>That book got me through some tough times.

133
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,400
<2-77,Melanie>这男人心里住着个小孩子
<2-77,Melanie>There's a little child inside this man.

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,450
<2-78,Chandler>医生说如果把小孩取出来  他就会死
<2-78,Chandler>The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.

135
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,850
<2-79,Rachel>-这是谁送的  -罗斯送的
<2-79,Rachel>- Who's this from? - That's Ross'.

136
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,380
<2-81,Rachel>天啊  他居然记得
<2-81,Rachel>Oh,my God! He remembered!

137
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,320
<2-82,Phoebe>-记得什么  -大约几个月前
<2-82,Phoebe>- Remembered what? - lt was like months ago.

138
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,760
<2-83,Rachel>我们经过一家古董店
<2-83,Rachel>We walked by this antique store.

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,050
<2-83,Rachel>我在橱窗里看见这个胸针
<2-83,Rachel>And I saw this pin in the window.

140
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,170
<2-83,Rachel>就跟他说我小时候祖母也有个一模一样的
<2-83,Rachel>And I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was a little girl.

141
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,820
<2-86,Monica>没想到他还记得
<2-86,Monica>I can't believe he remembered!

142
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,620
<2-84,Chandler>是挺感人  但你能在飞机上玩吗
<2-84,Chandler>Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?

143
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,440
<2-85,Phoebe>好漂亮  一定花了他不少钱
<2-85,Phoebe>It's so pretty! This must've cost him a fortune.

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,730
<2-86,Monica>真没想到他会这么做
<2-86,Monica>I can't believe he did this.

145
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,010
<2-87,Chandler>得了吧  罗斯  记得大学那会
<2-87,Chandler>Come on, Ross, remember back in collage,

146
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,230
<2-87,Chandler>他爱上卡罗尔时
<2-87,Chandler>when he fell in love with Carol...

147
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,360
<2-87,Chandler>送她一只贵死人的水晶鸭吗
<2-87,Chandler>...and bought her that expensive crystal duck?

148
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,550
<2-88,Rachel>你刚说什么
<2-88,Rachel>What did you just say?

149
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,960
<2-89,Chandler>水晶鸭
<2-89,Chandler>Crystal duck.

150
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,950
<2-89,Chandler>不不不
<2-89,Chandler>No, no, no.

151
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,030
<2-90,Rachel>是爱上那一段
<2-90,Rachel>The "love" part?

152
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,300
<2-92,Rachel>天啊
<2-92,Rachel>Oh, my God!

153
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,500
<2-93,Chandler>糟了  糟了  糟了
<2-93,Chandler>Oh, no, no, no.

154
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,330
<2-94,Joey>很好  继续揉你的头  时光会倒流的
<2-94,Joey>That's good. Just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.

155
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,960
<3-1,Rachel>太不可思议了  真是太不可思议了
<3-1,Rachel>This is unbelievable. I mean, this is unbelievable!

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
<3-2,Phoebe>我知道  这是件很大很大的事
<3-2,Phoebe>I know. This is really, really huge.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,810
<3-3,Chandler>不对  它就是件微小的  细小的  小事
<3-3,Chandler>No, it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

158
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,540
<3-4,Phoebe>我认为所有人的生活都将从此改变
<3-4,Phoebe>I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.

159
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,480
<3-5,Chandler>这女人身上有静音键吗
<3-5,Chandler>Is there a mute button on this woman?

160
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,470
<3-6,Monica>我认为这样很好啊  是你和罗斯哎
<3-6,Monica>I think this is so great. I mean, you and Ross!

161
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,980
<3-6,Monica>-你有预感吗  -没有  一点没有
<3-6,Monica>- Did you have any idea? - No, none!

162
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,570
<3-7,Rachel>我来到纽约的第一夜
<3-7,Rachel>I mean, my first night in the city,

163
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,390
<3-7,Rachel>他曾提过想约我出去
<3-7,Rachel>he mentioned something about asking me out,

164
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,750
<3-7,Rachel>但后来就没下文了所以我
<3-7,Rachel>but nothing ever happened so I just...

165
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,340
<3-7,Rachel>他还说过什么  他是想约我出去吗
<3-7,Rachel>What else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?

166
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,590
<3-8,Joey>考虑到他爱你爱得无法自拔
<3-8,Joey>Well, given that he's desperately in love with you,

167
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,650
<3-8,Joey>大概不会介意跟你喝杯咖啡什么的
<3-8,Joey>he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.

168
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,320
<3-9,Rachel>罗斯  这么久吗
<3-9,Rachel>Ross? All this time?

<3-12,Monica>Wati, his flight doesn't leave for 45 more minutes.

172
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,910
<3-13,Chandler>-时差呢  -从这儿到机场吗
<3-13,Chandler>- What about time difference? - From here to the airport?

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,960
<3-18,Chandler>-我不知道  -那你或许不该去
<3-18,Chandler>- I don't know. - Then maybe you shouldn't go.

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,750
<3-19,Joey>他说的没错  如果你是去伤他的心
<3-19,Joey>He's right. If you're gonna break his heart,

178
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,340
<3-19,Joey>那不妨再等等
<3-19,Joey>that the kind of thing that you can wait.

179
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,680
<3-20,Monica>对  但如果是好消息  你得立刻告诉他
<3-20,Monica>Yeah, but if it's the good news, you should tell him now.

180
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,970
<3-21,Rachel>我不知道  或许见到他我就想明白了
<3-21,Rachel>I don't know, maybe I'll know when I see him.

181
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,560

<6-10,Melanie>我说不好  大概是我把你划在
<6-10,Melanie>I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged

216
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,110
<6-10,Melanie>那些只顾自己享受的人那一类
<6-10,Melanie>as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.'

217
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,880
<6-10,Melanie>但你是个乐于付出的人

<6-10,Melanie>要我说  你简直就是个女人
<6-10,Melanie>I mean, you're practically a woman.

220
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,020
<7-1,Monica>那么  瑞秋  这包装纸要留下来吗
<7-1,Monica>Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper,

221
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,830
<7-1,Monica>稍微有点撕坏了
<7-1,Monica>I mean, it's only a little bit torn...

222
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,590
<7-1,Monica>你要为罗斯留下  还是要我丢掉
<7-1,Monica>Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out?

223
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,500
<7-1,Monica>我不知道  我不知道
<7-1,Monica>I don't know. I don't know.

224
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,540
<7-2,Rachel>我去的路上一直在思考
<7-2,Rachel>I thought about it all the way there,

225
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,530
<7-2,Rachel>回来还没想通  你懂的  那是罗斯啊
<7-2,Rachel>and I thought about it all the way back. You know, it's Ross!

226
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,150
<7-2,Rachel>你们知道我什么意思  那可是罗斯啊
<7-2,Rachel>You know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,680
<7-3,Monica and Phoebe>-当然  -当然
<7-3,Monica and Phoebe>- Sure! - Sure.

228
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,160
<7-4,Rachel>我说不清  也就是我的第一直觉
<7-4,Rachel>I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling...

229
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,250
<7-4,Rachel>我想这样应该会很不错
<7-4,Rachel>but I'm thinking it'd be really great.

230
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,520
<7-5,Monica>天啊  我也这么想  我们会是姑嫂兼闺蜜
<7-5,Monica>Oh, my God, me too! We'd be like friends-in-law!

231
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,510
<7-5,Monica>你知道最棒的是什么吗
<7-5,Monica>You know what the best part is?

232
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,650
<7-5,Monica>最棒的就是你已对他了如指掌
<7-5,Monica>The best part is you already know all about him.

233
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,920
<7-6,Phoebe>就好像你们直接开始第15次约会
<7-6,Phoebe>It's like you start on the 15th date.

234
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,790
<7-6,Phoebe>没错  但你想想  从第15次约会开始啊
<7-6,Phoebe>Yeah, but you know, it would be like starting on the 15th date.

235
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,460
<7-7,Monica>这话说的好
<7-7,Monica>Another good point.

236
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,840
<7-8,Phoebe>我是说  在第15次约会时  感情已经
<7-8,Phoebe>I mean, on the 15th date, you're already in a very...

237
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,510
<7-8,Phoebe>相当深厚  你们已经定下来了
<7-8,Phoebe>..."relationship-y" place. You're committed.

238
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,070
<7-10,Phoebe>如果感情破裂该怎么办
<7-10,Phoebe>What happens if it doesn't work out?

239
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,320
<7-11,Monica>-为何会感情破裂  -不知道  天意弄人
<7-11,Monica>- Why isn't it working out? - I don't know. Sometimes it doesn't.

240
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,290
<7-13,Monica>他长得不够帅吗  他钱赚得不够多吗
<7-13,Monica>Is he not cute enough for you? Does he not make enough money?

241
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,890
<7-16,Rachel>-不  我只是  -说不定有第三者
<7-16,Rachel>- No, I'm just... - Maybe there's someone else.

242
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,650
<7-18,Rachel>真的吗  你移情别恋了
<7-18,Rachel>Is there? ls there someone else?

243
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,390
<7-20,Rachel>没有  我没有变心
<7-20,Rachel>No, there is no one else.

244
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,710
<7-21,Monica>那么你为什么要甩掉我哥
<7-21,Monica>Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?

245
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,860
<8-1,Chandler>早啊  大慈善家
<8-1,Chandler>Hey, big Spender!

246
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,020
<8-4,Joey>她还在睡觉
<8-4,Joey>She's still asleep.

247
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,890
<8-5,Chandler>-情况如何  -棒极了
<8-5,Chandler>- So how'd it go? - Oh, it was amazing.

248
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,970
<8-6,Joey>你是不是老觉得自己床上功夫不错
<8-6,Joey>You know how you always think you're great in bed?

249
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,430
<8-7,Chandler>你会问这种问题
<8-7,Chandler>The fact that you'd even ask that question

250
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,220
<8-7,Chandler>表示你根本不了解我
<8-7,Chandler>shows how little you know me.

251
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,360
<8-8,Joey>昨晚我不能做通常让自己满足的事
<8-8,Joey>Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.

252
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,670
<8-8,Joey>因此我只好让她满足
<8-8,Joey>So I had to do all this other stuff.

253
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,870
<8-8,Joey>结果我得到什么回应  天啊
<8-8,Joey>And the response I got! Man,oh,man!

254
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,410
<8-8,Joey>就像抛彩带庆祝游行一样
<8-8,Joey>It was like a ticker-tape parade!

255
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,330
<8-9,Chandler>我明白  我房间离游行路线非常非常近
<8-9,Chandler>I know. My room's very,very close to the parade route.

256
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,570
<8-9,Chandler>这简直太神奇了
<8-9,Chandler>It was amazing,

257
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,340
<8-10,Joey>而且不只是对她  对我也一样
<8-10,Joey>and not just for her. For me too!

258
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,790
<8-10,Joey>就好像我突然失明
<8-10,Joey>It's like,all of a sudden I'm blind...

259
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,440
<8-10,Joey>但其他的感官却更加的敏感
<8-10,Joey>... but all my other senses are heightened.

260
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,810
<8-10,Joey>好像我的体会达到了
<8-10,Joey>It's like I was able to appreciate it...

261
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,170
<8-11,Chandler>更高的境界
<8-11,Chandler>...on another level.

262
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,030
<8-11,Chandler>真没想到你还有更高的境界.
<8-11,Chandler>I didn't know you had another level.

263
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,690
<8-12,Joey>是啊  我也没想到
<8-12,Joey>I know. Neither did l!

264
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,460
<9-1,Monica>-裙子好漂亮  生日礼物吗  -对
<9-1,Monica>- Hey, great skirt. Birthday present? -Yeah.

265
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,950
<9-3,Monica>-谁送的  -你
<9-3,Monica>- From who? - You.

266
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,910
<9-4,Rachel>我把你送的衬衫拿去换的
<9-4,Rachel>I exchanged the blouse you got me.

267
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,040
<9-5,Monica>好吧  心意到了
<9-5,Monica>Well, it's the thought.

268
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,950
<9-5,Monica>罗斯的航班不是再过几小时就要抵达
<9-5,Monica>Doesn't Ross' flight get in in a couple hours?

269
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,280
<9-5,Monica>27B通道吗
<9-5,Monica>At gate 27B?

270
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,800
<9-6,Rachel>对  莫妮卡  我一直在想
<9-6,Rachel>Yeah. Monica,you know, I've been thinking about it.

271
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,040
<9-6,Rachel>我觉得和罗斯在一起
<9-6,Rachel>I've decided this whole Ross thing,

272
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,460
<9-6,Rachel>实在不是明智之举
<9-6,Rachel>it's just not a good idea.

273
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,100
<9-7,Monica>为什么
<9-7,Monica>Why?

274
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,090
<9-8,Rachel>因为我感觉自己不仅是跟他约会
<9-8,Rachel>Because I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.

275
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,380
<9-8,Rachel>而是跟你们大家一起约会
<9-8,Rachel>I'd be going out with all of you.

276
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,820
<9-8,Rachel>这样压力实在太大  而我不想...
<9-8,Rachel>and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...

277
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,760
<9-9,Monica>不不不  别有压力  别有压力
<9-9,Monica>No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!

278
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,020
<9-10,Rachel>莫妮卡  什么都还没发生呢  你就...
<9-10,Rachel>Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...

279
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,050
<9-11,Monica>我没有怎样  开始我的确有点反应过度
<9-11,Monica>I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first...

280
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,180
<9-11,Monica>但我没事的  我保证
<9-11,Monica>... but I'll be good. I promise.

281
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,020
<9-13,Intercom>-是谁  -是我  卡尔
<9-13,Intercom>- Who is it? - It's me, Carl.

282
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,460
<9-14,Rachel>-上来   -背着我哥做这种事
<9-14,Rachel>- Come on up. - Behind my brother's back?

283
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,120
<9-15,Monica>我发誓绝不会跟你说这种疯话
<9-15,Monica>is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.

284
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,440
<10-1,Joey>-七百块  -行啊  你办到了
<10-1,Joey>- Seven hundred bucks! - All right,you did it!

285
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,390
<10-2,Chandler>我们有水果可吃吗
<10-2,Chandler>Do we have any fruit?

286
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,000
<10-3,Joey>兄弟  这两周真够折腾
<10-3,Joey>Man, hell of a two weeks.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,420
<10-3,Joey>你知道吗  我真觉得自己有所长进
<10-3,Joey>You know what? I really feel like I learned something.

288
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,040
<10-4,Chandler>真的吗  那你要坚持为她奉献吗
<10-4,Chandler>Really? You're gonna stick with this "all for her" thing?

289
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,780
<10-5,Joey>你疯了不成
<10-5,Joey>What are you, crazy?

290
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,010
<10-5,Joey>盲人重见光明后
<10-5,Joey>When a blind man gets his sight back,

291
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,180
<10-5,Joey>还会这样走路吗
<10-5,Joey>does he walk around like this?

292
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,660
<10-5,Joey>我是说  如果再让我看见艾德贝格拉二世
<10-5,Joey>I'm just saying, if I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr...

294
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,700
<11-1,Carl>在电车上的照片  我就举枪自尽
<11-1,Carl>...in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself!

295
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,030
<11-1,Carl>别误会我
<11-1,Carl>I mean, don't get me wrong...

296
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,410
<11-1,Carl>我个人并不反对环保本身
<11-1,Carl>I'm not against environmental issues, per se...

297
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,640
<11-1,Carl>只是讨厌那家伙
<11-1,Carl>...it's just that guy!

298
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
<11-2,Ross>我难以相信你跟他约会  而不是跟我
<11-2,Ross>I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.

299
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,460
<11-3,Rachel>抱歉  我正在约会
<11-3,Rachel>Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here.

300
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,020
<11-4,Ross>行  那就别再想我
<11-4,Ross>Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

301
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,230
<11-5,Ross>办不到  对不对
<11-5,Ross>Can't do it, can you?

302
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,860
<11-6,Rachel>我没法不想你  那又怎样
<11-6,Rachel>I'm thinking about you. So what?

303
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,700
<11-7,Ross>我想不通  你到底看上这家伙哪点了
<11-7,Ross>I don't get it. What do you see in this guy anyway??

304
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,010
<11-8,Rachel>他像是个好男人
<11-8,Rachel>Happens to be a very nice guy.

305
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,140
<11-9,Carl>算了吧  老兄  买台真正的车吧
<11-9,Carl>I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car!

306
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,510
<11-10,Ross>瑞秋  别这样  给我们一个机会吧
<11-10,Ross>Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

307
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,980
<11-11,Rachel>罗斯  太难了
<11-11,Rachel>Ross, it's too hard.

308
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,610
<11-12,Ross>为什么  因为其他人会感觉不舒服吗
<11-12,Ross>Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else?

309
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,390
<11-12,Ross>谁管他们  这是我们两人的事
<11-12,Ross>Who cares about them. This is about us.

310
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,860
<11-12,Ross>我从九年级开始就爱上你
<11-12,Ross>I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.

311
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,610
<11-13,Rachel>罗斯  你就像是我最好的朋友
<11-13,Rachel>Ross, You're like my best friend.

312
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,690
<11-15,Rachel>如果我们分手  我将失去你
<11-15,Rachel>If we broke up, and I lost you...

313
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,780
<11-16,Ross>你为何认为我们会分手
<11-16,Ross>What makes you think we're gonna break up?

314
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,290
<11-17,Rachel>曾和你在一起的人不是都和你分手了
<11-17,Rachel>Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?

315
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,280
<11-17,Rachel>的确
<11-17,Rachel>No.

316
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,690
<11-18,Ross>但这种事只会发生一次
<11-18,Ross>But it only has to happen once.

317
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,910
<11-18,Ross>你我都清楚  我们是天生一对
<11-18,Ross>You and I both know we are perfect for each other. Right?

318
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,980
<11-18,Ross>唯一的问题是  你对我有感觉吗
<11-18,Ross>So the only question is: Are you attracted to me?

319
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,950
<11-18,Ross>我不知道
<11-18,Ross>I don't know.

320
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,440
<11-19,Rachel>我从未把你当成过潜在的男友
<11-19,Rachel>I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.

321
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,580
<11-20,Ross>那就设想下吧
<11-20,Ross>Well, start looking.

322
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,550
<11-22,Carl>就是这意思
<11-22,Carl>Exactly!

323
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,510
<11-22,Carl>你很清楚我会是那个
<11-22,Carl>And you just know that I'm gonna be the guy...

324
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,280
<11-22,Carl>在路上被堵在怪物车后的家伙
<11-22,Carl>...caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!

325
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,890
<11-23,Rachel>对  你说的对
<11-23,Rachel>Right! You're right.

326
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,010
<11-24,Carl>-你知道吗  -怎么
<11-24,Carl>- You know what? - What?

327
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,590
<11-26,Carl>我忘了  我本应该去机场接朋友
<11-26,Carl>I forgot. I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.

328
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,990
<11-27,Rachel>真是抱歉
<11-27,Rachel>I am so sorry!

330
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,670
<11-27,Rachel>-但我得走了  抱歉  -可是
<11-27,Rachel>- I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry. - But....

<12-1,Rachel>Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

333

<13-1,Man>没有瑞秋这个人
<13-1,Man>There's no Rachel!
