<3-18,MONICA>书名是《掌握自己的风》
<3-18,MONICA>It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper.

66
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,740
<3-18,MONICA>讲的是女人需要拥有更多的权力
<3-18,MONICA>It's about how women need to become more empowered.

67
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,850
<3-19,PHOEBE>对  但是有  有风
<3-19,PHOEBE>Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind

68
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,010
<3-19,PHOEBE>风能够让我们变成女神
<3-19,PHOEBE>and the wind can make us Goddesses.

69
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,990
<3-19,PHOEBE>知道谁夺走我们的风吗
<3-19,PHOEBE>But you know who takes out wind?

70
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,530
<3-19,PHOEBE>男人  他们就那样夺走了
<3-19,PHOEBE>Men, they just take it.

71
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,470
<3-20,RACHEL>男人就这样夺走我们的风

<3-21,PHOEBE>Ya-huh, all the time,

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,390
<3-21,PHOEBE>因为他们是闪电使者
<3-21,PHOEBE>cause they are the lightning bearers.

74
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,630
<3-23,PHOEBE>听起来蛮酷的
<3-23,PHOEBE>Well that sounds kinda cool,

75
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,930
<3-24,RACHEL>有点像《哈比人历险记》
<3-24,RACHEL>kinda like The Hobbit.

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,660
<3-25,MONICA>跟《哈比人历险记》不沾边
<3-25,MONICA>It is nothing like The Hobbit.

77
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,250
<3-25,MONICA>就像在读我有过的每一段关系
<3-25,MONICA>It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had,

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,670
<3-25,MONICA>理查德除外
<3-25,MONICA>except for Richard.

79
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,010
<3-26,PHOEBE>理查德绝不会偷走你的风
<3-26,PHOEBE>Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,760
<3-27,MONICA>不会
<3-27,MONICA>No.

81
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,140
<3-28,PHOEBE>因为他很可口
<3-28,PHOEBE>No, 'cause he's yummy.

82
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,030
<3-29,MONICA>对  但是其他的都会
<3-29,MONICA>Yes. But all the other ones.

83
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,060
<3-30,PHOEBE>还有  他们总是吸走
<3-30,PHOEBE>Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like

84
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,160
<3-30,PHOEBE>我们储存的内在能量
<3-30,PHOEBE>drinking from out pool of inner power,

85
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,560
<3-30,PHOEBE>但我们连尝一口都不准
<3-30,PHOEBE>but God forbid we should take a sip.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,980
<3-31,JOEY>谁要吃根长条糕
<3-31,JOEY>Anybody want a croan.

87
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,050
<3-32,PHOEBE>这就是典型的闪电使者行为
<3-32,PHOEBE>Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing.

88
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,180
<3-32,PHOEBE>就是这样  就像是
<3-32,PHOEBE>Right there, it's like, um,

89
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,640
<3-32,PHOEBE>你好  谁要来一根我的老二形蛋糕
<3-32,PHOEBE>'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'

198
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,090
<7-3,EDDIE>只是在做一些脱水水果及蔬菜
<7-3,EDDIE>Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables.

203
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,130
<7-6,CHANDLER>大概是因为上一条是饼干公司做的吧
<7-6,CHANDLER>Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
