<1-11,Phoebe>I can't believe you did that.

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,430
<2-1,Monica>我为什么要喊"呜哇哦"啊
<2-1,Monica>Why did I whoo- hoo?

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,930
<2-1,Monica>难道我期望  他回过头来然后说
<2-1,Monica>Was I hoping he'd turn around and say...

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,300
<2-1,Monica>"我喜欢那声音  我现在就要你"
<2-1,Monica>..."I love that sound. I must have you now"?

<2-2,Phoebe>你好
<2-2,Phoebe>Hello.

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,530
<2-2,Phoebe>你好  昏迷的帅哥
<2-2,Phoebe>Hello, coma guy.

<2-3,Monica>菲比  你在干什么
<2-3,Monica>Phoebe, what are you doing?

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,010
<2-4,Phoebe>也许没人试过这个方法
<2-4,Phoebe>Maybe nobody's tried this.

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,150
<2-5,Monica>希望至少能知道他的名字
<2-5,Monica>I wish we at least knew his name.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,140
<2-5,Monica>瞧他这张脸
<2-5,Monica>Look at that face.

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,610
<2-5,Monica>即使他在昏迷中仍一副聪明样
<2-5,Monica>I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart.

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,660
<2-7,Monica>我猜他是个律师
<2-7,Monica>I doubt he is a lawyer.

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,730
<2-6,Phoebe>你看到他手指节上的茧子了吗
<2-6,Phoebe>Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckless?

44
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,120
<2-6,Phoebe>这意味着他是个艺术家
<2-6,Phoebe>That means he's artistic.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,760
<2-7,Monica>他是律师  但是兼职教雕塑
<2-7,Monica>Okay. He's a Lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,350
<2-7,Monica>而且他会跳舞
<2-7,Monica>And he can dance.

47
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,780
<2-8,Phoebe>他是那种静静听你讲话的人
<2-8,Phoebe>And he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening...

48
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,710
<2-8,Phoebe>而不会是那种嘴上说"我了解"
<2-8,Phoebe>... not saying, "I understand"...

49
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,770
<2-8,Phoebe>心里却猜想着你裸体的男人
<2-8,Phoebe>... but really wondering what you look like naked.

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,900
<2-9,Monica>我希望男生都像他这样
<2-9,Monica>I wish all guys could be like him.

<2-10,Phoebe>我知道
<2-10,Phoebe>I know.

52
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,280
<3-1,Chandler>城里难道没有适合你们的清醒男生吗
<3-1,Chandler>Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?

53
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,980
<3-2,Monica>他身旁没人照顾
<3-2,Monica>He doesn't have anyone.

54
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,530
<3-3,Phoebe>我们觉得应该负起责任
<3-3,Phoebe>Yeah, we-we feel kinda of responsible.

55
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,780
<3-4,Joey>我不敢相信你会喊出"呜哇哦"
<3-4,Joey>I can't believe you said"whoo-hoo."

56
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,730
<3-4,Joey>连我都不说"呜哇哦"
<3-4,Joey>I don't even say"whoo-hoo."

349
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,540
<13-27,Monica>男生都这样
<13-27,Monica>This is so typical.

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,260
<13-27,Monica>再付出
<13-27,Monica>...and we give.

352
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,600
<13-27,Monica>然后  我们得不到任何回报

353
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,400
<13-27,Monica>突然有一天
<13-27,Monica>And then one day, y'know,

354
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,450
<13-27,Monica>你醒了  然后说"那就再见吧"

357
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,150
<13-28,Phoebe>但我猜那因为你在昏迷的缘故
<13-28,Phoebe>But I guess it was just the coma.

358
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,270
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>车在楼下等着
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>Car's waiting downstairs,

359
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,420
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>我上来就是想
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>I just wanted to drop off

360
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,170
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>给你朋友送几本我的书
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>these copies of my book for your friends.

361
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,570
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>需要我在里斯本帮你买什么吗
<14-1,Mrs. Bing>Anything you want from Lisbon?

362
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,400
<14-2,Chandler>不需要  知道你去哪就够了
<14-2,Chandler>No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.

363
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,840
<14-3,Mrs. Bing>好吧  要乖哦  我爱你
<14-3,Mrs. Bing>Alright, well, be good, I love you.

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,980
<14-4,Chandler>你亲了我最好的罗斯
<14-4,Chandler>You kissed my best Ross.

365
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,410
<14-4,Chandler>好像说错了  反正差不多
<14-4,Chandler>Or something to that effect.

366
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,530
<14-5,Mrs. Bing>好吧
<14-5,Mrs. Bing>O-kay.

367
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,740
<14-5,Mrs. Bing>我做了蠢事
<14-5,Mrs. Bing>Look, it, it was stupid.

368
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,220
<14-6,Chandler>-愚蠢至极  -愚蠢至极
<14-6,Chandler>- Really stupid. - Really stupid.

369
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,530
<14-7,Mrs. Bing>我也不知道是怎么发生的
<14-7,Mrs. Bing>And I don't even know how it happened.

370
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,610
<14-7,Mrs. Bing>抱歉  孩子  我保证不会再发生这种事
<14-7,Mrs. Bing>I'm sorry, honey. I promise it will never happen again.

371
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,110
<14-7,Mrs. Bing>-你感觉好点吗  -是的
<14-7,Mrs. Bing>- Are we okay now? - Yeah.

372
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,670
<14-8,Chandler>不  不
<14-8,Chandler>No. No...

373
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,650
<15-1,Ross>男人与门之间禁忌的爱
<15-1,Ross>Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door..

374
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
<15-2,Joey>他做到了  他跟她说了
<15-2,Joey>He did it. He told her off,

375
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,670
<15-2,Joey>不只是亲吻的事  所有的事都说出来了
<15-2,Joey>and not just about the kiss, about everything.

376
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,280
<15-3,Ross>开什么玩笑
<15-3,Ross>You're kidding?

377
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,690
<15-4,Joey>他说你何时才能像个妈妈样子
<15-4,Joey>No, no. He said, "When are you gonna start being a mom?"

378
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,850
<15-6,Joey>她回答说
<15-6,Joey>Then she came back with:

379
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,480
<15-6,Joey>你何时才能成长起来
<15-6,Joey>"The question is,when are you gonna realize

380
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,370
<15-6,Joey>意识到我也很性感
<15-6,Joey>I have a bomb?"

381
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,140
<15-7,Ross>等等  你确定她不是说
<15-7,Ross>'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say

382
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,720
<15-7,Ross>你何时才能成长起来  意识到我是你妈
<15-7,Ross>"When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?"

383
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,820
<15-8,Joey>-这样比较合理  -你也这样认为
<15-8,Joey>- That makes more sense. - You think?

384
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,020
<15-9,Ross>现在情况怎么样
<15-9,Ross>So, what's going on now?

385
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,880
<15-10,Joey>我不知道  我一直在这儿说给你听
<15-10,Joey>I don't know. I've been standing here spelling it out for you.

386
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,450
<15-10,Joey>我什么都听不到  等等
<15-10,Joey>I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait.

387
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,870
<15-11,Ross>你看见什么了
<15-11,Ross>What do you see?

388
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,460
<15-12,Joey>很难说  他们好小  而且上下颠倒
<15-12,Joey>Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down.

389
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,900
<15-10,Joey>等等  等等
<15-10,Joey>Wait,wait,wait.

390
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,540
<15-12,Joey>他们走过来  他们走过去
<15-12,Joey>They're walking away. They're walking away.

391
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,640
<15-12,Joey>不  他们不走了
<15-12,Joey>No, no, they' re not.

392
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,110
<15-12,Joey>他们要过来了  快逃

<15-18,Mrs. Bing>- Mrs. Bing. - Mr. Geller.

397
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,600
<15-19,Chandler>你当真
<15-19,Chandler>You mean that?

398
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,410
<15-21,Chandler>对  有何不可
<15-21,Chandler>Yeah, why not?

399
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,860
<15-21,Chandler>我告诉她了

401
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,560
<15-23,Chandler>没有比这更糟糕的啦
<15-23,Chandler>Couldn't have gone worse.

<15-24,Ross>-感觉怎样  -不错
<15-24,Ross>- Well, how do you feel? - Pretty good.

<15-26,Ross>Well, see?

405
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,220
<15-26,Ross>或许我亲你妈不是个馊主意
<15-26,Ross>So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh?

406
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,140
<15-26,Ross>我们不必继续往下说了
<15-26,Ross>But.. we don't have to go down that road.

407
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,830
<16-1,Rachel>这只是第一章
<16-1,Rachel>Okay. Now this is just the first chapter...

<16-1,Rachel>他的手没伸向她茁壮的双峰
<16-1,Rachel>he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.

411
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
<16-2,Monica>什么是"耐头"
<16-2,Monica>What's a "niffle"?

412
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,160
<16-3,Joey>通常在"茁壮的双峰"上可以找到
<16-3,Joey>You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.

413
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,420
<16-4,Rachel>好吧  算我不会打字
<16-4,Rachel>Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist.

414
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,870
<16-5,Ross>等下  你们看到那段

416
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,670
<16-5,Ross>他那巨大颤抖的"笔"了吗
<16-5,Ross>his 'huge throbbing pens'?

417
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,720
<16-5,Ross>当他用那东西写字的时候
<16-5,Ross>Oh, yeah, you don't wanna be around

418
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,090
<16-5,Ross>你不会想在场的
<16-5,Ross>when he starts writing with those.

419
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,150
<16-6,Rachel>够了  还我
<16-6,Rachel>That's it. Give them back.
