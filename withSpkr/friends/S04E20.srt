28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,050
<2-5,Chandler>因为乔伊开始打鼾了
<2-5,Chandler>Because Joey started snoring!

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,400
<2-6,Monica>他睡在隔壁  有那么大声吗

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,960
<2-8,Chandler>你得去睡眠诊所瞧瞧了
<2-8,Chandler>You have to go to a sleep clinic!

<2-9,Joey>我说过  我才不要去什么诊所
<2-9,Joey>I told you, I'm not going to any clinic.

<2-9,Joey>我没有毛病  有毛病的是你
<2-9,Joey>I don't have a problem. You're the one with the problem.

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,520
<2-9,Joey>你该去"少任性别管我"诊所治治病
<2-9,Joey>You should go to a "Quit-being-a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,850
<2-10,Chandler>-根本就没有那种诊所  -当然有
<2-10,Chandler>- They don't have those. - Yeah, they do.

<2-12,Monica>每次我打鼾  他就把我翻过去
<2-12,Monica>and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over.

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,600
<2-13,Joey>爽哦
<2-13,Joey>Oh, yeah!

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,400
<2-14,Monica>他帮我翻身  我就不会打鼾了
<2-14,Monica>He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,990
<2-15,Chandler>下次你再打鼾  我就把你翻过去
<2-15,Chandler>Next time you snore, I'm rolling you over!

147
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,720
<7-1,Joey>真讨厌
<7-1,Joey>This sucks.

148
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,850
<7-1,Joey>我不知道去睡眠诊所
<7-1,Joey>I don't know I have to stay up all night

149
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,970
<7-1,Joey>前一晚还不能睡觉
<7-1,Joey>before I go to the stupid sleep clinic.

150
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,720
<7-1,Joey>我好累
<7-1,Joey>I'm so tired.

151
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,650
<7-1,Joey>现在才六点
<7-1,Joey>It's six o'clock.

152
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,380
<7-4,Rachel>听说你跟约书亚
<7-4,Rachel>I hear you and Joshua

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,880
<7-5,Chandler>要和罗斯跟艾蜜莉吃饭
<7-5,Chandler>are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily.

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,980
<7-5,Chandler>我觉得这么做很有风度
<7-5,Chandler>I think that's really cool.

155
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,550
<7-6,Joey>是啊  瑞秋  你处理得很好
<7-6,Joey>Yeah, Rach. I think you're handling that really well.

156
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,550
<7-7,Rachel>处理
<7-7,Rachel>"Handling it"?

157
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,030
<7-7,Rachel>什么处不处理  根本没什么好处理的
<7-7,Rachel>What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle.

158
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,320
<7-7,Rachel>如果没跟约书亚在一起
<7-7,Rachel>Maybe I'd have a problem with this

159
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,930
<7-7,Rachel>我或许会无法接受
<7-7,Rachel>if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

160
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,220
<7-7,Rachel>反正他们也结不成婚
<7-7,Rachel>They're not going to get married anyway.

161
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,580
<7-8,Chandler>什么
<7-8,Chandler>What?

162
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,380
<7-9,Rachel>他们搞这种闪电式订婚  简直可笑
<7-9,Rachel>Come on. They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!

163
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,590
<7-9,Rachel>他们订完婚要等一年左右再结婚吧
<7-9,Rachel>They'll be engaged for like what? A year?

164
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,090
<7-9,Rachel>在这段时间里
<7-9,Rachel>And somewhere along the way,

165
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,870
<7-9,Rachel>他们总会有人察觉到不对头
<7-9,Rachel>one of them is gonna realise what they've done

166
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,190
<7-9,Rachel>然后取消婚约
<7-9,Rachel>and they're gonna call the whole thing off.

167
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,390
<7-9,Rachel>你们等不到在他们婚礼上跳舞
<7-9,Rachel>I'm telling you, you'll be dancing at my wedding

168
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,640
<7-10,Chandler>就会先参加我的婚礼
<7-10,Chandler>before you dance at theirs.

169
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,620
<7-10,Chandler>我参加婚礼从不跳舞
<7-10,Chandler>You know, I don't dance at weddings.

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,820
<7-11,Rachel>为什么
<7-11,Rachel>Why not?

171
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,480
<7-12,Chandler>因为婚礼是结识异性的好地方
<7-12,Chandler>Because weddings are a great place to meet women.

172
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,730
<7-12,Chandler>而我跳舞是这副德性
<7-12,Chandler>When I dance, I look like this.

173
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,080
<7-13,Ross>你好
<7-13,Ross>Hey, man.

174
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,090
<7-15,Ross>4周后的今天你们有事吗
<7-15,Ross>What are you guys doing four weeks from today?

<7-18,Joey>free.

178
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,250
<7-19,Ross>太好了  我和艾蜜莉一个月后要结婚
<7-19,Ross>Great. Because Emily and I are getting married in a month.

179
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,120
<7-21,Ross>-什么  -没错
<7-21,Ross>- What? - Yep.

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,680
<7-22,Rachel>-一个月后  -对
<7-22,Rachel>- In a month? - Yeah.

181
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,840
<7-24,Rachel>-你是说30天后  -对
<7-24,Rachel>- You mean 30 days? - Yeah.

182
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,880
<7-26,Rachel>-从今天算起  -对
<7-26,Rachel>- From now? - Yeah.

183
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,260
<7-27,Ross>太棒了
<7-27,Ross>That's great!

184
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,670
<7-29,Ross>她一直想跟她父母
<7-29,Ross>Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place

185
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,050
<7-29,Ross>在同一个地方结婚
<7-29,Ross>that her parents got married,

186
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,730
<7-29,Ross>但那里马上就要拆了  所以...
<7-29,Ross>but it's getting torn down, so...

187
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,470
<7-29,Ross>我知道这很疯狂
<7-29,Ross>I know it's crazy,

188
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,440
<7-29,Ross>但我们之间从头到尾都很疯狂
<7-29,Ross>but everything up till now has been so crazy

189
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
<7-29,Ross>就是感觉很对味
<7-29,Ross>and it just feels right.

190
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,270
<7-30,Joey>那是我经期的第二天
<7-30,Joey>Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!

191
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,150
<7-30,Joey>这不是我的
<7-30,Joey>This isn't mine.

<8-3,Joshua>Your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.

195
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,430
<8-4,Rachel>没事  我只是想见你
<8-4,Rachel>Nothing. I just wanted to see you.

<8-8,Rachel>I'm more than okay. I am really, really happy.

202
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,460
<8-8,Rachel>你想知道为什么吗

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,120
<8-10,Rachel>我觉得我们进展得特别顺利
<8-10,Rachel>I think we are so on the right track.

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,960
<8-10,Rachel>我们很般配  我们很来电
<8-10,Rachel>I think we are working. I think we are clicking.

<8-11,Joshua>-你懂吗  -当然懂
<8-11,Joshua>- You know? - Yeah, sure, sure.

208
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,250
<8-11,Joshua>我们很来电
<8-11,Joshua>We're clicking.

209
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,460
<8-12,Rachel>如果说有什么小缺撼
<8-12,Rachel>If there was just one little area where

210
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,490
<8-12,Rachel>我们需要加强的
<8-12,Rachel>I think we need to work on, I would think

211
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,580
<8-12,Rachel>应该就是我们不够疯狂
<8-12,Rachel>it's that we're just not crazy enough.

212
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,410
<8-13,Joshua>老实说  我不太同意
<8-13,Joshua>I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.

213
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,720
<8-13,Joshua>你说得对
<8-13,Joshua>You know, yeah, you're right.

214
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,410
<8-14,Rachel>我们相处得很开心  但是...
<8-14,Rachel>We have our fun. Yeah? But...

215
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,930
<8-16,Rachel>我是说要再疯狂一点  你懂吗
<8-16,Rachel>I mean, like crazy! You know?

216
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,450
<8-13,Joshua>好吧
<8-13,Joshua>Okay. All right.

217
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,100
<8-14,Rachel>这件事听起来会有点仓促
<8-14,Rachel>This is going to sound, you know, a little hasty.

218
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,590
<8-14,Rachel>但你听我说就行
<8-14,Rachel>But just go with me.

219
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,700
<8-14,Rachel>我们结婚吧
<8-14,Rachel>What if we got married?

220
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,570
<8-16,Rachel>-什么  -我知道  你会觉得...
<8-16,Rachel>- What? - Oh, I know. It's so totally like...

<8-16,Rachel>"Whoa, can we do this?" You know?

222
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,110
<8-16,Rachel>但感觉就是很对  你不觉得吗
<8-16,Rachel>But it just feels right. Don't you think it does?

223
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,300
<8-16,Rachel>感觉真的很对  你不...
<8-16,Rachel>I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?

230
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,640
<8-17,Joshua>所以我是想说...不要...
<8-17,Joshua>So I'm thinking: No...

<10-6,Phoebe>我才不要直接扔给你  太假了
<10-6,Phoebe>I won't throw it right to you. That's not real.

256
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,370
<10-8,Phoebe>你看我  穿成这样我还在乎假不假吗
<10-8,Phoebe>Look at me. My big concern is what's real?

257
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,560
<10-11,Monica>天啊
<10-11,Monica>Oh, my God!

258
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,650
<10-13,Monica>我们真的很可悲  对吧
<10-13,Monica>We're really sad, aren't we?

259
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,200
<10-14,Phoebe>没错
<10-14,Phoebe>Yeah, I think we are.

260
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,470
<10-15,Monica>这都不是我的婚纱
<10-15,Monica>This isn't even my dress.

261
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,440
<10-16,Phoebe>你起码不是去
<10-16,Phoebe>At least you didn't rent yours

262
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,080
<10-16,Phoebe>"还不晚婚纱店"租的
<10-16,Phoebe>from a store called "It's Not Too Late."

263
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,380
<10-17,Monica>-我要换掉了  -我也是
<10-17,Monica>- I'm changing out of this. - Me, too.

264
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,480
<10-17,Monica>半小时后再换
<10-17,Monica>In like half an hour?

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,470
<10-18,Phoebe>我也是
<10-18,Phoebe>Me, too.

266
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,470
<10-18,Phoebe>这次直接扔给我
<10-18,Phoebe>All right, now throw it straight this time.

267
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,430
<10-18,Phoebe>我要结婚了
<10-18,Phoebe>I'm getting married!

268
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,390
<11-1,Phoebe>我现在好讨厌普通衣服
<11-1,Phoebe>I hate my regular clothes now.

269
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,500
<11-1,Phoebe>低头一看就知道
<11-1,Phoebe>I look down and I know

270
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,720
<11-1,Phoebe>今天不是我人生最特别的日子
<11-1,Phoebe>this won't be the most special day of my life.

271
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,530
<11-2,Monica>一开始还感觉挺好玩的
<11-2,Monica>I mean, it was kind of fun for a while...

272
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,990
<11-2,Monica>不过  你不觉得有点蠢吗
<11-2,Monica>but didn't you start to feel kind of silly?

273
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,670
<11-3,Phoebe>是有点
<11-3,Phoebe>I guess.

274
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,200
<11-4,Phoebe>天啊
<11-4,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

275
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,720
<11-6,Phoebe>你太不厚道了
<11-6,Phoebe>You're such a cheater!

276
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,690
<11-7,Chandler>小可爱们
<11-7,Chandler>Hello, little ones.

277
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,500
<11-10,Monica>-乔伊打鼾的毛病能治好吗   -能
<11-10,Monica>- So, is Joey going to stop snoring? - Yep!

278
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,620
<11-11,Chandler>而且有个美女答应跟我约会
<11-11,Chandler>And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.

279
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,200
<11-11,Chandler>乔伊本来想约她  但她选了我
<11-11,Chandler>Joey wanted to ask her out, but, you know, she picked me.

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,100
<11-12,Phoebe>怎么会
<11-12,Phoebe>How'd that happen?

281
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,140
<11-13,Chandler>因为我比较酷
<11-13,Chandler>Because I'm cooler.

282
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,950
<11-14,Monica>不  说真的
<11-14,Monica>No, seriously.

283
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,630
<11-15,Chandler>她是那种...乔伊睡死了
<11-15,Chandler>She's the kind of girl... Joey was unconscious.

284
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,190
<11-16,Joey>你们好吗
<11-16,Joey>Hey, you guys! What's happening?

285
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,850
<11-17,Monica>天啊
<11-17,Monica>Oh, my God!

286
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,240
<11-18,Phoebe>那是什么
<11-18,Phoebe>What is that?

287
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,860
<11-19,Joey>这是睡眠诊所给我的
<11-19,Joey>They gave it to me at the sleep clinic...

288
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,910
<11-19,Joey>可以防止我打鼾
<11-19,Joey>and it's going to help me not to snore.

289
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,950
<11-20,Monica>那你现在在睡觉吗  乔伊
<11-20,Monica>Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?

290
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,520
<11-20,Monica>睡觉时候才用戴
<11-20,Monica>Because I don't think you have to wear it unless you are.

291
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,610
<11-21,Joey>我当然知道
<11-21,Joey>I know I don't have to.

292
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,970
<11-21,Joey>这玩意味道不错
<11-21,Joey>It tastes good.

293
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,950
<11-22,Chandler>而且看起来很酷
<11-22,Chandler>Plus, you look cool.

294
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,450
<12-1,Rachel>我刚给约书亚打了电话
<12-1,Rachel>I just called Joshua.

295
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,880
<12-2,Phoebe>情况怎样
<12-2,Phoebe>How'd it go?

296
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,000
<12-3,Rachel>我尽力劝他说
<12-3,Rachel>I did my best to convince him

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,020
<12-3,Rachel>我不是什么恨嫁的疯婆子
<12-3,Rachel>that I'm not some crazy girl who's dying to get married.

298
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,410
<12-3,Rachel>我只是情绪低落而已
<12-3,Rachel>And I'm going through a hard time.

299
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,500
<12-4,Phoebe>他怎么说
<12-4,Phoebe>What'd he say?

300
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,590
<12-5,Rachel>他的答录机非常体谅我
<12-5,Rachel>His answering machine was very understanding.

301
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,780
<12-5,Rachel>我好郁闷
<12-5,Rachel>I feel blue.

302
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,350
<12-6,Monica>亲爱的
<12-6,Monica>Sweetie.

303
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,150
<12-6,Monica>他一定会再找你的
<12-6,Monica>I bet you anything that he'll call you again.

304
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,720
<12-7,Rachel>或许吧  但我觉得自己根本不在乎
<12-7,Rachel>Yeah, maybe. But, you know, I don't think I even care.

305
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,190
<12-7,Rachel>我觉得让我郁闷的不是他
<12-7,Rachel>I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.

306
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,180
<12-7,Rachel>虽然我说过不在意罗斯结婚的事情
<12-7,Rachel>I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.

307
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,100
<12-7,Rachel>但是实际上...
<12-7,Rachel>But as it turns out...

308
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,790
<12-7,Rachel>我觉得自己的心态没调整好
<12-7,Rachel>I don't think I'm handling it all that well.

309
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,730
<12-8,Phoebe>或许吧
<12-8,Phoebe>Yeah, maybe.

310
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,670
<12-9,Rachel>我正在想这是为什么
<12-9,Rachel>And I'm just trying to figure out why.

311
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,140
<12-10,Phoebe>想到了吗
<12-10,Phoebe>Any luck?

312
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,020
<12-11,Rachel>罗斯和我不是一直分分合合嘛
<12-11,Rachel>You know how Ross and I have always been on-again, off-again?

313
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,920
<12-11,Rachel>我一直觉得将来的某个时候
<12-11,Rachel>I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road...

314
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,260
<12-11,Rachel>我们会再复合...
<12-11,Rachel>we would be on again.

315
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,000
<12-11,Rachel>再分手
<12-11,Rachel>Again.

316
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,690
<12-12,Monica>我们都这么觉得
<12-12,Monica>You know what? I think we all did.

317
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,920
<12-14,Monica>我订了星期天晚上的餐厅
<12-14,Monica>I got us reservations for Sunday night.

318
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,100
<12-15,Ross>9点在厄尼之家行吗
<12-15,Ross>How about Ernie's at 9:00?

319
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,020
<12-16,Rachel>你还是改成3个吧
<12-16,Rachel>Well, you'd better make it for three.

320
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,670
<12-17,Ross>下午3点我们应该还不饿
<12-17,Ross>I don't know if we're going to be hungry at three.

321
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,420
<12-18,Rachel>是3个人
<12-18,Rachel>Three people.

322
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,560
<12-18,Rachel>约书亚不去了
<12-18,Rachel>Joshua's not going to be there.

323
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,340
<12-19,Ross>怎么了
<12-19,Ross>What happened?

324
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,860
<12-20,Rachel>他应该是跟我分手了
<12-20,Rachel>Well, I think he broke up with me.

325
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,510
<12-21,Ross>天啊  为什么
<12-21,Ross>No. Why?

326
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,420
<12-22,Rachel>他太容易受惊了
<12-22,Rachel>Apparently, he scares easy.

327
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,030
<12-23,Ross>瑞秋  我很遗撼
<12-23,Ross>Rachel, I'm sorry.

328
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,140
<12-23,Ross>没关系
<12-23,Ross>It's okay.

329
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,380
<12-24,Rachel>人生不如意  十有八九
<12-24,Rachel>Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.

330
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,380
<12-25,Ross>过来
<12-25,Ross>Come here.

331
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,180
<12-26,Rachel>-你不用去接艾蜜莉吗  -是哦
<12-26,Rachel>- Don't you have to go pick up Emily? - Yeah.

332
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,070
<12-28,Rachel>-你不要紧吗  -没事  我有姐妹们陪着
<12-28,Rachel>- Are you okay? - Yeah. I got my girls.

333
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,050
<12-29,Ross>有件事可能会让你开心起来
<12-29,Ross>Hey, you know what might cheer you up?

334
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,700
<12-31,Rachel>什么
<12-31,Rachel>What?

335
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:40,970
<12-32,Phoebe>说实话
<12-32,Phoebe>I got to tell you...

336
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,340
<12-34,Rachel>我的心情真的好多了
<12-34,Rachel>this really does put me in a better mood.

337
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,600
<12-35,Monica>真希望有整天穿婚纱的工作
<12-35,Monica>I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.

338
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,270
<12-35,Monica>也许以后会有
<12-35,Monica>Maybe someday there will be.

339
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,260
<12-35,Monica>完了  是钱德勒
<12-35,Monica>Oh, god. That's Chandler,

340
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,160
<12-36,Monica>他来借晚上约会的蜡烛
<12-36,Monica>he's coming by to borrow candles for his big date.

341
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,460
<12-38,Monica>瑞秋  别开门  他会看见的
<12-38,Monica>Rachel, don't get it! He'll see us!

342
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,740
<12-39,Phoebe>新郎不能看见新娘
<12-39,Phoebe>The groom cannot see the bride.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,060
<12-40,Rachel>我又不嫁钱德勒
<12-40,Rachel>I'm not going to marry Chandler.

344
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,590
<12-41,Phoebe>见了当然就嫁不成了
<12-41,Phoebe>Not after this!

345
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,460
<12-42,Rachel>你们放轻松就好
<12-42,Rachel>Okay guys, just relax.

346
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,320
<12-43,Joshua>我愿意
<12-43,Joshua>I do!

347
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,970
<12-43,Joshua>我得走了
<12-43,Joshua>I got to go.

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,050
<12-44,Rachel>约书亚  约书亚
<12-44,Rachel>Jo-Joshua! Joshua!

349
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,270
<12-44,Rachel>好吧  吓跑他很正常
<12-44,Rachel>Yeah, well, that ought to do it.

350
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,820
<12-25,Ross>吃的在这里  很好
<12-25,Ross>Food's here. Fair enough.

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,120
<12-25,Ross>15分钟预警
<12-25,Ross>Fifteen-minute warning.
