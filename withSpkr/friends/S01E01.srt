17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,170
<1-1,Monica>这没什么好说的
<1-1,Monica>There's nothing to tell!

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,040
<1-1,Monica>他不过是我的同事
<1-1,Monica>He's just some guy I work with!

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,290
<1-2,Joey>少来了  你们都在约会了
<1-2,Joey>C'mon, you're going out with the guy!

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,340
<1-2,Joey>这个男人一定有什么问题
<1-2,Joey>There's gotta be something wrong with him!

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,910
<1-3,Chandler>他是驼背吗  戴着假发的驼背
<1-3,Chandler>So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,570
<1-4,Phoebe>等等  他吃粉笔吗
<1-4,Phoebe>Wait, does he eat chalk?

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,420
<1-5,Phoebe>我只是不想你
<1-5,Phoebe>Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,090
<1-5,Phoebe>重蹈我和卡尔的覆辙
<1-5,Phoebe>what I went through with Carl

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,320
<1-6,Monica>拜托各位  放松点  这甚至不算是约会
<1-6,Monica>Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-6,Monica>只不过是两个人出去吃个饭
<1-6,Monica>It's just two people going out to dinner

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,630
<1-6,Monica>而且不会上床
<1-6,Monica>and not having sex.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,540
<1-7,Chandler>听起来像是和我约会
<1-7,Chandler>Sounds like a date to me.

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,400
<1-8,Chandler>于是我回到了高中学校
<1-8,Chandler>Alright, so I'm back in high school,

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,990
<1-8,Chandler>我站在食堂中间
<1-8,Chandler>I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,610
<1-8,Chandler>然后发现自己全身赤裸
<1-8,Chandler>and I realize I am totally naked.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,280
<1-9,All>噢  做过那种梦
<1-9,All>Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,530
<1-10,Chandler>然后我低下头  看见那里有一部
<1-10,Chandler>Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,450
<1-10,Chandler>大哥大
<1-10,Chandler>there.

35
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,000
<1-11,Joey>-那话儿变成了  -没错
<1-11,Joey>- Instead of...?  - That's right.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,420
<1-13,Joey>-这种梦倒从未做过  -没有
<1-13,Joey>- Never had that dream. - No.

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,500
<1-15,Chandler>突然  那电话响起来了
<1-15,Chandler>All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,650
<1-16,Monica>结果是我妈打来的
<1-16,Monica>And it turns out it's my mother,

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,180
<1-17,Chandler>这非常非常奇怪
<1-17,Chandler>which is very-very weird because-

40
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,700
<1-17,Chandler>因为她从来不打电话给我
<1-17,Chandler>she never calls me!

41
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,770
<1-18,Ross>嗨
<1-18,Ross>Hi.

42
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,910
<1-19,Joey>这家伙一张嘴打招呼  我就想自杀
<1-19,Joey>This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.

43
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,580
<1-20,Monica>你还好吧  亲爱的
<1-20,Monica>Are you okay, sweetie?

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,770
<1-21,Ross>我感觉有人把手伸入我的喉咙
<1-21,Ross>I just feel like someone reached down my throat

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,630
<1-21,Ross>抓住我的小肠
<1-21,Ross>grabbed my small intestine,

46
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,820
<1-21,Ross>从我嘴里扯出来
<1-21,Ross>pulled it out of my mouth

47
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,010
<1-21,Ross>然后缠在我脖子上
<1-21,Ross>and tied it around my neck...

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,450
<1-22,Chandler>饼干
<1-22,Chandler>Cookie?

49
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,360
<1-23,Monica>卡罗尔今天把她的东西搬走了
<1-23,Monica>Carol moved her stuff out today

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,240
<1-25,Monica>-我帮你泡杯咖啡  -谢了
<1-25,Monica>- Let me get you some coffee.  - Thanks.

51
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,090
<1-26,Ross>不  不要  别再净化我的灵气了
<1-26,Ross>No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura!

52
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,470
<1-28,Ross>求你了  别碰我的灵气  好吗
<1-28,Ross>No, just leave my aura alone, okay?

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,720
<1-30,Ross>我会没事的  好吧
<1-30,Ross>I'll be fine, alright?

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,920
<1-30,Ross>真的  各位  我希望她能幸福
<1-30,Ross>Really, everyone. I hope  she'll be very happy.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,980
<1-31,Monica>-不  你不会  -没错  我不会的
<1-31,Monica>- No you don't. - No I don't,

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,510
<1-32,Ross>去她的  她甩掉了我
<1-32,Ross>to hell with her, she left me!

57
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,810
<1-33,Joey>你又不知道她是女同性恋
<1-33,Joey>And you never knew she was a lesbian...

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,560
<1-34,Ross>不知道  行了吧
<1-34,Ross>No!! Okay?!

59
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,420
<1-34,Ross>为何大家都绕着这个话题打转
<1-34,Ross>Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

60
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,780
<1-34,Ross>她都不知道  我怎么会知道
<1-34,Ross>She didn't know, how should I know?

61
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,450
<1-35,Chandler>有时我希望自己也是个女同性恋
<1-35,Chandler>Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...

62
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,490
<1-35,Chandler>我大声说出来了么

<1-49,Monica>So you wanna tell us now

85
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,080
<1-49,Monica>还是我们再等四位湿漉漉的伴娘过来
<1-49,Monica>or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

86
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,510
<1-49,Monica>噢  上帝  好吧
<1-49,Monica>Oh, God...well,

87
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,990
<1-50,Rachel>大概在婚礼前半个小时
<1-50,Rachel>it started about a half hour before the wedding.

88
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,190
<1-50,Rachel>我当时在存放礼品的房间里
<1-50,Rachel>I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents,

89
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,600
<1-50,Rachel>看着调味汁瓶
<1-50,Rachel>and I was looking at this gravy boat.

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,730
<1-50,Rachel>那是一件极其美丽的里摩日细瓷调味汁瓶
<1-50,Rachel>This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

91
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,750
<1-50,Rachel>然后  突然间
<1-50,Rachel>When all of a sudden

92
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,650
<1-50,Rachel>有糖吗
<1-50,Rachel>Sweet 'n' Lo?

93
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,410
<1-50,Rachel>我发现我对这个调味汁瓶
<1-50,Rachel>I realized that I was more turned on

94
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,760
<1-50,Rachel>比巴瑞更能引发我的兴奋感
<1-50,Rachel>by this gravy boat than by Barry!

95
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,730
<1-50,Rachel>然后我真的吓坏了
<1-50,Rachel>And then I got really freaked out,

96
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,070
<1-50,Rachel>突然想到
<1-50,Rachel>and that's when it hit me:

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,790
<1-50,Rachel>巴瑞真的超像薯头先生
<1-50,Rachel>how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,330
<1-50,Rachel>我是说  我总是觉得他眼熟
<1-50,Rachel>Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar,

99
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,700
<1-50,Rachel>但是
<1-50,Rachel>but...

100
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,970
<1-50,Rachel>不管怎么说  我必须离开那里
<1-50,Rachel>Anyway, I just had to get out of there,

101
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,630
<1-50,Rachel>我开始想
<1-50,Rachel>and I started wondering

102
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,380
<1-50,Rachel>"我干吗这么做  我这么做是为了谁"
<1-50,Rachel>"Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?"

103
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,120
<1-50,Rachel>不管怎么说  我不知该去哪里
<1-50,Rachel>So anyway I just didn't know where to go,

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,200
<1-50,Rachel>而且我知道我们有点疏远了
<1-50,Rachel>and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart,

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,370
<1-50,Rachel>但是  你是我在这个城市
<1-50,Rachel>but you're the only person I knew

106
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,990
<1-50,Rachel>唯一认识的人
<1-50,Rachel>who lived here in the city.

107
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,910
<1-51,Monica>还没有被邀请参加婚礼
<1-51,Monica>Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

108
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,530
<1-52,Rachel>噢  我希望这不是个问题
<1-52,Rachel>Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,930
<2-1,Monica>我猜他送她一台管风琴
<2-1,Monica>Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ,

110
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,800
<2-1,Monica>而她很不喜欢
<2-1,Monica>and she's really not happy about it.

111
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,670
<2-4,Rachel>爸爸  我只是  不能嫁给他
<2-4,Rachel>Daddy, I just... I can't marry him!

112
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,720
<2-4,Rachel>对不起  我只是不爱他
<2-4,Rachel>I'm sorry. I just don't love him.

113
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,180
<2-4,Rachel>可是对我来说就有关系
<2-4,Rachel>Well, it matters to me!

114
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,320
<2-6,Chandler>噢  她真不应该穿那条裤子
<2-6,Chandler>Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.

115
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,960
<2-7,Joey>要我说  推她下楼
<2-7,Joey>I say push her down the stairs.

116
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,690
<2-7,Joey>推她下楼  把推她下楼  把推她下楼
<2-7,Joey>Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

117
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,130
<2-8,Rachel>爸  你听我说
<2-8,Rachel>C'mon Daddy, listen to me!

118
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,730
<11-36,Monica>这就好像  在我一生中
<11-36,Monica>It's like, it's like, all of my life,

119
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,810
<2-8,Rachel>所有人都一直告诉我"你是一只鞋子
<2-8,Rachel>everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!

120
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,400
<2-8,Rachel>你是鞋子  你是鞋子  你是鞋子
<2-8,Rachel>You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'.

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,180
<2-8,Rachel>可今天我停下来说
<2-8,Rachel>And today I just stopped and I said,

122
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,790
<2-8,Rachel>"如果我不想成为一只鞋呢"
<2-8,Rachel>'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

123
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,690
<2-8,Rachel>如果我想当一个包包  或是一顶帽子呢
<2-8,Rachel>What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat!

124
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,230
<2-8,Rachel>不  我不是要你给我买帽子
<2-8,Rachel>No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat,

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
<2-8,Rachel>我说我是一顶帽子
<2-8,Rachel>I'm saying I am a ha-

126
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,730
<2-8,Rachel>这是比喻啦  爸爸
<2-8,Rachel>It's a metaphor, Daddy!

127
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,750
<2-9,Ross>这就是他的问题所在了
<2-9,Ross>You can see where he'd have trouble.

128
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,460
<2-10,Rachel>听着爸爸  这是我的人生
<2-10,Rachel>Look Daddy, it's my life.

129
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,140
<2-10,Rachel>也许我可以和莫妮卡住在一起
<2-10,Rachel>Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

130
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,720
<2-11,Monica>我猜和莫妮卡一起住的人选已然敲定了
<2-11,Monica>Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...

131
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,880
<2-12,Rachel>也许那是我的决定
<2-12,Rachel>Well, maybe that's my decision.

132
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,280
<2-12,Rachel>也许我不需要你的钱
<2-12,Rachel>Well, maybe I don't need your money.

133

<8-10,Monica>I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

247
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,430
<8-11,Paul>-多久了  -两年了
<8-11,Paul>- Um... how long? - Two years.

248
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,420
<8-12,Monica>我真高兴你砸烂了她的表
<8-12,Monica>Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!

249
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,790
<8-13,Paul>那你还想要第五次约会吗
<8-13,Paul>So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?

250
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,170
<8-14,Monica>是的  我希望有
<8-14,Monica>...Yeah. Yeah, I do.

251
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:31,210
<9-2,Rachel>看  乔安妮是爱卡奇的
<9-2,Rachel>Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi!

252
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,690
<9-2,Rachel>这就是不同
<9-2,Rachel>That's the difference!

253
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,990
<9-2,Rachel>"拿起勺子"
<9-2,Rachel>Grab a spoon.

254
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,290
<9-2,Rachel>你知道我拿起勺子多久了吗
<9-2,Rachel>Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon?

255
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,670
<10-1,Ross>难道"比利  别逞英雄"这句话对你没意义
<10-1,Ross>Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?

257
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,220
<10-2,Joey>还有个问题
<10-2,Joey>Y'know, here's the thing.

258
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,760
<10-4,Joey>就算我鼓足了勇气  想约个女人出来
<10-4,Joey>Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,...

259
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,810
<10-5,Ross>我又能约谁呢
<10-5,Ross>who am I gonna ask?

260
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
<10-5,Ross>不可思议吧
<10-5,Ross>Isn't this amazing?

261
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,710
<11-1,Rachel>我这辈子从没泡过咖啡
<11-1,Rachel>I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.

262
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,210
<11-2,Chandler>-真不可思议  -恭喜你了
<11-2,Chandler>- That is amazing. - Congratulations.

263
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,100
<11-5,Chandler>既然你现在正进入角色
<11-5,Chandler>While you're on a roll

264
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,530
<11-6,Joey>有没有想做个煎蛋卷之类的东西
<11-6,Joey>If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something..

265
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,210
<11-6,Joey>不过事实上我还不太饿
<11-6,Joey>Although actually I'm really not that hungry...

<11-8,All>-早安  -早安

<11-11,Rachel>- Hello, Paul. - Hi, Paul, is it?

269
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,540
<11-13,Paul>-谢谢  太感谢你了  -不要这样
<11-13,Paul>- Thank you. Thank you so much. - Stop.

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,780
<11-16,Monica>晚点联系

271
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,010
<11-17,Paul>谢谢你
<11-17,Paul>Yeah. Thank you.

272
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,840
<11-18,Joey>那还不叫真正的约会
<11-18,Joey>That wasn't a real date?!

273
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,670
<11-18,Joey>那你真正的约会到底要干些什么
<11-18,Joey>What the hell do you do on a real date?

274
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,150
<11-19,Monica>-闭嘴  把桌子抬回去  -好啦
<11-19,Monica>- Shut up, and put my table back. - Okayyy!

275
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,780
<11-20,All>好了孩子们  我必须上班去了
<11-20,All>All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

276
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,870
<11-21,Chandler>但如果我不输入那些数字
<11-21,Chandler>If I don't input those numbers...

277
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,940
<11-21,Chandler>也没什么关系
<11-21,Chandler>it doesn't make much of a difference...

278
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,200
<11-22,Rachel>你们大伙儿都有工作
<11-22,Rachel>So, like, you guys all have jobs?

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,100
<11-23,Monica>对  我们都有工作
<11-23,Monica>Yeah, we all have jobs.

280
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,030
<11-23,Monica>这样才有钱买东西
<11-23,Monica>See, that's how we buy stuff.

281
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,060
<11-24,Joey>对  我是个演员

283
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,750
<11-26,Joey>难说  大部分范围都挺小的
<11-26,Joey>I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

284
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,650
<11-27,Monica>等下  除非你碰巧看过
<11-27,Monica>Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the

<11-29,Chandler>'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'

288
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,640
<11-30,Joey>-别这么侮辱人  -你说得对  对不起
<11-30,Joey>-  I will not take this abuse.  - You're right, I'm sorry.

289

<11-31,Chandler>"我曾是个小木偶  小木偶"
<11-31,Chandler>"Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."

292
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,370
<11-32,Joey>我无法停止笑
<11-32,Joey>I can't stop smiling.

293
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,640
<11-33,Rachel>看得出来
<11-33,Rachel>I can see that.

294
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,420
<11-33,Rachel>你活像昨晚睡觉时嘴里放了个撑衣架
<11-33,Rachel>You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

295
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,240
<11-34,Monica>我知道  他是那么
<11-34,Monica>I know, he's just so, so...

296
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,280
<11-34,Monica>还记得你和托尼·德马科吗
<11-34,Monica>Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?

297
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,170
<11-35,Rachel>记得啊

<11-37,Rachel>-哇  你真是有麻烦了

<11-39,Rachel>Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work

301
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,540
<11-40,Monica>而且一整天都不要想他
<11-40,Monica>and not think about him all day.

302
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,030
<11-40,Monica>或者只是站起来去工作
<11-40,Monica>Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

303
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,290
<11-41,Rachel>-祝我好运  -为什么

<12-2,Monica>How was Florida?

308
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,180
<12-3,Frannie>你做爱了  对不
<12-3,Frannie>You had sex, didn't you?

309
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,340
<12-4,Monica>-你怎么知道的
<12-4,Monica>- How do you do that?

310
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,590
<12-5,Frannie>那么  和谁
<12-5,Frannie>So? Who?

311
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,350
<12-6,Monica>你认识保罗吧
<12-6,Monica>You know Paul?

312
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,510
<12-6,Monica>保罗  那个调酒的
<12-6,Monica>Paul the Wine Guy?

313
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,510
<12-7,Frannie>对  我认识保罗
<12-7,Frannie>Oh yeah, I know Paul.

314
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,570
<12-8,Monica>你是说你认识他就像我认识他一样
<12-8,Monica>You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

315
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,000
<12-9,Frannie>开玩笑吧  保罗还欠我一个人情呢
<12-9,Frannie>Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

316
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,600
<12-9,Frannie>遇到我之前他已有两年无法过性生活
<12-9,Frannie>Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

317
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,550
<13-1,Joey>显然他是骗你的
<13-1,Joey>Of course it was a line!

318
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,150
<13-2,Monica>为什么  为什么会有人那样做
<13-2,Monica>Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?

319
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,620
<13-3,Ross>我想你是想让我们拿出一个
<13-3,Ross>I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated

320
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,440
<13-3,Ross>比"想和你上床"更为复杂的回答
<13-3,Ross>than 'to get you into bed'.

321
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,890
<13-6,Monica>问题出在我身上
<13-6,Monica>Is it me?

322
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,830
<13-6,Monica>难道我身上带着某种味儿
<13-6,Monica>Is it like I have some sort of beacon

323
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,810
<13-6,Monica>只有狗和有严重情感问题的男人才会发觉吗
<13-6,Monica>that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

324
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,940
<13-7,Phoebe>好啦  过来  把你的脚给我
<13-7,Phoebe>All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.

325
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,660
<13-8,Monica>我只是以为他是个好男人
<13-8,Monica>I just thought he was nice, y'know?

326
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,650
<13-9,Joey>我真不相信  你不知道那是个谎言
<13-9,Joey>I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

327
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,210
<13-11,Ross>-猜猜怎么了  -你找到工作了
<13-11,Ross>- Guess what?  - You got a job?

328
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,380
<13-12,Rachel>开玩笑吗  我什么都不会
<13-12,Rachel>Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing!

329
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,120
<13-12,Rachel>今天十二个面试  我都是被嘲笑轰出来的
<13-12,Rachel>I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.

330
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,960
<13-13,Chandler>不过你却异常兴奋
<13-13,Chandler>And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

331
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,370
<13-14,Rachel>如果你遇见"约翰&大卫"的皮靴打五折
<13-14,Rachel>You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale,

332
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,280
<13-14,Rachel>也会跟我一样的
<13-14,Rachel>fifty percent off!

333
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,850
<13-15,Chandler>是呀  你多了解我啊
<13-15,Chandler>Oh, how well you know me...

334
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,710
<13-16,Rachel>这就是  我不需要工作
<13-16,Rachel>They're my new 'I don't need a job,

335
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,720
<13-16,Rachel>不需要父母  一双好皮靴足矣
<13-16,Rachel>I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!

336
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,650
<13-17,Monica>你怎么付的款
<13-17,Monica>How'd you pay for them?

337
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,030
<13-18,Rachel>用信用卡
<13-18,Rachel>Uh, credit card.

338
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,830
<13-19,Monica>那谁付账单
<13-19,Monica>And who pays for that?

339
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,410
<13-20,Rachel>我爸啊
<13-20,Rachel>Um... my... father.

340
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,950
<14-2,Monica>拜托  你不能靠你爸一辈子
<14-2,Monica>C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.

341
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,450
<14-3,Rachel>我知道  这就是为什么我要结婚
<14-3,Rachel>I know that. That's why I was getting married.

342
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,580
<14-4,Phoebe>饶了她吧  第一次独立并不轻松
<14-4,Phoebe>Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.

343
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,320
<14-5,Rachel>谢谢
<14-5,Rachel>Thank you.

344
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,850
<14-6,Phoebe>不客气  我记得我第一次来纽约时的情景
<14-6,Phoebe>You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city.

345
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,900
<14-3,Rachel>当时我十四岁
<14-3,Rachel>I was fourteen.

346
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,910
<14-6,Phoebe>我妈刚自杀  我继父再度入狱
<14-6,Phoebe>My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison,

347
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,230
<14-6,Phoebe>我来到这里  举目无亲
<14-6,Phoebe>and I got here, and I didn't know anybody.

348
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,630
<14-6,Phoebe>最后我和一个白化病患者住在一起
<14-6,Phoebe>And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,

349
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,040
<14-6,Phoebe>他给港务局的人清洗车窗玻璃
<14-6,Phoebe>cleaning windshields outside port authority,

350
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,900
<14-6,Phoebe>后来他也自杀了
<14-6,Phoebe>and then he killed himself,

351
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,000
<14-6,Phoebe>然后我成了按摩师
<14-6,Phoebe>and then I found aromatherapy.

352
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,980
<14-6,Phoebe>所以相信我  我完全了解你的感受
<14-6,Phoebe>So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

<14-7,Ross>你想要说的话是
<14-7,Ross>The word you're looking for is

354
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,520
<14-7,Ross>"无论如何"
<14-7,Ross>"Anyway"...

355
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,390
<14-8,Monica>好了准备好了吗
<14-8,Monica>All right, you ready?

356
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,310
<14-11,Rachel>-我不这么想
<14-11,Rachel>- I don't think so.

357
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:41,530
<14-14,All>剪掉  剪掉  剪掉
<14-14,All>C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
