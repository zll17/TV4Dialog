<2-7,Joey>我乔伊最爱做这种事了
<2-7,Joey>That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.

62
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,420
<2-8,Phoebe>公共广播公司
<2-8,Phoebe>Oh, PBS!

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,120
<2-9,Monica>-他们哪里不对了  -他们哪里对
<2-9,Monica>- What's wrong with PBS? - What's right with them?

64
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,390
<2-11,Joey>你为何不喜欢公共广播公司  菲比
<2-11,Joey>Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,160
<2-12,Phoebe>因为我妈自杀之后
<2-12,Phoebe>Right after my Mom killed herself,

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,730
<2-12,Phoebe>我一个人非常难过
<2-12,Phoebe>I was in a bad place, you know, personally.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,860
<2-12,Phoebe>所以我想写信给芝麻街
<2-12,Phoebe>I just thought it'll make me feel better

68
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,930
<2-12,Phoebe>心情应该会好一点
<2-12,Phoebe>if I'd write to Sesame Street-

69
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,110
<2-12,Phoebe>因为我小时候总觉得他们很亲切
<2-12,Phoebe>'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid.

70
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,000
<2-12,Phoebe>结果根本没人回信
<2-12,Phoebe>No one ever wrote back.

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,040
<2-13,Chandler>你要知道那些布偶没有大拇指
<2-13,Chandler>You know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.

72
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,130
<2-14,Phoebe>我只收到一个烂钥匙扣
<2-14,Phoebe>All I got was a lousy key chain,

73
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,240
<2-14,Phoebe>拜托  我那时住在纸箱里耶
<2-14,Phoebe>and by that time, I was living in a box.

74
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,150
<2-14,Phoebe>连钥匙都没有
<2-14,Phoebe>I didn't have keys!

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,520
<2-15,Joey>我很遗憾  菲比
<2-15,Joey>I'm sorry, Pheebs.

76
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,090
<2-15,Joey>我只是想做好事  就像你帮你弟弟生小孩
<2-15,Joey>I just wanted to do a good deed, like you did with the babies.

77
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,660
<2-16,Phoebe>你才不是做好事
<2-16,Phoebe>This isn't a good deed.

78
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,630
<2-16,Phoebe>你只是想上电视  根本就很自私
<2-16,Phoebe>You just want to get on TV. This is totally selfish.

79
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,860
<2-17,Joey>你帮你弟弟生小孩又怎么说
<2-17,Joey>What about you having those babies for your brother?

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,660
<2-18,Phoebe>自私的不是只有我
<2-18,Phoebe>Talking about selfish!

81
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,370
<2-18,Phoebe>你胡说什么
<2-18,Phoebe>What are you talking about?

82
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,130
<2-19,Joey>你的确是帮了他们
<2-19,Joey>It was a really nice thing,

83
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,810
<2-19,Joey>不过你自己心情也很好吧
<2-19,Joey>but it made you feel good, right?

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
<2-20,Phoebe>那又如何
<2-20,Phoebe>Yeah, so?

85
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,140
<2-21,Joey>让自己心情好的好事  就算是一种自私
<2-21,Joey>It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,780
<2-21,Joey>世界上根本就没有无私的好事  太遗憾了
<2-21,Joey>Look, there's no unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

87
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,720
<2-22,Phoebe>有的  有很多行善的人都没有私心
<2-22,Phoebe>Yes, there are. there are totally good deeds that are selfless!

88
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,790
<2-23,Joey>你能举出个例子来吗
<2-23,Joey>May I ask for one example?

89
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,860
<2-24,Phoebe>当然有  例如
<2-24,Phoebe>Yeah, it's... You know, there's...

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,830
<2-24,Phoebe>不  我不给你举例
<2-24,Phoebe>No, you may not!

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,690
<2-25,Joey>因为所有人都是自私的
<2-25,Joey>Because all people are selfish.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,900
<2-26,Phoebe>你说我自私吗
<2-26,Phoebe>Are you calling me selfish?

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,500
<2-26,Phoebe>你难道不是人吗
<2-26,Phoebe>Are you calling you people?

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,450
<2-27,Joey>菲比  很抱歉戳破你的美梦
<2-27,Joey>Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,

95
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,780
<2-27,Joey>但世界上没有无私的善事
<2-27,Joey>but selfless good deeds don't exist, okay?

<2-27,Joey>你也知道圣诞老人的那套把戏吧
<2-27,Joey>You know the deal on Santa Claus, right?

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,880
<2-28,Phoebe>我一定会找到一件无私的善事
<2-28,Phoebe>I'm gonna find a selfless good deed.

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,800
<2-28,Phoebe>打败你这个邪恶博士

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,820
<3-20,Ross>一定能说服她们带着本搬到伦敦
<3-20,Ross>...I could convince them to move to London with Ben.

145

151
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,560
<4-3,Joey>真好  但是
<4-3,Joey>That's great, but...

152
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,740
<4-3,Joey>应该没有人会打来找我
<4-3,Joey>I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.

153
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,430
<4-4,Stage Director>你负责接电话接受捐款
<4-4,Stage Director>No, you answer it and take pledges.

154
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,070
<4-5,Joey>可我是主持人
<4-5,Joey>But I'm the host.

155
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,840
<4-6,Stage Director>盖瑞·卡林才是主持人  你负责接电话
<4-6,Stage Director>No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phone.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,960
<4-7,Joey>你看起来还不明白
<4-7,Joey>You don't seem to understand.

157
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,280
<4-7,Joey>我以前可是德雷克·拉莫瑞医生
<4-7,Joey>I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

158
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,990
<4-8,Stage Director>你负责这支电话  医生
<4-8,Stage Director>Well, here's your phone, doctor.

159
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,620
<5-1,Phoebe>我竟然找不到一件无私的善行
<5-1,Phoebe>I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.

160
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,230
<5-1,Phoebe>你们知道我家隔壁那个老头吧
<5-1,Phoebe>You know that old guy that lives next door to me?

161
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,800
<5-1,Phoebe>我偷溜到他家  帮他打扫前廊的落叶
<5-1,Phoebe>I snuck over there and raked up the leaves on his front stoop.

162
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,060
<5-1,Phoebe>他捉到我之后  强迫我喝饮料吃饼干
<5-1,Phoebe>But he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.

163
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,240
<5-1,Phoebe>可是我却很开心  那个老混蛋
<5-1,Phoebe>Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!

164
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,470
<5-2,Rachel>或许乔伊说得对
<5-2,Rachel>Maybe Joey's right.

165
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,410
<5-2,Rachel>所有好事的出发点都有私心
<5-2,Rachel>Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

166
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,750
<5-3,Phoebe>我一定要找到一件无私的善行
<5-3,Phoebe>I will find a selfless good deed.

167
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,120
<5-3,Phoebe>毕竟我才刚生出三个宝宝
<5-3,Phoebe>I just gave birth to three children...

168
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,150
<5-3,Phoebe>不能让他们在乔伊有理的世界里长大
<5-3,Phoebe>...and I won't let them be raised in a world where Joey's right!

169
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,290
<5-4,Chandler>莫妮卡

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,490
<5-6,Chandler>如果你在炉子上烹饪
<5-6,Chandler>If you're cooking on the stove...

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,500
<5-6,Chandler>是否代表你的新地下情人
<5-6,Chandler>...that means your new secret boyfriend

173
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,630
<5-6,Chandler>在床上比理查德还厉害

177
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,910
<5-8,Monica>为什么
<5-8,Monica>Why?

178
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,680
<5-9,Chandler>如果我是他
<5-9,Chandler>If this guy was me...

179
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,690
<5-9,Chandler>又知道自己
<5-9,Chandler>...and it's me who'd learned that

180
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,220
<5-9,Chandler>是你碰到过的最棒的情人
<5-9,Chandler>it was me who was the best you'd ever had...

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,780
<5-9,Chandler>我一定乐歪了
<5-9,Chandler>...I'd be like this:

182
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,030
<6-1,Ross>艾蜜莉
<6-1,Ross>All right, Emily.

183
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,160
<6-1,Ross>虽然我很爱你
<6-1,Ross>As much as I love you...

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,770
<6-1,Ross>抱歉  但我不能丢下本去伦敦
<6-1,Ross>...l'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.

185
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,840
<6-2,Emily>我知道这很为难你
<6-2,Emily>I understand that would be difficult.

186
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,800
<6-3,Ross>请你考虑下搬过来好吗
<6-3,Ross>Would you please consider moving here?

187
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,810
<6-3,Ross>你本来就打算搬来
<6-3,Ross>I mean you were moving here anyway.

188
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,950
<6-3,Ross>为何不现在就来呢
<6-3,Ross>Why can't you just do that?

189
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,480
<6-4,Emily>我不知道  只是
<6-4,Emily>I don't know. It's just...

190
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,780
<6-4,Emily>好吧  好吧
<6-4,Emily>Okay, okay.

191
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,190
<6-5,Ross>我知道自己到目前为止的表现
<6-5,Ross>But I know that even though I've been

192
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,560
<6-5,Ross>都是彻头彻尾的白痴
<6-5,Ross>a complete idiot up till now...

193

<6-5,Ross>但你还是应该过来
<6-5,Ross>...you have to come here.

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,860
<6-5,Ross>你必须来  这样我们才能继续走下去
<6-5,Ross>You have to, so we can work this out together-

195
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,160
<6-6,Emily>好吧

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,860
<6-7,Ross>"好吧"  你刚说"好"吗
<6-7,Ross>"All right"? Did you just say "all right"?

197
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,630
<6-8,Emily>没错  现在换我是白痴了
<6-8,Emily>I did. Now I'm the idiot.

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,510
<6-9,Ross>我们就像坠入爱河的白痴
<6-9,Ross>We're gonna be like two idiots in love!

201
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,120
<6-10,Emily>罗斯  有件事还是让我很担心
<6-10,Emily>Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.

202
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,690
<6-11,Ross>-你尽管说  -你要知道
<6-11,Ross>- Yes, tell me. - You have to understand...

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,790
<6-12,Emily>婚礼那天我有多丢脸
<6-12,Emily>...how humiliating it was for me at the altar...

204
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,190
<6-12,Emily>在我的亲朋好友面前
<6-12,Emily>...in front of my family and all friends.

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,360
<6-13,Ross>我知道  我非常抱歉
<6-13,Ross>I know. I am so sorry.

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,360
<6-14,Emily>然后  当我决定原谅你
<6-14,Emily>And then, after deciding to forgive you...

207
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,940
<6-14,Emily>却在机场  看到你跟她赶着上飞机
<6-14,Emily>...seeing you at the airport, catching our plane with her.

208
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,060
<6-15,Ross>这也是我的错
<6-15,Ross>Again, very sorry.

209
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,950
<6-16,Emily>我是说我根本无法与她共处一室
<6-16,Emily>I mean, I can't be in the same room as her.

210
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,770
<6-16,Emily>我光想到你跟她共处一室就快气坏了
<6-16,Emily>It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her.

211
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,280
<6-17,Ross>艾蜜莉  我跟瑞秋根本没什么
<6-17,Ross>Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.

212
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
<6-17,Ross>好吗
<6-17,Ross>Okay?

213

<6-18,Emily>I'll come to New York, and we'll try to make this work.

216
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,430
<6-19,Ross>太好了
<6-19,Ross>That's so great!

217
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,230
<6-20,Emily>只要你答应不再见瑞秋
<6-20,Emily>As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.

218
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,740
<7-1,Ross>我就问艾蜜莉愿不愿意来纽约
<7-1,Ross>I asked Emily if she would come to New York.

219
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,570
<7-1,Ross>她答应了
<7-1,Ross>And she said yes.

220
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,840
<7-2,Chandler>-太好了  -好棒
<7-2,Chandler>- Yes! - Great!

221

<7-4,Monica>No, no, no!

222
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,510
<7-5,Ross>条件是我不准再见瑞秋
<7-5,Ross>Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.

223
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,180
<7-7,Monica>什么  你不可以...
<7-7,Monica>What? You can't...

224
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,090
<7-7,Monica>-你怎么说的  -我说我得考虑下
<7-7,Monica>- What did you tell her? - I told her I have to think about it.

225
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,210
<7-8,Ross>我到底该怎么决定
<7-8,Ross>How the hell am I supposed to make this kind of decision?

226
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,260
<7-8,Ross>我这是在问你们
<7-8,Ross>I'm actually asking you!

227
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,930
<7-9,Chandler>你不能从此不见瑞秋
<7-9,Chandler>You can't just not see Rachel anymore,

231
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,750
<7-12,Chandler>但是  你跟瑞秋从中学就认识
<7-12,Chandler>But, you've known Rachel since high school,

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,770
<7-13,Phoebe>你不能说不见就不见瑞秋了

<11-2,Monica>你怎么可以用玩具决定命运
<11-2,Monica>You can't be serious. You can't make this decision with a toy!

290
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,160
<11-3,Phoebe>这可不是玩具

302
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,690
<11-4,Ross>待会再问
<11-4,Ross>"Ask Again Later."

303
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,970
<11-4,Ross>这个答案不够好
<11-4,Ross>Later is not good enough!

304
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,600
<11-4,Ross>待会再问  怎么回事
<11-4,Ross>"Ask Again Later." What the hell?

309

<12-5,Joey>你确定吗  菲比  芝麻街可是伤你不浅
<12-5,Joey>You sure? Pheebs, after what Sesame Street did to you?

317
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,560
<12-6,Phoebe>我还是很生气  但是我知道
<12-6,Phoebe>I'm still mad at them, but I also know

318
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,790
<12-6,Phoebe>很多妈妈没自杀的
<12-6,Phoebe>they bring happiness to lots of kids

319
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,180
<12-6,Phoebe>小孩很爱看
<12-6,Phoebe>whose moms didn't kill themselves.

320
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,390
<12-6,Phoebe>为了支持这节目
<12-6,Phoebe>You know, so... By supporting them,

321
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,990
<12-6,Phoebe>我决定做件好事  不过我自己可不开心
<12-6,Phoebe>I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.

322
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,780
<12-6,Phoebe>你看  这就是无私的善行
<12-6,Phoebe>So there! A selfless good deed.

323
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,170
<12-7,Joey>难道你捐钱没有一点开心吗
<12-7,Joey>You don't feel a little good about donating the money?

324
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,390
<12-8,Phoebe>难过死了  我本想用这笔钱买只仓鼠
<12-8,Phoebe>No, it sucks! I was saving up to buy a hamster.

325
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,690
<12-9,Joey>仓鼠  那种宠物十元就买得到
<12-9,Joey>A hamster? Those things are, like, $ 10.

326
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,130
<12-10,Phoebe>我喜欢的那只可没那么便宜
<12-10,Phoebe>Not the one I had my eye on.

340
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,420

<13-1,Chandler>Maybe I got carried away before,

341
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,710
<13-1,Chandler>不过有件事要告诉你
<13-1,Chandler>but there's something you got to know.

342
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,410
<13-1,Chandler>如果我表现得很好  也是因为你
<13-1,Chandler>If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.

343
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,890
<13-2,Monica>说下去
<13-2,Monica>Keep talking.

344
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,620
<13-3,Chandler>跟你在一起之前  我根本表现平平
<13-3,Chandler>I was nothing before you.

345
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,090
<13-3,Chandler>你可以打去问我以前那些女友
<13-3,Chandler>Call the other girls and ask.

346
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,020
<13-3,Chandler>你一定很快就问完了
<13-3,Chandler>Which wouldn't take long.

347
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,330
<13-3,Chandler>但是我跟你  我们在一起
<13-3,Chandler>But when I'm with you, and we're together...

<13-5,Chandler>如果你不想再跟我上床  我也能体谅
<13-5,Chandler>Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.

351
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,180
<13-5,Chandler>不过这决定是错的
<13-5,Chandler>But that would be wrong.

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,910
<13-5,Chandler>我们太厉害了
<13-5,Chandler>We're too good.

357
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,030
<13-7,Chandler>我们应该不需要等他吧
<13-7,Chandler>I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.

358
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,770
<13-7,Chandler>没关系  手套不用脱
<13-7,Chandler>No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.
