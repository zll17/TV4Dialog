00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,860
<5-7,Joey>我的经纪人说这个角色不必跳舞
<5-7,Joey>My agent said that there wasn't a dancing part.

<5-8,Director>乔伊  所有的角色都要跳一点舞
<5-8,Director>Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.

151
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,890
<5-8,Director>相信我  以你的舞蹈背景  这是小菜一碟
<5-8,Director>But believe me, with your dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.

171
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,530
<6-11,Monica>突然之间  他停下来写了首诗
<6-11,Monica>and all of a sudden he stops to write a poem.

172
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,140
<6-12,Joey>少来了  我就算被陨石打中也停不下来

176
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,830
<6-15,Monica>总之  他走的时候忘了把这首诗带走
<6-15,Monica>Anyway, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him.

177

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,580
<9-3,Chandler>你还看不出来吗
<9-3,Chandler>Don't you see what's happening here?

234
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,630
<9-3,Chandler>他没有勾引她  反而做了她的知己
<9-3,Chandler>Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidante.

235
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,990
<9-3,Chandler>现在她就会跑去跟他抱怨你
<9-3,Chandler>Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to, to complain about you.

236
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,040
<9-4,Ross>我该怎么办
<9-4,Ross>What am I gonna do?

237
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,060
<9-5,Chandler>何不送她一个音乐金龟
<9-5,Chandler>Well why don't you send her a musical bug?

238
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,270
<9-5,Chandler>不  你已经送过了

240
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,690
<9-5,Chandler>偶尔让她惊喜一下
<9-5,Chandler>Okay, make a few surprise visits.

241
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,620
<9-6,Ross>我不知道
<9-6,Ross>I don't know, you guys.

242
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,100
<9-7,Chandler>很好  不要轻举妄动
<9-7,Chandler>All right, fine, don't do anything.

243
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
<9-7,Chandler>坐着跟我们聊天好了
<9-7,Chandler>Just sit here and talk to us.

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,790
<9-7,Chandler>这时候  她正在跟他谈你
<9-7,Chandler>Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.

245
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,030
<9-7,Chandler>他对她体贴入微
<9-7,Chandler>And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

246
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,320
<9-7,Chandler>她开始想  "也许他就是我的伴侣
<9-7,Chandler>She's start thinking, "Maybe this's the guy for me

247
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,080
<9-7,Chandler>他这么了解我"
<9-7,Chandler>because he understands me."

248
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,110
<9-8,Joey>你还没搞清楚状况  她就跟他在一起了
<9-8,Joey>And before you know it, she's with him.

249
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,780
<9-8,Joey>你就会说"老天"
<9-8,Joey>And you'll be all, "Oh, man!"

250
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,580
<9-8,Joey>他会说"太棒了"
<9-8,Joey>And he'll be all, "Yes!"

251
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,260
<9-8,Joey>我们都会说"哥们儿"
<9-8,Joey>And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude!"

252
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,540
<9-8,Joey>很快你就会说
<9-8,Joey>And pretty soon you'll be like:

<9-8,Joey>"嗨"
<9-8,Joey>"Hi."

280
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,430
<11-2,Joey>这表示试镜取消了吗
<11-2,Joey>So, does that mean the audition's off?

281
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,970
<11-3,Director>乔伊  既然你的经验丰富
<11-3,Director>Listen, Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience...

291
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,050
<11-6,Joey>这么说是踏步舞步和爵士手势
<11-6,Joey>So that's, "Steppity-step and jazz hands."

292
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,410
<11-7,Director>跳得高兴点
<11-7,Director>Have fun.

293
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,250
<12-2,Monica>再见
<12-2,Monica>Bye.

294
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,740
<12-3,Phoebe>你在包什么
<12-3,Phoebe>What are you wrapping?

295
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,930
<12-4,Monica>看我送胡利欧什么
<12-4,Monica>Look what I got Julio.

296
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,100
<12-5,Phoebe>是个花瓶
<12-5,Phoebe>It's a vase.

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,480
<12-6,Monica>就像他那首诗
<12-6,Monica>Just like the one in the poem.

298
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,100
<12-7,Phoebe>不完全跟那首诗一样
<12-7,Phoebe>Not exactly like the one in the poem.

299
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,240
<12-8,Monica>此话怎讲
<12-8,Monica>What do you mean?

300
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,970
<12-9,Phoebe>记得你说过你看不懂诗吗
<12-9,Phoebe>Remember how you said that you were really dense about poetry?

301
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,880
<12-9,Phoebe>是的
<12-9,Phoebe>Yeah.

302
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,880
<13-1,Monica>这么说我只是个空洞的花瓶
<13-1,Monica>So I'm just an empty vase?

303
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,210
<13-2,Julio>什么
<13-2,Julio>What?

304
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,570
<13-3,Monica>我不像你那样常看名著
<13-3,Monica>So, I don't read as many important books as you do.

305
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,440
<13-3,Monica>我也不写表里不一的怪诗
<13-3,Monica>And I don't write trick poems

306
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,020
<13-3,Monica>看起来是一回事  其实是另一回事
<13-3,Monica>that seems about one thing, but actully about something else.

307
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,510
<13-3,Monica>愚蠢的东西令我很激动
<13-3,Monica>And you know what, I get excited about stupid stuff...

308
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,220
<13-3,Monica>比如说周六到的《人物》杂志
<13-3,Monica>like when my People magazine comes on Saturday...

309
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,770
<13-3,Monica>"应有尽有"商店新一期的购物目录
<13-3,Monica>and the new "Hold Everything" catalog.

310
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,220
<13-3,Monica>但这并不表示我是空洞的
<13-3,Monica>You know, but that doesn't mean I'm empty.

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,900
<13-3,Monica>我关心我的家人和朋友
<13-3,Monica>I care about things. I care about my friends and family.

312
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,660
<13-3,Monica>你没有权利批判我
<13-3,Monica>You have no right to make that kind of judgement!

313
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,850
<13-5,Monica>你根本不了解我
<13-5,Monica>You don't even know me!

314
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,350
<13-6,Julio>这首诗讲的不是你
<13-6,Julio>The poem is not about you.

315
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,790
<13-7,Monica>什么
<13-7,Monica>What?

316
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,330
<13-8,Julio>"空花瓶"讲的不是你
<13-8,Julio>"The Empty Vase" is not about you.

317
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,400
<13-8,Julio>我亲爱的美女
<13-8,Julio>My baby preciosa....

318
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,810
<13-8,Julio>你居然这么想  我好难过
<13-8,Julio>You make me so sad that you would think this.

319
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,690
<13-9,Monica>对不起  这...
<13-9,Monica>I'm sorry. It's....

320
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,160
<13-9,Monica>我朋友菲比说...
<13-9,Monica>My friend Phoebe said...

321
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,870
<13-10,Julio>这是讲所有的女人
<13-10,Julio>No. It's about all women.

322
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,820
<13-10,Julio>应该是说
<13-10,Julio>Well...

323
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,160
<13-10,Julio>全美国的女人
<13-10,Julio>all American women.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,750
<13-10,Julio>释怀了没有
<13-10,Julio>You feel better now?

325
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,500
<13-10,Julio>是啊
<13-10,Julio>Oh yeah.

328
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,990
<14-2,Director>那是什么玩意儿
<14-2,Director>What was that?

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,460
<14-3,Joey>他们最多只能跳到这个程度
<14-3,Joey>It's the best I could get out of them.

330
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,450
<14-4,Director>各位
<14-4,Director>Well, people!

339
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,370
<15-4,Chandler>然后再按一下  她又穿上衣服了
<15-4,Chandler>And then you click it again and she's dressed.

<15-7,Chandler>You know what? I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.

344
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,000
<15-8,Ross>对不起  我是个白痴
<15-8,Ross>I'm sorry. I was an idiot.

346
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,340
<15-9,Rachel>大白痴

347
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,890
<15-10,Ross>只是你必须了解
<15-10,Ross>It's just, you have to realize...

348
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,720
<15-10,Ross>马克这件事  让我很难受
<15-10,Ross>this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.

349
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,770
<15-11,Rachel>为什么  我们在一起快一年了
<15-11,Rachel>Why is it hard? We've been together for almost a year now.

350
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,640
<15-12,Ross>我跟卡罗尔在一起八年了
<15-12,Ross>Well, I was with Carol for, like, eight years.

351
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,920
<15-12,Ross>而我失去了她
<15-12,Ross>And I lost her.

352
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,380
<15-12,Ross>如果有这个可能  我想我爱你比爱她更深
<15-12,Ross>And now, if it's possible, I think I love you even more.

353
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,020
<15-12,Ross>所以我很难相信我不会...
<15-12,Ross>So it's hard for me to believe I'm not gonna...

354
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,890
<15-12,Ross>别人不会把你夺走
<15-12,Ross>well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.

<15-13,Gunther>让我夺走她吧
<15-13,Gunther>Let it be me. Let it be me!

<15-14,Rachel>亲爱的  你的话好窝心
<15-14,Rachel>Honey, that's very sweet.

357
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,070
<15-14,Rachel>我只是觉得  如果两个人彼此相爱
<15-14,Rachel>It just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other...

358
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,530
<15-14,Rachel>彼此信任  像我们这样
<15-14,Rachel>and trust each other, like we do...

359
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,740
<15-14,Rachel>就没有理由嫉妒
<15-14,Rachel>there's no reason to be jealous.

360
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,230
<15-15,Ross>我得走了
<15-15,Ross>I gotta get going.

<15-16,Chandler>罗斯  这支笔有点无聊了
<15-16,Chandler>Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen's getting kind of boring.

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,670
<15-16,Chandler>可以帮我拿几本色情杂志吗
<15-16,Chandler>So can you pick me up some porn?
