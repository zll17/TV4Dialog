92
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,490
<4-1,Phoebe>就像在背叛钱德勒
<4-1,Phoebe>that's like betraying Chandler.

111
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,400

<5-1,Joey>This does not mean acting again.

112
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,650
<5-1,Joey>而是你没有台词  但可以听别人讲
<5-1,Joey>It means you don't have a line, but someone else just did.

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,970
<5-1,Joey>就像这样
<5-1,Joey>And it goes something like this:

143
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,470
<6-20,Phoebe>有些男生可不像基督徒
<6-20,Phoebe>and some of the young men weren't acting Christian enough.

144
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,230
<6-22,Joey>别闹了  喂

160
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,730
<7-6,Dr. Green>图书馆还好吗
<7-6,Dr. Green>How's the library?

161
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,070
<7-7,Ross>是博物馆
<7-7,Ross>Museum.

162
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,540
<7-8,Dr. Green>-那图书馆呢  -没有图书馆
<7-8,Dr. Green>- What happened to the library? - There never was a library.

163
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,230
<7-9,Ross>是有图书馆  只不过
<7-9,Ross>I mean, there are libraries. It's just...

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,380
<7-9,Ross>我没在图书馆做过事
<7-9,Ross>that I've never worked at one.

165
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,810
<7-10,Dr. Green>知道这里的名菜是什么吗  龙虾
<7-10,Dr. Green>You know what's really good here? The lobster.

166
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,460
<7-10,Dr. Green>你们说我直接点三份如何
<7-10,Dr. Green>What do you say? Shall I just order three?

167
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,160
<7-11,Ross>如果你当真如饥似渴
<7-11,Ross>Yeah, if you're really hungry.

168
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,210
<7-11,Ross>开玩笑  我开玩笑的
<7-11,Ross>It was a joke. I made a joke.

169
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,180
<7-12,Rachel>爸爸  其实罗斯对龙虾过敏
<7-12,Rachel>Actually, daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.

170
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,150
<7-13,Dr. Green>什么人会对龙虾过敏啊
<7-13,Dr. Green>What kind of person's allergic to lobster?

171
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,690
<7-13,Dr. Green>我猜只有图书管理员才会
<7-13,Dr. Green>I guess the kind of person that works in a library.

172
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,590
<7-14,Ross>-不是...  -我知道  是博物馆
<7-14,Ross>- It's not... - I know. It's a museum!

173
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,660
<7-15,Dr. Green>难道只有你可以开玩笑吗
<7-15,Dr. Green>Why? You're the only around here who can make a joke?

174
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,080
<7-15,Dr. Green>至少我的很好笑
<7-15,Dr. Green>At least mine was funny.

175
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,030
<7-15,Dr. Green>服务员
<7-15,Dr. Green>Waiter.

<7-15,Dr. Green>We will have two lobsters and a menu.

177
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,720
<8-1,Ross>格林医生  你的船好吗
<8-1,Ross>So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?

178
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,010
<8-2,Dr. Green>生锈了  你知道生锈船会怎样吗
<8-2,Dr. Green>They found rust. Do you know what rust does to a boat?

179
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,000
<8-3,Ross>让船看起来像古董
<8-3,Ross>Gives it a nice antique-y look?

180
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,020
<8-4,Dr. Green>锈是船的癌症  罗斯
<8-4,Dr. Green>Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

181
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,410
<8-5,Ross>我真遗憾
<8-5,Ross>Wow, I'm sorry.

182
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,710
<8-5,Ross>我小时候就这样失去了一台脚踏车
<8-5,Ross>When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.

183
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,900
<8-6,Dr. Green>失陪一下
<8-6,Dr. Green>Excuse me for a moment, will you please?

184
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,420
<8-6,Dr. Green>我想在离开前问候下莱文家的人
<8-6,Dr. Green>I wanna say good night to the Levines before we go.

185
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,420
<8-8,Ross>好的
<8-8,Ross>Okay.

186
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,830
<8-9,Rachel>亲爱的  别这样  没那么糟
<8-9,Rachel>Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

187
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,180
<8-10,Ross>你爸一定算错了  他只给了4%的小费
<8-10,Ross>I think your dad must have added wrong. He only tipped like 4%.

188
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,010
<8-11,Rachel>是啊  我爸就是这样
<8-11,Rachel>Yeah. That's daddy.

189
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,170
<8-11,Rachel>我爸就是这样
<8-11,Rachel>"That's daddy"?

190
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,710
<8-12,Ross>你不困扰吗  你就是服务生
<8-12,Ross>Doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.

191
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,840
<8-13,Rachel>我的确很困扰  罗斯
<8-13,Rachel>Yes, it bothers me, Ross.

192
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,140
<8-13,Rachel>如果他是咖啡馆的常客
<8-13,Rachel>But, you know. If he was a regular at the coffee house,

193
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,900
<8-13,Rachel>我会冲他的咖啡打喷嚏
<8-13,Rachel>I'd be serving him sneezers.

194
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,420
<8-15,Rachel>-所以呢  -所以  罗斯
<8-15,Rachel>- So? - So, Ross...

195
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,390
<8-15,Rachel>我跟他说过无数遍了  他不会改变的
<8-15,Rachel>I've bugged him about this a million times. He's not gonna change.

196
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,250
<8-16,Ross>你真的会冲咖啡打喷嚏吗
<8-16,Ross>Do you really serve people sneezers?

197
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,290
<8-17,Rachel>反正我不会
<8-17,Rachel>Well, I don't.

198
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,090
<8-18,Dr Green>孩子们  可以走了吗
<8-18,Dr Green>All right, kids. Ready?

199
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,780
<8-19,Ross>格林医生  再次谢谢你
<8-19,Ross>Thanks again, Dr. Green.

200
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,850
<8-20,Dr. Green>等一下
<8-20,Dr. Green>Wait...

201
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,120
<8-21,Dr. Green>我忘了拿收据
<8-21,Dr. Green>I think I forgot my receipt.

202
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,810
<8-22,Ross>-不要拿了  -为什么
<8-22,Ross>- You don't need that. - Why not?

203
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,740
<8-23,Dr. Green>复写纸很脏  沾到手指上
<8-23,Dr. Green>The carbon. It's messy. I mean, gets on your fingers

204
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,300
<8-24,Ross>会引发
<8-24,Ross>and causes the...

205
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,720
<8-24,Ross>夜盲症
<8-24,Ross>night blindness.

206
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,910
<8-25,Dr. Green>这是什么
<8-25,Dr. Green>What is this?

207
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,340
<8-25,Dr. Green>谁放了二十块  是谁
<8-25,Dr. Green>Who put a 20 down here? Huh?

208
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,370
<8-26,Ross>对啊  应该是我
<8-26,Ross>Oh, yeah, that would be me.

209
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,550
<8-26,Ross>我有一个毛病
<8-26,Ross>I have a problem.

210
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,650
<8-26,Ross>我给的小费太高了  太高了
<8-26,Ross>I tip way too much. Way too much.

211
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,830
<8-27,Rachel>-这是一种病  -没错
<8-27,Rachel>- It's a sickness, really. - Yeah, it is.

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,970
<8-27,Rachel>-我们得想个办法  -别说了
<8-27,Rachel>- We really really have to do something about that. - Excuse me.

213
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,040
<8-29,Dr. Green>你觉得我很小气吗
<8-29,Dr. Green>You think I'm cheap?

214
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,090
<8-30,Rachel>爸  他没有那个意思  真的
<8-30,Rachel>Oh daddy, he didn't mean anything by that. He really didn't.

215
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,820
<8-31,Ross>我做的事都没有意义  真的
<8-31,Ross>Nothing I do means anything. Really.

216
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,990
<8-32,Dr. Green>真好啊  我花两百块请客
<8-32,Dr. Green>This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.

217
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,620
<8-32,Dr. Green>你只放了二十块就成了大少爷
<8-32,Dr. Green>You put down $20 and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot.

218
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,940
<8-32,Dr. Green>你那么想当大少爷吗
<8-32,Dr. Green>You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?

219
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,760
<8-32,Dr. Green>这样吧
<8-32,Dr. Green>Here. I'll tell you what:

220
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,200
<8-32,Dr. Green>钱都给你出  大少爷
<8-32,Dr. Green>You pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot. All right?

221
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,480
<8-33,Ross>"大少爷"总比"油头"好
<8-33,Ross>Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better than "Wet-Head. "

222
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,110
<9-1,Joey>现在教你们几个小诀窍
<9-1,Joey>Okay, some tricks of the trade.

223
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,080
<9-1,Joey>我演戏一向哭不出来
<9-1,Joey>Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor.

224
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,150
<9-1,Joey>所以要是我得哭
<9-1,Joey>So if I'm in a scene where I have to cry,

225
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,160
<9-1,Joey>我就把裤子口袋挖一个洞
<9-1,Joey>I cut a hole in my pocket...

226
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,890
<9-1,Joey>放一把镊子在里面
<9-1,Joey>take a pair of tweezers...

227
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,450
<9-1,Joey>然后开始拔毛
<9-1,Joey>and just start pulling.

228
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,870
<9-1,Joey>如果我想表现
<9-1,Joey>Okay, or let's say I wanna convey...

229
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,600
<9-1,Joey>刚做了坏事的感觉
<9-1,Joey>that I've just done something evil.

230
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
<9-1,Joey>就秀出那个
<9-1,Joey>That would be your basic

231
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,740
<9-1,Joey>"眉毛鱼钩我喜欢"的表情
<9-1,Joey>I've-got-a-fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.

232
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,950
<9-1,Joey>要是我听到一个坏消息
<9-1,Joey>Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

233
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,690
<9-1,Joey>只要心算232除以13就行了
<9-1,Joey>Well, all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.

234
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,810
<9-1,Joey>就是这样
<9-1,Joey>And that's how it's done.

235
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,070
<9-1,Joey>今晚的课上得很愉快
<9-1,Joey>Great soap opera acting tonight, everybody.

236
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,540
<9-1,Joey>下课
<9-1,Joey>Class dismissed.

237
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,400
<9-2,Student>-崔老师  -你好
<9-2,Student>- Hey, Mr. Trib. - Hey.

238
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,980
<9-4,Student>你猜怎么着  我要去试镜了
<9-4,Student>Guess what? I got an audition!

239
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,060
<9-5,Joey>我的学生要试镜了  我好骄傲
<9-5,Joey>One of my students got an audition. I'm so proud!

240
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,480
<9-6,Student>能不能请您指导我一下
<9-6,Student>I was wondering if you'd consider coaching me for it.

241
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,070
<9-7,Joey>当然可以  是什么角色
<9-7,Joey>You bet! What's the part?

242
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,100
<9-8,Student>那个角色很棒
<9-8,Student>Oh, it's great!

243
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,080
<9-8,Student>是《我的孩子们》里的拳击手尼克
<9-8,Student>It's a role on All My Children. Nick the boxer.

244
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,620
<10-1,Rachel>你非得这样吗  就不能睁只眼闭只眼吗
<10-1,Rachel>You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,630
<10-2,Ross>才4%
<10-2,Ross>Four percent, okay?

246
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,330
<10-2,Ross>就算菜里有虫  我也给的比他多
<10-2,Ross>I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.

247
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,290
<10-3,Rachel>罗斯  今晚吃饭是为了让你们好好相处
<10-3,Rachel>Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.

248
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,090
<10-3,Rachel>你快去找我的按摩治疗师好吗
<10-3,Rachel>Would you just see my chiropractor already?

249
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,830
<10-3,Rachel>是啊
<10-3,Rachel>Yeah,

250
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,030
<10-4,Ross>一个没念过医科的治疗师
<10-4,Ross>I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school in a mini-mall.

251
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,810
<10-5,Ross>菲比  你在干什么
<10-5,Ross>Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

252
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,830
<10-6,Phoebe>我快吓死了
<10-6,Phoebe>I'm freaking out!

253
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,930
<10-6,Phoebe>莫妮卡交待我办一件事  她不该这么做
<10-6,Phoebe>Monica kind of trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!

254
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,140
<10-6,Phoebe>我搬走一阵子了  所以我得问你
<10-6,Phoebe>I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.

255
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,380
<10-6,Phoebe>莫妮卡依然会开卧室灯吗
<10-6,Phoebe>Does Monica still turn the lights on in her bedroom?

256
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,300
<10-7,Rachel>没错

257
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,730
<10-8,Phoebe>我死定了

258
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,050
<10-9,Rachel>好了  最重要的是  罗斯
<10-9,Rachel>All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross.

259
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,720
<10-9,Rachel>赶紧补救还来得及
<10-9,Rachel>This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

260
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,580
<10-9,Rachel>我请他明天来吃早午餐  你可以示好
<10-9,Rachel>So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow, and you can make nice.

261
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,890
<10-10,Ross>亲爱的  我示好过了  没有用
<10-10,Ross>Honey, I have tried to make nice. It doesn't work.

262
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,020
<10-11,Rachel>罗斯  我知道我爸很难相处
<10-11,Rachel>Okay, look, Ross, I realize my father is difficult.

263
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,750
<10-11,Rachel>所以你一定要比他大方
<10-11,Rachel>But that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.

264
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,310
<10-12,Ross>亲爱的  我可以比他大方
<10-12,Ross>Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man.

265
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,170
<10-12,Ross>我可以超级大方
<10-12,Ross>I could be the biggest man.

266
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,430
<10-12,Ross>就算我当一个巨人
<10-12,Ross>I could be a big, huge, giant man,

267
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,020
<10-12,Ross>事情也不会改变
<10-12,Ross>it still wouldn't make a difference.

268
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,060
<10-12,Ross>除非我可以把你爸拎起来说
<10-12,Ross>Except I could pick your father up and say,

269
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,350
<10-12,Ross>喜欢我吧  小医生
<10-12,Ross>"Like me! Like me, tiny doctor!"

<10-13,Rachel>Can't you just try it one more time, Ross?

271
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,390
<10-13,Rachel>就当是为了我
<10-13,Rachel>For me? For me?

272
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,010
<10-14,Ross>瑞秋  一顿早午餐解决不了问题
<10-14,Ross>Rachel, one brunch is not gonna solve anything.

273
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,170
<10-14,Ross>面对现实吧  我们合不来
<10-14,Ross>You got face it, okay? We're never gonna get along.
