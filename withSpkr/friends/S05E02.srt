119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,490
<3-6,Rachel>这都要怪我

126
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,800
<3-11,Monica>你要是肯放下罗斯一分钟
<3-11,Monica>If you'd stop thinking about Ross for on minute...

<3-13,Monica>还有那边那个家伙
<3-13,Monica>What about that guy over there?

132
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,170
<3-13,Monica>你以前跟他在吧台还打情骂俏过呢
<3-13,Monica>That's the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.

133
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,360
<3-14,Rachel>我不知道...
<3-14,Rachel>Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

<3-15,Monica>We made a deal. I make your decisions,

136
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,210
<3-15,Monica>我命令你去跟他说话
<3-15,Monica>and I say you're going to talk to him.

162
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,770
<4-6,Monica>可能是在伦敦学到的欧洲告别风俗
<4-6,Monica>Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.

163
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,600
<4-7,Rachel>那才不是欧洲风俗
<4-7,Rachel>That's not European.

164

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,380
<5-11,Rachel>那是什么
<5-11,Rachel>What's that?

177
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,640
<5-12,Ross>我今天收到的包裹
<5-12,Ross>It came in the mail today, it's...

<5-14,Ross>还好啦
<5-14,Ross>It's not so bad.

<5-14,Ross>莫妮卡要用来做香料
<5-14,Ross>Monica's going to make potpourri.

184
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,140
<5-14,Ross>我要去淋雨散散心
<5-14,Ross>I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.

<5-15,Rachel>外面没下雨
<5-15,Rachel>It's not raining.

<5-17,Rachel>嗨  大卫
<5-17,Rachel>Hey, Dave.

193
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,300
<5-19,Rachel>改天再请你进来  我的室友病得很重
<5-19,Rachel>Listen, I need to take a rain check. My roommate is really sick.

194

<5-19,Rachel>再见
<5-19,Rachel>Okay. Bye!

195
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,810
<5-19,Rachel>亲爱的  听着

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,850
<5-20,Monica>我可以跟你谈谈吗
<5-20,Monica>Could I talk to you just for a minute?

199
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,270
<5-20,Monica>我掉了几只袜子
<5-20,Monica>I dropped some socks.

<5-21,Rachel>好的
<5-21,Rachel>Yeah.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,870
<5-22,Monica>你哪根筋不对  你又想自找苦吃吗
<5-22,Monica>What is the matter with you? Do you want to fall into the trap?

202
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,660
<5-22,Monica>你又想自找苦吃吗
<5-22,Monica>Do you want to fall into the trap?

203
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,700
<5-23,Rachel>你根本没掉袜子
<5-23,Rachel>You did not drop any socks!

204
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,200
<5-24,Monica>我刚碰到大卫  他说你打发他走
<5-24,Monica>I just run into Dave, and he told me you blew him off!

205

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,300
<5-24,Monica>这里由我当家
<5-24,Monica>I'm calling the shots!

207
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,580
<5-24,Monica>我要你离开罗斯去追大卫
<5-24,Monica>I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave.

208
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,470
<5-24,Monica>你到底想怎么样
<5-24,Monica>What the hell are you trying to do?

209
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,080
<5-25,Rachel>其实我想  我打算
<5-25,Rachel>Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted...

210
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,540
<5-25,Rachel>告诉他我还爱他
<5-25,Rachel>...to tell him that I'm still in love with him.

211
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,920
<5-26,Monica>什么  你不能说
<5-26,Monica>What? You cannot tell him that!

212
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,810

<5-27,Rachel>People love to hear that!

214

<5-28,Monica>这里由我做决定  我不准你说
<5-28,Monica>I make the decisions and I say no!

215
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,450
<5-29,Rachel>知道吗  你不能帮我做决定  因为
<5-29,Rachel>You know what? No, you don't make my decisions, because...

216
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,130
<5-29,Rachel>你被解雇了
<5-29,Rachel>...you're fired.

217
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,160
<5-30,Monica>你不能解雇我
<5-30,Monica>You can't fire me.

218
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,170
<5-30,Monica>你的事情由我来决定
<5-30,Monica>I make your decisions,

219

<5-30,Monica>我决定  我没被解雇
<5-30,Monica>and I say I'm not fired! Ha!

220
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,330
<5-31,Rachel>既然如此

222
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,790
<5-33,Joey>有麻烦吗

223
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,320
<5-34,Monica>瑞秋把我锁在门外
<5-34,Monica>Rachel locked the door.

224
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,560
<5-35,Joey>你肯亲我  我就帮你撞开
<5-35,Joey>I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.

225
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,480
<6-1,Monica>瑞秋  开门
<6-1,Monica>Rachel, let me in.

226
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,990
<6-1,Monica>谢谢
<6-1,Monica>Thank you.

227
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,500
<6-1,Monica>瑞秋  我们出去谈谈好吗
<6-1,Monica>Rachel? Can I talk to you outside for a sec?

228
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
<7-1,Monica>不好
<7-1,Monica>No.

229
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,030
<7-2,Rachel>我真的有话要跟你说
<7-2,Rachel>I really need to talk to you.

230
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,710
<7-3,Monica>那就说啊
<7-3,Monica>Well, then talk.

231
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,940
<7-4,Rachel>那我就说了
<7-4,Rachel>Okay, I will.

232
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,700
<7-5,Monica>记得我们刚才讨论的  你要做的事吗
<7-5,Monica>Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?

233
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,610
<7-6,Rachel>-记得  -什么事
<7-6,Rachel>- Yes. - What thing?

234
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,330
<7-7,Ross>是这样
<7-7,Ross>Well...

235
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,730
<7-8,Monica>瑞秋要去上摇摆舞班
<7-8,Monica>Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.

236
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,930
<7-8,Monica>我觉得是个蠢主意
<7-8,Monica>Which I think is a really stupid idea.

237
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
<7-8,Monica>很危险  她的目的永远达不到
<7-8,Monica>It's dangerous. She's never going to get what she wants.

238
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,500
<7-8,Monica>而且搞不好她还会伤到人
<7-8,Monica>And who knows who she might end up hurting?

239
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,240
<7-9,Ross>莫妮卡说得对  摇摆舞是有点危险
<7-9,Ross>Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.

240
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,710
<7-9,Ross>我要打个电话
<7-9,Ross>I'm gonna use the phone.

241
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,920
<7-9,Ross>取消五只送给艾蜜莉的熊宝宝
<7-9,Ross>I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.

242
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,590
<7-9,Ross>否则熊宝宝难逃死劫
<7-9,Ross>My God! Think of the massacre.

243
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,850
<7-10,Rachel>我就是要说
<7-10,Rachel>I'm gonna do it.

244
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,890
<7-11,Monica>瑞秋  我知道你认为我疯了
<7-11,Monica>Rachel, okay. I know you think I'm crazy.

245
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,920
<7-11,Monica>但是在你告诉他之前
<7-11,Monica>Please before you tell him you love him,

246
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,220
<7-11,Monica>至少找到一个
<7-11,Monica>just try to find one person...

247
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,760
<7-11,Monica>支持你的人  我打赌你找不到

313
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,270
<9-26,Rachel>虽然大家都叫我别说

314
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,370
<9-26,Rachel>但我觉得他们都错了  是人就会犯错
<9-26,Rachel>But I think they're wrong. You know how people can be wrong.

<9-28,Rachel>罗斯  我说正经的
<9-28,Rachel>Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.

<9-32,Rachel>我这就说了
<9-32,Rachel>I think I'm just going to say it.

320
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,330
<9-32,Rachel>现在就告诉你
<9-32,Rachel>I'm just going to say it.

<9-32,Rachel>我还爱着你  罗斯
<9-32,Rachel>I'm still in love with you, Ross.

323
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,570
<9-34,Ross>怎么了  你跟我开玩笑吗  那就太恶劣了
<9-34,Ross>What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.

324
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,470
<9-35,Rachel>我很正经
<9-35,Rachel>I'm so dead serious!

325
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,610
<9-35,Rachel>不能再正经了
<9-35,Rachel>I'm totally serious!

326
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,110
<9-36,Ross>那你笑什么
<9-36,Ross>Why are you laughing?

327
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,750
<9-37,Rachel>因为我刚听到自己的话
<9-37,Rachel>Because I just heard it!

328
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,020
<9-37,Rachel>我听到了  而且觉得很荒谬
<9-37,Rachel>I heard it. And it's ridiculous!

329
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,380
<9-42,Ross>我是说
<9-42,Ross>I mean...

330
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,850
<9-43,Rachel>你已经结婚了
<9-43,Rachel>You're married!

331
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,560
<9-37,Rachel>你结婚了  太荒谬了  就像...
<9-37,Rachel>You're married, and it's just ridiculous! It's like...

332
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,300
<9-37,Rachel>我说话的时候  似乎灵魂出窍了
<9-37,Rachel>When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.

333
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,330
<9-37,Rachel>然后我的灵魂听到肉身说话
<9-37,Rachel>And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...

334
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,470
<9-37,Rachel>灵魂认为自己实在很白痴
<9-37,Rachel>I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

335
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,080
<9-38,Ross>-我的确已经结婚了  -我知道
<9-38,Ross>- Well, I am married. - I know.

336
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,880
<9-38,Ross>虽然婚礼后就没跟老婆说过话
<9-38,Ross>Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.

337
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,590
<9-39,Rachel>抱歉  这不好笑
<9-39,Rachel>I'm sorry. That's not funny.

338
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,050
<9-40,Ross>其实还蛮好笑的
<9-40,Ross>Actually, it kind of is.

339
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,860
<9-40,Ross>我老婆不回我电话
<9-40,Ross>My wife won't return my calls.

340
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,430
<9-40,Ross>我不知道我老婆在哪里
<9-40,Ross>I don't know where my wife is.

341
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,870
<9-40,Ross>"罗斯  你老婆呢"  我也不知道
<9-40,Ross>"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?" "Don't know!"

342
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,480
<9-40,Ross>天啊
<9-40,Ross>Oh, God!

343
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
<9-41,Rachel>好了
<9-41,Rachel>Okay.

344
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,160
<9-41,Rachel>你觉得你可以
<9-41,Rachel>You know what? Do you think...

345
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,620
<9-41,Rachel>忘记我刚说的话吗
<9-41,Rachel>Do you think you could just forget that I told you this?

346
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,360
<9-41,Rachel>我不忘记也不行
<9-41,Rachel>Well, I kind of have to.

347
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,430
<9-42,Ross>因为事实是
<9-42,Ross>I mean because the thing is...

348
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,400
<9-43,Rachel>事实就是你已经娶了艾蜜莉
<9-43,Rachel>The thing is, you know, that you're married to Emily.

349
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,170
<9-44,Ross>事实正是如此
<9-44,Ross>That is what the thing is.

350
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,040
<9-44,Ross>天啊
<9-44,Ross>Oh, God.

351

<9-45,Rachel>罗斯  我们还是好朋友吧
<9-45,Rachel>Ross, things won't be weird between us, right?

352
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,570
<9-45,Rachel>我说自己还爱你  真是太蠢了
<9-45,Rachel>I mean it was such a stupid thing me telling you that?

353
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,120
<9-46,Ross>不会  我很高兴你告诉我
<9-46,Ross>No, no! I'm glad you did.

354

<9-46,Ross>总之听到有人说爱你都会很开心的
