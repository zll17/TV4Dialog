<6-39,MONICA>Look, when it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...

180
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,430
<6-39,MONICA>因为她是我哥哥的女友
<6-39,MONICA>... because she was my brother's girlfriend.

181
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,280
<6-39,MONICA>然后就顺理成章
<6-39,MONICA>And then one thing led to another...

182
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,880
<6-39,MONICA>在我搞明白之前  我们就
<6-39,MONICA>...and before I knew it, we were...

183
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,350
<6-39,MONICA>逛街了
<6-39,MONICA>...shopping.

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,770
<6-40,RACHEL>我的天
<6-40,RACHEL>Oh, my God.

<6-41,MONICA>等等  我们只做了一次
<6-41,MONICA>Wait, we only did it once.

186
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,690
<6-41,MONICA>对我没有任何意义
<6-41,MONICA>It didn't meant anything to me.

187
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,060
<6-42,RACHEL>好吧
<6-42,RACHEL>Right. Sure.

188
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,460
<6-43,MONICA>瑞秋  我惦记的一直都是你
<6-43,MONICA>Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.

189
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,490
<6-43,MONICA>对不起  好吗  我不希望你知道的
<6-43,MONICA>Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.

191
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,050
<6-45,MONICA>不是这样的
<6-45,MONICA>That is not true.

192
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,610
<6-46,RACHEL>所以你不小心留收据在这里
<6-46,RACHEL>So you just happened to leave it in here?

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
<6-47,MONICA>你觉得我会这么笨吗
<6-47,MONICA>Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?

194
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,560
<6-48,RACHEL>好  我必须知道一件事
<6-48,RACHEL>Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing.

<6-49,MONICA>Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.

<6-49,MONICA>我知道我做了错事
<6-49,MONICA>Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

201
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,230
<6-49,MONICA>琼安  事情没这么简单  好吗
<6-49,MONICA>Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, okay?

<6-49,MONICA>不  我才不在乎史蒂夫怎么想  你好  史蒂夫
<6-49,MONICA>No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.

203
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,070
<6-50,CAROL>情况如何
<6-50,CAROL>How did we do?

204
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,030
<6-51,PHOEBE>我尝了本的奶  罗斯就发火了
<6-51,PHOEBE>I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.

205
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,300
<6-52,ROSS>我没有发火
<6-52,ROSS>I did not freak out.

206
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,850
<6-53,CAROL>-你为什么发火  -因为那是母乳
<6-53,CAROL>- Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk.

207
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,720
<6-54,ROSS>很呕心
<6-54,ROSS>It's gross.

208
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,060
<6-55,CAROL>我的奶水很呕心
<6-55,CAROL>My breast milk is gross?

209
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,000
<6-56,SUSAN>有好戏看了
<6-56,SUSAN>This should be fun.

210
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,740
<6-57,ROSS>这没什么不对
<6-57,ROSS>No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.

211
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,980
<6-57,ROSS>我只是不认为母乳是给大人喝的
<6-57,ROSS>I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

212
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,980
<6-58,CHANDLER>当然装母乳的容器很吸引大人与小孩
<6-58,CHANDLER>Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.

213
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,280
<6-59,CAROL>罗斯  别傻了  我试过  没什么
<6-59,CAROL>Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal.

214
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,740
<6-59,CAROL>快尝尝
<6-59,CAROL>Come on. Just taste it.

215
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,130
<6-60,ROSS>不行
<6-60,ROSS>That would be no.

216
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,310
<6-61,PHOEBE>-尝尝吧  很天然  -试试  -不
<6-61,PHOEBE>- Come on. It's natural. - Try it. - No.

217
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,630
<6-61,PHOEBE>又不难吃
<6-61,PHOEBE>It doesn't taste bad.

218
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,270
<6-46,RACHEL>有一点甜  很像...
<6-46,RACHEL>Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like....

219
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,930
<6-63,SUSAN>-像什么  -哈密瓜汁
<6-63,SUSAN>- Like what? - Cantaloupe juice.

220
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,910
<6-64,JOEY>没错
<6-64,JOEY>Exactly.

221
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,650
<6-65,ROSS>你尝过了
<6-65,ROSS>You've tasted it.

222
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,600
<6-65,ROSS>你尝过了
<6-65,ROSS>You've tasted it.

223
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,960
<6-67,ROSS>你尝过了
<6-67,ROSS>Oh, you've tasted it.

224
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,770
<6-68,SUSAN>你再怎么重复这句话  也不会改变事实
<6-68,SUSAN>You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

225
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,370
<6-69,ROSS>把奶瓶给我
<6-69,ROSS>Give me the bottle.

226
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,640
<6-69,ROSS>把毛巾给我
<6-69,ROSS>Get me the towel.

227
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,920
<6-70,CHANDLER>你好
<6-70,CHANDLER>Howdy.

228
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,810
<6-71,JOEY>给我一盒果汁
<6-71,JOEY>Give me a box of juice.

229
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,170
<6-71,JOEY>他们把我调到原野奇侠了
<6-71,JOEY>Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

230
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,780
<6-72,CHANDLER>也许是因为你的穿着
<6-72,CHANDLER>Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

231
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,300
<6-73,JOEY>或因为那家伙表现太好了
<6-73,JOEY>Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good

232
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,100
<6-73,JOEY>他们要增加人手
<6-73,JOEY>they wanna put more people on it.

233
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,270
<6-73,JOEY>你该见识一下  钱德勒  那家伙一天用掉两瓶
<6-73,JOEY>You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.

234
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,870
<6-74,CHANDLER>你在乎什么
<6-74,CHANDLER>What do you care?

235
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,600
<6-74,CHANDLER>你是个演员  这只是你的副业
<6-74,CHANDLER>You're an actor. This is your day job.

236
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,380
<6-74,CHANDLER>对你来说毫无意义
<6-74,CHANDLER>This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.

237
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,650
<6-75,JOEY>我知道  但我本来是最棒的
<6-75,JOEY>I know, but I was the best.

238
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
<6-75,JOEY>我喜欢当最棒的
<6-75,JOEY>You know? I liked being the best.

239
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,430
<6-75,JOEY>也许我应该退出江湖
<6-75,JOEY>I don't know.Maybe I should get out of the game.

240
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,050
<6-75,JOEY>厨具部门需要有人切乳酪
<6-75,JOEY>They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

241
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,040
<6-76,CHANDLER>假如你这么做了
<6-76,CHANDLER>Say you do that.

242
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,290
<6-76,CHANDLER>迟早会有乳酪切得比你好的人出现
<6-76,CHANDLER>Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.

243
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,590
<6-76,CHANDLER>那时候你要逃到哪里
<6-76,CHANDLER>Then where you gonna run?

244
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,840
<6-77,JOEY>也许你说得对
<6-77,JOEY>Yeah. I guess you're right.

245
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,940
<6-78,CHANDLER>我说的当然对了
<6-78,CHANDLER>You're damn right I'm right.

246

<6-88,RACHEL>她偷走我的男人已经够糟了
<6-88,RACHEL>It's bad enough she stole the guy...
