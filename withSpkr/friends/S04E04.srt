149
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,580
<9-6,Phoebe>因为臀部的肌肉
<9-6,Phoebe>Because the muscles in the sciatic area can get...

<9-6,Phoebe>紧实有弹性
<9-6,Phoebe>...real nice and tight.

<10-3,MrTreeger>那你要我把你们赶走
<10-3,MrTreeger>You want me to kick you guys out instead?

<10-7,MrTreeger>我还以为是反过来
<10-7,MrTreeger>Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.

161
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,650
<10-8,Joey>拜托  让她们留下来
<10-8,Joey>Come on man, just-just let the girls stay,

<11-3,Rachel>那怎么不找女生练
<11-3,Rachel>why doesn't he practice with a girl?

173
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,010
<11-4,Joey>他不好意思
<11-4,Joey>Well, he's too shy,

174
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,210
<11-4,Joey>他觉得他还没资格跟女生跳
<11-4,Joey>he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.

175
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,410
<11-5,Rachel>是的
<11-5,Rachel>Yeah, right.

<11-5,Rachel>他差点害我跳进那个垃圾槽里

<11-6,Monica>别再念了  你又没事
<11-6,Monica>Would you let it go already? you're fine.

<11-8,Rachel>你退出了
<11-8,Rachel>So did you quit?

179
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,040
<11-9,Chandler>差一点
<11-9,Chandler>I almost did.

180
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,640
<11-9,Chandler>但我不能丢下罗斯不管
<11-9,Chandler>Couldn't leave ross there without a spotter.

181
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,110
<11-10,Monica>你加入会员了
<11-10,Monica>Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

182
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,080
<11-11,Ross>是很好笑  为什么
<11-11,Ross>And that's funny, why?

183
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,760
<11-12,Rachel>我只是在想像你在健身和
<11-12,Rachel>I was just, you know, picturing you working out, and....

184
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,080
<11-12,Rachel>就这样
<11-12,Rachel>Well, that's it.

185
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,030
<11-13,Chandler>我们毁了
<11-13,Chandler>We're doomed.

186
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,460
<11-13,Chandler>我们下半辈子
<11-13,Chandler>They'll take $50 a month from our

187
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,790
<11-13,Chandler>每个月都会白白扣掉50元
<11-13,Chandler>accounts for the rest of our lives.

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,060
<11-13,Chandler>我们该怎么办
<11-13,Chandler>What are we gonna do?

189
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,970
<11-14,Monica>你们可以真的去健身
<11-14,Monica>You could actually go to the gym.

190
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,780
<11-15,Ross>或者去银行
<11-15,Ross>Or we could go to the bank...

191
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,880
<11-15,Ross>取消户头  断了他们的财路
<11-15,Ross>...close our accounts and cut them off at the source.

192
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,950
<11-16,Chandler>你太有才了
<11-16,Chandler>You're a genius.

193
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,460
<11-17,Joey>那我们就不能当银行好兄弟了
<11-17,Joey>Oh, man! but then, we won't be bank buddies.

194
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,830
<11-18,Chandler>现在又多了一个理由
<11-18,Chandler>Now there's two reasons.

195
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,470
<11-20,All>记得我说的那个帅哥客人
<11-20,All>You guys, remember that cute client i told you about?

196
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,800
<11-21,Phoebe>我咬了他
<11-21,Phoebe>I bit him.

197
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,840
<11-23,Phoebe>-咬哪里  -屁屁
<11-23,Phoebe>-where? -on the tushy.

198
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,210
<11-24,Ross>这样就不违反你的誓约
<11-24,Ross>And that's not against your oath?

199
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,880
<11-25,Phoebe>我知道  对不起  但是一摸到他
<11-25,Phoebe>I know, but the moment i touch him...

200
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,130
<11-25,Phoebe>我就想抛开旧誓约
<11-25,Phoebe>...i want to throw out my old

201
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,320
<11-25,Phoebe>来一个非限制级的
<11-25,Phoebe>and take a new, dirty one.

202
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,220
<11-26,Monica>下次你再按摩的时候  就让自己分心
<11-26,Monica>Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.

203
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,930
<11-27,Joey>对  像我如果在做很兴奋的事
<11-27,Joey>Like when i'm doing something exciting...

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,060
<11-27,Joey>又不想太
<11-27,Joey>...and i don't want to get too...

205
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,770
<11-27,Joey>兴奋
<11-27,Joey>...excited.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,800
<11-27,Joey>我就会想别的事  像三明治
<11-27,Joey>I try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches,

207
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,840
<11-27,Joey>棒球
<11-27,Joey>...and baseball...

208
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,400
<11-27,Joey>还有钱德勒
<11-27,Joey>and ah Chandler!

209
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,610
<11-29,Joey>-谢谢你  乔伊  -不  谢谢你
<11-29,Joey>-thank you. -oh, no, thank you.

210
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,880
<12-1,Joey>我来了  咱们速战速决
<12-1,Joey>All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with.

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,120
<12-2,MrTreeger>跟着我的舞步
<12-2,MrTreeger>...just follow my lead.

213
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,360
<12-3,Joey>不必先做点准备
<12-3,Joey>Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?

214
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,760
<12-3,Joey>像是喝个烂醉
<12-3,Joey>Like get really drunk?

215
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,630
<12-4,MrTreeger>来  抱着我
<12-4,MrTreeger>Come on. hey, just put your arms around me.

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,810
<2-12,Rachel>对不起
<2-12,Rachel>I'm sorry.

217
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,080
<12-5,MrTreeger>没关系  如果我是玛姬
<12-5,MrTreeger>No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge,

218
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,280
<12-6,Joey>我的胸会被撞到背后去
<12-6,Joey>...my breasts are coming out my back.

219
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,260
<12-7,MrTreeger>算了  我根本不会跳舞
<12-7,MrTreeger>Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this,

220
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,850
<12-7,MrTreeger>我妈说得对
<12-7,MrTreeger>My mom was right.

221
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,330
<12-7,MrTreeger>我只是穿了衣服的大猪公
<12-7,MrTreeger>I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.

222
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,060
<12-8,Joey>别这样  你不是猪公
<12-8,Joey>Come on man, you're not a potato.

223
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,670
<12-9,MrTreeger>总之我不适合跳舞
<12-9,MrTreeger>I'm sure as hell a dancer,it's no use

224
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,430
<12-9,MrTreeger>玛姬不会看上我的
<12-9,MrTreeger>Marge will never go for me.

225
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,100
<12-10,Joey>别这么说  你只是
<12-10,Joey>Come on, treeger. don't say that.

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,140
<12-10,Joey>只是需要练习
<12-10,Joey>You just need more practice.

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,550
<12-10,Joey>而且就算有问题  也八成在我身上
<12-10,Joey>Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.

229
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,350
<12-10,Joey>我不太习惯跟一个
<12-10,Joey>I'm not that comfortable dancing with a

230
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,890
<13-1,Monica>舞练得怎样  有同志情谊了
<13-1,Monica>So how goes the dancing? gay yet?

231
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,970
<13-2,Joey>你们欠我一个人情
<13-2,Joey>You guys owe me bigtime.

232
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,380
<13-3,Rachel>那是什么
<13-3,Rachel>What was that?

233
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,780
<13-5,Rachel>你刚才在跳舞
<13-5,Rachel>You just did a little dancy thing.

<13-9,Joey>No, i'm not.

237
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,150
<13-9,Joey>而且那不是跳  那叫滑走步
<13-9,Joey>And it wasn't a hop. it was a pas de bourree.

238
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,400
<13-10,Monica>你还知道术语
<13-10,Monica>You know the words!
