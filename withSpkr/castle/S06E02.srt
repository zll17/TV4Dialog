41
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,620
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>那解药呢  肯定有解药的
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>What about an antidote? There has to be an antidote.

42
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,250
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>仅存的那瓶解药和毒剂一起被盗了
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>The only existing vial was stolen with the toxin.

43
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,040
<1-3,CASTLE>他们还能生产更多  对吧
<1-3,CASTLE>They can make more, right?

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,200
<1-3,CASTLE>他们肯定能生产更多
<1-3,CASTLE>They have to be able to make more.

45
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,920
<1-4,BECKETT>需要很长的时间才能合成
<1-4,BECKETT>It would take too long to synthesize.

46
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,720
<1-5,CASTLE>-多长的时间  -一周
<1-5,CASTLE>- How long? - A week.

47
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,870
<1-4,BECKETT>太长了
<1-4,BECKETT>That's too long.

48
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,250
<1-7,CASTLE>你确定我中毒了吗  我是说  我
<1-7,CASTLE>Are you sure I was exposed? I mean, I--

49
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,020
<1-7,CASTLE>我觉得没事  也许他们搞错了
<1-7,CASTLE>I feel fine. Maybe they were... wrong.

50
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,380
<1-8,BECKETT>沃特·里德医院派来了一名医生
<1-8,BECKETT>Look, there's a doctor coming in from Walter Reed.

51
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,350
<1-8,BECKETT>他会回答你提出的
<1-8,BECKETT>He's gonna be able to answer any other questions

52
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,660
<1-8,BECKETT>别的问题
<1-8,BECKETT>that you might have.

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,730
<1-9,CASTLE>你已经回答了
<1-9,CASTLE>Yeah, well, I think you already did that.

54
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,300
<1-9,CASTLE>别消沉
<1-9,CASTLE>Hey.

55
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,770
<1-10,BECKETT>我们会找到幕后黑手
<1-10,BECKETT>We're gonna find whoever's behind this.

56
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,130
<1-10,BECKETT>找到后  我们会拿到解药
<1-10,BECKETT>And when we do, we're gonna get that antidote,

57
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,200
<1-10,BECKETT>因为我不会让你这么轻易就抛下我这个未婚妻
<1-10,BECKETT>'cause I'm not letting you out of our engagement that easily.

58
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,510
<1-11,CASTLE>好吧
<1-11,CASTLE>All right.

59
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,650
<1-11,CASTLE>你们调查得怎么样了
<1-11,CASTLE>So where are you in the investigation?

60
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,150
<1-12,BECKETT>我们在调查一切可能的线索
<1-12,BECKETT>We're looking into every possible lead.

61
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,090
<1-13,CASTLE>你们毫无进展时就会这样说
<1-13,CASTLE>That's what you say when you're nowhere.

62
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,840
<1-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<1-14,BECKETT>Castle--

63
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,040
<1-15,CASTLE>绑架我的人
<1-15,CASTLE>The guy who abducted me--

64
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,660
<1-16,BECKETT>-布朗森  -对
<1-16,BECKETT>- Yeah. Bronson. - Right.

65
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,490
<1-17,CASTLE>他是军方的人  还是特工
<1-17,CASTLE>Was he military? Special ops?

66
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,950
<1-18,BECKETT>海军陆战队侦察队的  怎么了
<1-18,BECKETT>Marine force recon. Why?

67
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,490
<1-19,CASTLE>在他临终前  他说了几句话
<1-19,CASTLE>Okay, because before he died, he said something.

68
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,280
<1-20,BECKETT>瓦尔基里  我们在调查
<1-20,BECKETT>Valkyrie. Yeah. We've been looking into it.

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,530
<1-20,BECKETT>-但数据库里没有相关资料  -不是那个
<1-20,BECKETT>- There's nothing in the databases. - Not that.

70
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,310
<1-20,BECKETT>他说的是梦乡
<1-20,BECKETT>He said something about dreamworld.

71
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,240
<1-21,CASTLE>开始我以为那是随口乱说的
<1-21,CASTLE>Now I didn't think it was anything,

72
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,990
<1-21,CASTLE>但根据埃斯波西托的说法
<1-21,CASTLE>but according to Esposito,

73
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,580
<1-21,CASTLE>梦乡是位于中东地区的特别行动
<1-21,CASTLE>"Dreamworld" is the code name of a special ops ghost base

74
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,680
<1-21,CASTLE>幽灵基地的代号
<1-21,CASTLE>somewhere in the Middle East.

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,320
<1-22,BECKETT>你觉得那和盗窃毒剂的人
<1-22,BECKETT>And you think that that somehow relates

76
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,760
<1-22,BECKETT>有关系
<1-22,BECKETT>to the theft of the toxin?

77
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,780
<1-23,CASTLE>我觉得布朗森认为有关
<1-23,CASTLE>I... think Bronson thought it did.

78
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,800
<1-24,DOCTOR GOLDBERG>抱歉打扰了
<1-24,DOCTOR GOLDBERG>Sorry to interrupt.

79
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,980
<1-24,DOCTOR GOLDBERG>我是戈德伯格医生  来为卡塞尔先生做检查
<1-24,DOCTOR GOLDBERG>I'm Dr. Goldberg, here to check on Mr. Castle.

80
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,040
<2-1,RACHEL MCCORD>他怎么样
<2-1,RACHEL MCCORD>How's he doing?

81
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,540
<2-2,BECKETT>比我好  调查得怎么样了
<2-2,BECKETT>Better than I am. Where are we?

82
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,970
<2-3,MCCORD>我们现在知道幕后黑手
<2-3,MCCORD>Well, we know whoever's behind this

83
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,450
<2-3,MCCORD>陷害了杰克·布朗森非法闯入
<2-3,MCCORD>framed Jack Bronson for the break-in

84
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,010
<2-3,MCCORD>然后使用毒剂杀了他
<2-3,MCCORD>and then used the toxin to kill him.

85
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,280
<2-4,BECKETT>也就是说他们得和他有交集
<2-4,BECKETT>Which means they would have had to have crossed paths with him

86
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,060
<2-4,BECKETT>-才能做到这一切  -正是
<2-4,BECKETT>- in order to deliver it. - Exactly.

87
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,740
<2-5,MCCORD>亨德里克斯和他的小队在回顾
<2-5,MCCORD>Hendricks and his team are retracing

88
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,340
<2-5,MCCORD>布朗森的一举一动  来查明人物和时间
<2-5,MCCORD>all of Bronson's movements to get a who and a when.

89
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,100
<2-5,MCCORD>这是大海捞针  但也许我们会走运
<2-5,MCCORD>It's a needle in a haystack, but maybe we'll get lucky.

90
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,770
<2-6,BECKETT>-查到瓦尔基里了吗  -没有和这事有联系的
<2-6,BECKETT>- Anything on Valkyrie? - Nothing that connects.

91
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,910
<2-7,MCCORD>但是分析员仍在查找
<2-7,MCCORD>Analysts are still working on it, though.

92
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,280
<2-8,BECKETT>你听过叫"梦乡"的东西吗
<2-8,BECKETT>Have you ever heard of something called dreamworld?

93
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,810
<2-9,MCCORD>梦乡是什么
<2-9,MCCORD>What's dreamworld?

94
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,850
<3-1,GOLDBERG>磷定和阿托品
<3-1,GOLDBERG>The pralidoxime and atropine

95
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,240
<3-1,GOLDBERG>会延缓毒效
<3-1,GOLDBERG>will stave off the effect of the toxin

96
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,520
<3-1,GOLDBERG>给你争取到更多时间
<3-1,GOLDBERG>and buy you some more time.

97
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,560
<3-2,CASTLE>多少时间
<3-2,CASTLE>How much more?

98
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,060
<3-3,GOLDBERG>一小时  也许两小时
<3-3,GOLDBERG>An hour, maybe two.

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,630
<3-3,GOLDBERG>每四小时我会给你注射一剂
<3-3,GOLDBERG>I'll give you another shot every four hours,

100
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,570
<3-3,GOLDBERG>但最终药剂会失效
<3-3,GOLDBERG>but eventually it won't be effective.

101
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,640
<3-4,CASTLE>那时候会怎样
<3-4,CASTLE>And then what?

102
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,900
<3-5,GOLDBERG>临终之时  你会觉得虚弱无力
<3-5,GOLDBERG>Towards the end, you'll start to feel weak,

103
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,880
<3-5,GOLDBERG>呼吸急促
<3-5,GOLDBERG>experience shortness of breath.

104
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,360
<3-6,CASTLE>为什么布朗森那么快就死了  而我还活着
<3-6,CASTLE>Why did Bronson die so quickly, and I'm still alive?

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
<3-7,GOLDBERG>布朗森在车里待了好几个小时
<3-7,GOLDBERG>Bronson was in the car for hours,

106
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,400
<3-7,GOLDBERG>所以他吸收了大部分毒剂
<3-7,GOLDBERG>so he got the mother lode.

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,610
<3-7,GOLDBERG>你在车里才待了几分钟
<3-7,GOLDBERG>You were in the car just for a few minutes.

108
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,110
<3-7,GOLDBERG>如果以液体形式摄入  你几秒钟就会死
<3-7,GOLDBERG>Ingested in liquid form, you go down in seconds,

109
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,790
<3-7,GOLDBERG>但基于你的血液检查
<3-7,GOLDBERG>but based on your blood work,

110
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,860
<3-7,GOLDBERG>你至少还能活10到12小时
<3-7,GOLDBERG>you have at least another 10 to 12 hours.

111
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,640
<3-8,CASTLE>那么
<3-8,CASTLE>So then...

112
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,480
<3-8,CASTLE>除开我即将死去的事实  我还好
<3-8,CASTLE>apart from the fact that I'm dying, I'm fine?

113
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,750
<3-9,GOLDBERG>你现在还没出现症状
<3-9,GOLDBERG>You're asymptomatic.

114
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,690
<3-9,GOLDBERG>我会尽量让你保持这样的
<3-9,GOLDBERG>I'll try to keep you that way for as long as possible.

115
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,230
<4-1,CHIEF CARL VILANTE>中东地区的幽灵基地
<4-1,CHIEF CARL VILANTE>A ghost base in the Middle East?

116
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,480
<4-2,BECKETT>我知道希望渺茫
<4-2,BECKETT>Look, I know this is a long shot,

117
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,780
<4-2,BECKETT>但是布朗森也许是想传递信息
<4-2,BECKETT>but Bronson may have been trying to communicate a message.

118
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,070
<4-3,MCCORD>或者是临死之人的胡言乱语
<4-3,MCCORD>Or it's just the ramblings of a dying man.

119
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,630
<4-3,MCCORD>我们查看过政府
<4-3,MCCORD>Look, we checked the government

120
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,940
<4-3,MCCORD>和军方的数据库
<4-3,MCCORD>and military databases.

121
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,290
<4-3,MCCORD>官方没有提及过梦乡
<4-3,MCCORD>There's no official reference to dreamworld--

122
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,170
<4-3,MCCORD>还不知道它存不存在呢
<4-3,MCCORD>If it even exists.

123
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,960
<4-4,AGENT RICHMOND>我觉得它存在
<4-4,AGENT RICHMOND>Uh, I think it exists.

124
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,710
<4-5,VILANTE>你查到了什么
<4-5,VILANTE>What did you find?

125
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,140
<4-6,RICHMOND>五角大楼的档案文件里找到关键词
<4-6,RICHMOND>A name just popped in a Pentagon archive.

126
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,560
<4-6,RICHMOND>布拉德·帕克  《华盛顿联盟》的记者
<4-6,RICHMOND>Brad Parker, a reporter for "The Washington Union".

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,300
<4-7,VILANTE>记者和这有什么关系
<4-7,VILANTE>What's a reporter got to do with this?

128
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,620
<4-8,RICHMOND>六个月前他试图发表一篇
<4-8,RICHMOND>Six months ago he tried to publish an article

129
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,980
<4-8,RICHMOND>名为《揭秘梦乡》的文章
<4-8,RICHMOND>called "Inside dreamworld",

130
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,150
<4-8,RICHMOND>出于国家安全考虑  文章被封杀了
<4-8,RICHMOND>but it was quashed over national security concerns.

131
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,750
<4-9,BECKETT>内容是什么
<4-9,BECKETT>What does the article say?

132
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,160
<4-10,RICHMOND>我拿不到原文  内容被加密了
<4-10,RICHMOND>I don't have the text. They've classified it.

133
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,370
<4-10,RICHMOND>只能看到标题
<4-10,RICHMOND>I have the title.

134
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,220
<4-11,VILANTE>我去联系五角大楼的熟人
<4-11,VILANTE>I'll call my contact at the pentagon

135
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,640
<4-11,VILANTE>看看他能查到什么
<4-11,VILANTE>and see what he can dig up.

136
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,530
<4-11,VILANTE>与此同时  找到这名记者
<4-11,VILANTE>In the meanwhile, track down this reporter.

137
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,740
<4-11,VILANTE>看他知道些什么
<4-11,VILANTE>Find out what he knows.

138
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,590
<4-12,CASTLE>你可以查一下布朗森的通话记录
<4-12,CASTLE>You could also check Bronson's phone records.

139
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,160
<4-12,CASTLE>他和这名记者可能联系过
<4-12,CASTLE>He and this reporter might be connected.

140
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,700
<4-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你该去休息
<4-13,BECKETT>Castle, you should be resting.

141
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,120
<4-14,CASTLE>很明显...以后有的是时间休息
<4-14,CASTLE>There's plenty of time for that later... apparently.

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
<4-14,CASTLE>如果结局不能改变  我宁愿来帮忙
<4-14,CASTLE>Um, if it's all the same, I'd rather be helping.

143
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,500
<4-15,VILANTE>卡塞尔先生  我知道你想帮忙  但是
<4-15,VILANTE>Mr. Castle, I understand your desire to be involved, but--

144
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,020
<4-16,CASTLE>没人比我更想侦破这个案子
<4-16,CASTLE>No one is more motivated than me to solve this,

145
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,940
<4-16,CASTLE>如果破不了案
<4-16,CASTLE>and if it doesn't work out,

146
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,620
<4-16,CASTLE>我就死掉了  不会再打扰你们
<4-16,CASTLE>I'll... be out of your hair by the end of the day.

147
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,450
<4-17,BECKETT>长官  卡塞尔是唯一
<4-17,BECKETT>Y-you know, sir, Castle is the only one

148
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,630
<4-17,BECKETT>与布朗森有亲身接触的人
<4-17,BECKETT>that has firsthand experience with Bronson.

149
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,230
<4-17,BECKETT>他也许能帮上忙
<4-17,BECKETT>He might be an asset.

150
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,920
<4-17,BECKETT>好吧
<4-17,BECKETT>Okay.

151
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,250
<4-18,VILANTE>贝克特探员  他由你负责
<4-18,VILANTE>But, Agent Beckett, he's your responsibility.

152
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,220
<4-19,BECKETT>好的
<4-19,BECKETT>I know.

153
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,790
<4-20,RICHMOND>长官  布朗森与这名记者联系过
<4-20,RICHMOND>Sir, it looks like Bronson and the reporter are connected.

154
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,790
<4-20,RICHMOND>他的通话记录显示
<4-20,RICHMOND>His phone records show calls to and from

155
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,260
<4-20,RICHMOND>在文章写就前后
<4-20,RICHMOND>"The Washington Union"

156
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,910
<4-20,RICHMOND>有来自《华盛顿联盟》的电话进出
<4-20,RICHMOND>around the time the article was written.

157
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,960
<4-21,MCCORD>布朗森一定是文章的线人之一
<4-21,MCCORD>Bronson must have been a source for the article.

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,230
<4-22,VILANTE>去  看看他知道些什么
<4-22,VILANTE>Go. Find out what he knows.

159
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,510
<4-22,VILANTE>卡塞尔先生
<4-22,VILANTE>Uh, Mr. Castle.

160

<4-23,VILANTE>你可以协助  但不能离开这栋楼
<4-23,VILANTE>You can assist us, but only from inside this building.

161
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,450
<4-24,CASTLE>好的
<4-24,CASTLE>Right. Mm.

162
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,250
<5-1,BECKETT>谢谢你在卡塞尔这件事上支持我
<5-1,BECKETT>Look, uh, thanks for backing me up with Castle.

163
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,960
<5-2,MCCORD>他总是那么有个性吗
<5-2,MCCORD>Was he always such a character?

164
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,430
<5-3,BECKETT>是啊  这也是我爱他的一个原因
<5-3,BECKETT>Yeah. It's one of the things that I love about him, too.

165
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,300
<5-4,MCCORD>来了
<5-4,MCCORD>There.

166
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,450
<5-4,MCCORD>帕克先生
<5-4,MCCORD>Mr. Parker!

167
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,680
<5-4,MCCORD>帕克先生  请留步
<5-4,MCCORD>Mr. Parker, excuse me.

168
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,190
<5-5,BECKETT>我们是司法部的探员
<5-5,BECKETT>We're from the attorney general's office.

169
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,440
<5-5,BECKETT>关于你写的《揭秘梦乡》这篇文章
<5-5,BECKETT>We need to ask you a few questions

170
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,030
<5-5,BECKETT>有几个问题想问你
<5-5,BECKETT>about an article you wrote-- "Inside dreamworld."

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,950
<5-6,BRAD PARKER>真的  还要问吗
<5-6,BRAD PARKER>Really? We're gonna do this again?

172
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,160
<5-6,BRAD PARKER>你们简直难以置信
<5-6,BRAD PARKER>You people are unbelievable.

173
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,210
<5-7,MCCORD>你说什么
<5-7,MCCORD>Excuse me?

174
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,510
<5-8,PARKER>你们封杀我的文章时我没公布我的线人
<5-8,PARKER>I wouldn't give up my sources when you killed the article,

175
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,870
<5-8,PARKER>现在我何必透露给你们
<5-8,PARKER>so why would I give them up now?

176
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,500
<5-9,BECKETT>因为其中一位被谋杀了
<5-9,BECKETT>Because it looks like one of your sources was murdered.

177
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,580
<5-10,MCCORD>你认识他吗  帕克先生
<5-10,MCCORD>Do you recognize him, Mr. Parker?

178
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,590
<5-10,MCCORD>布朗森
<5-10,MCCORD>Bronson.

179
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,390
<5-11,PARKER>他被杀了
<5-11,PARKER>He was murdered?

180
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,320
<5-12,BECKETT>是的  其他人的生命也面临威胁
<5-12,BECKETT>Yes, and now other people's lives are at stake.

181
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,350
<5-12,BECKETT>告诉我们关于梦乡你所知的一切
<5-12,BECKETT>Now tell us everything you know about dreamworld.

191
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,870
<6-1,PARKER>我第一次听说梦乡是在03年
<6-1,PARKER>First time I heard about dreamworld was in '03.

192
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,320
<6-1,PARKER>当时我在驻坎大哈173师服役
<6-1,PARKER>I was serving with the 173rd in Kandahar at the time.

193
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,240
<6-1,PARKER>我一直记得这个故事
<6-1,PARKER>The story stuck with me,

194
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,260
<6-1,PARKER>大约一年前我开始四处打探
<6-1,PARKER>so about a year ago I started poking around.

195
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,110
<6-1,PARKER>发现梦乡是个位于阿富汗北部的
<6-1,PARKER>Found out it was a forward operating base

196
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,660
<6-1,PARKER>前方作战基地
<6-1,PARKER>in northern Afghanistan,

197
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,250
<6-1,PARKER>是该区域开展机密特别行动的控制中心
<6-1,PARKER>launching pad for covert special ops in the region.

198
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,850
<6-2,BECKETT>布朗森在这个基地工作吗
<6-2,BECKETT>Did Bronson work at that base?

199
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,340
<6-2,BECKETT>是的
<6-2,BECKETT>Yeah.

200
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,230
<6-3,PARKER>我听过几次他的名字
<6-3,PARKER>Yeah, I'd heard his name a couple of times,

201
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,300
<6-3,PARKER>所以联系了他
<6-3,PARKER>so I approached him.

202
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,560
<6-4,MCCORD>他告诉你什么了
<6-4,MCCORD>And what'd he tell you?

203
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,120
<6-5,PARKER>什么也没说
<6-5,PARKER>Nothing at all.

204
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,320
<6-5,PARKER>事实上  他看上去很惊慌
<6-5,PARKER>In fact, he seemed pretty freaked out

205
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,010
<6-5,PARKER>得知我知道他曾在梦乡驻扎
<6-5,PARKER>that I knew he was stationed there...

206
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,390
<6-5,PARKER>他问我知道多少
<6-5,PARKER>Asking me how much I knew...

207
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,910
<6-5,PARKER>关于他  梦乡
<6-5,PARKER>About him, dreamworld...

208
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,140
<6-5,PARKER>以及他做了什么
<6-5,PARKER>About what he'd done.

209
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,150
<6-6,BECKETT>等等  你什么意思
<6-6,BECKETT>Wait, what--what did he mean by that?

210
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,840
<6-7,PARKER>他从未提及
<6-7,PARKER>He never told me.

211
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,650
<6-7,PARKER>无论是什么
<6-7,PARKER>Whatever it was,

212
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,730
<6-7,PARKER>他肯定不想将它公开
<6-7,PARKER>he sure as hell didn't want it getting out.

213
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,800
<6-7,PARKER>然后我的主编得到了国防部长里德的
<6-7,PARKER>Next thing I know, my editor's killing the story...

214
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,890
<6-7,PARKER>个人请求  把我的文章封杀了
<6-7,PARKER>at the personal request of defense secretary Reed.

215
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,540
<6-8,BECKETT>在你与布朗森的谈话中
<6-8,BECKETT>These conversations that you had with Bronson--

216
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,270
<6-8,BECKETT>他提到过"瓦尔基里"吗
<6-8,BECKETT>Did he ever mention the word "Valkyrie"?

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
<6-9,PARKER>没有  怎么了  瓦尔基里是什么
<6-9,PARKER>No. Why? What's valkyrie?

218
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,430
<6-9,PARKER>等等
<6-9,PARKER>Wait.

219
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,410
<6-10,MCCORD>国防部长亲自打电话
<6-10,MCCORD>The secretary of defense himself

220
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,210
<6-10,MCCORD>要求封杀文章
<6-10,MCCORD>called to kill the story?

221
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,810
<6-10,MCCORD>真很不寻常
<6-10,MCCORD>That's unusual.

222
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,160
<6-11,PARKER>是前所未闻
<6-11,PARKER>Try unheard of.

223
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,420
<6-11,PARKER>我猜文章内容太过敏感
<6-11,PARKER>But I'm guessing that the subject matter struck a nerve.

224
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,220
<6-11,PARKER>在担任国防部长之前
<6-11,PARKER>Look, prior to his appointment as secretary of defense,

225
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,230
<6-11,PARKER>里德部长是总指挥官
<6-11,PARKER>General Reed was in charge of Central Command,

226
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,120
<6-11,PARKER>负责指挥梦乡的所有对外任务
<6-11,PARKER>which ran all missions out of dreamworld.

227
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,530
<6-12,BECKETT>你是说国防部长
<6-12,BECKETT>Are you suggesting that the secretary of defense

228
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,950
<6-12,BECKETT>有所隐瞒
<6-12,BECKETT>is hiding something?

229
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,840
<6-13,PARKER>有其他的解释吗
<6-13,PARKER>You have another explanation?

230
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,690
<7-1,BECKETT>一瓶失窃的军用毒剂
<7-1,BECKETT>So a stolen military toxin

231
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,330
<7-1,BECKETT>和一个政府秘密基地有关
<7-1,BECKETT>and a secret government base.

232
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,850
<7-1,BECKETT>这究竟是怎么回事
<7-1,BECKETT>I mean, what do you think this is all about?

233
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,280
<7-2,MCCORD>我不知道  但我感觉布朗森知情
<7-2,MCCORD>I don't know, but I have a feeling Bronson did.

234
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,780
<7-3,BECKETT>我们去哪儿
<7-3,BECKETT>Where are we headed?

235
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,520
<7-4,MCCORD>去和那个唯一知道
<7-4,MCCORD>To talk to the one person who might actually

236
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,910
<7-4,MCCORD>发生什么事的人谈谈
<7-4,MCCORD>know what's going on.

237
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,360
<7-4,MCCORD>梦乡的前指挥官
<7-4,MCCORD>Former commander of dreamworld--

238
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,230
<7-4,MCCORD>国防部长里德
<7-4,MCCORD>Defense Secretary Reed.

239
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,750
<8-1,MCCORD>部长先生
<8-1,MCCORD>Mr. Secretary.

240
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,780
<8-2,DEFENSE SECRETARY REED>司法部长亲自请我会见你们
<8-2,DEFENSE SECRETARY REED>This must be damned important if the Attorney General's

241
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,230
<8-2,DEFENSE SECRETARY REED>希望这是十万火急的事
<8-2,DEFENSE SECRETARY REED>personally asking me to take this meeting.

242
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,290
<8-2,DEFENSE SECRETARY REED>确实
<8-2,DEFENSE SECRETARY REED>It is.

243
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,250
<8-3,MCCORD>三天前  一种致命毒剂失窃于
<8-3,MCCORD>Three days ago, a lethal toxin was stolen

244
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,410
<8-3,MCCORD>一个政府实验室
<8-3,MCCORD>from a government lab.

245
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,400
<8-3,MCCORD>我们的调查指向
<8-3,MCCORD>Our investigations led us to the murder

246
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,870
<8-3,MCCORD>前海军士兵杰克·布朗森的谋杀案
<8-3,MCCORD>of an ex-marine named Jack Bronson.

247
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,900
<8-3,MCCORD>-您认识他吗  -有可能
<8-3,MCCORD>- Do you know him? - It's possible.

248
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,200
<8-4,REED>很多人曾服役于我的手下
<8-4,REED>A lot of men served under my command.

249
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,630
<8-4,REED>怎么  你们认为他和失窃案有关
<8-4,REED>Why? You think he was involved in this theft?

250
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,440
<8-5,BECKETT>不  但他可能知道是谁
<8-5,BECKETT>No, but he may have known who was.

251
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,610
<8-5,BECKETT>我们认为这和
<8-5,BECKETT>We believe that this is connected

252
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,030
<8-5,BECKETT>一个叫做梦乡的军事基地有关
<8-5,BECKETT>to a military base named Dreamworld.

253
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,740
<8-6,REED>我不想扫兴  但梦乡只是传奇
<8-6,REED>Well, I hate to break it to you, but Dreamworld's a myth.

254
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,760
<8-6,REED>它是军事传奇  但并不存在
<8-6,REED>It's military legend. It doesn't exist.

255
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,780
<8-7,BECKETT>你在开玩笑吗
<8-7,BECKETT>Are you kidding me?

256
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,790
<8-7,BECKETT>-你真的要玩这种把戏吗  -长官
<8-7,BECKETT>- Are we actually gonna play this game? - Sir--

257
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,800
<8-8,MCCORD>贝克特探员  是吗
<8-8,MCCORD>Agent Beckett, was it?

258
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,620
<8-9,REED>不管毒剂在谁手里  只要他们使用
<8-9,REED>Whoever took that toxin, if they use it,

259
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,160
<8-10,BECKETT>就会出现大面积的伤亡
<8-10,BECKETT>there will be mass casualties,

260
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,130
<8-10,BECKETT>-如果你知道什么  -长官
<8-10,BECKETT>- so if you know something-- - Sir.

261
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,300
<8-11,MCCORD>有人写过关于梦乡的文章
<8-11,MCCORD>Someone was writing an article about Dreamworld.

262
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,890
<8-12,MCCORD>你亲自把封掉了  为什么
<8-12,MCCORD>You personally had that story killed. Why?

263
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,370
<8-13,REED>为什么  因为敌人也读报纸
<8-13,REED>Why? Because the enemy reads newspapers,

264
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,930
<8-13,REED>我不可能冒着美国人民的性命危险
<8-13,REED>and there's no way in hell I'm gonna risk American lives

265
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,240
<8-13,REED>把特别行动基地的
<8-13,REED>by handing out operational details

266
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
<8-13,REED>行动细节交出去
<8-13,REED>about a special ops base...

267
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,370
<8-13,REED>如果这种基地存在的话
<8-13,REED>If such a base existed.

268
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,770
<8-14,BECKETT>布朗森呢
<8-14,BECKETT>What about Bronson?

269
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,380
<8-14,BECKETT>他和基地有什么联系
<8-14,BECKETT>What's his connection to that base?

270
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,230
<8-15,BECKETT>如果它存在的话
<8-15,BECKETT>If it indeed does exist.

271
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,790
<8-16,REED>我即将要说的每句话都不能记录在案
<8-16,REED>Everything I'm about to say is off the books.

272
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,780
<8-16,REED>明白了吗
<8-16,REED>Are we clear?

273
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,040
<8-17,MCCORD>-明白  -明白
<8-17,MCCORD>- Yes. - Yes.

274
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,590
<8-18,BECKETT>布朗森是名杰出的海军陆战队员
<8-18,BECKETT>Bronson was an outstanding marine.

275
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,570
<8-19,REED>但是他只负责一个任务
<8-19,REED>But he only worked one mission out of there--

276
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,840
<8-19,REED>一个在贾拉拉巴德的空袭
<8-19,REED>A high-value air strike in Jalalabad

278
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,390
<8-19,REED>目的是除掉基地组织二号头目阿瓦·扎瓦利
<8-19,REED>that took out Anwar Zawari-- Al-Qaeda's number two.

279
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,470
<8-20,MCCORD>布朗森负责哪个部分
<8-20,MCCORD>What was Bronson's role?

280
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,140
<8-21,REED>他是我们的地面接应人员
<8-21,REED>He was our man on the ground.

281
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,150
<8-21,REED>埋伏在附近的楼里
<8-21,REED>Set up in a nearby building.

282
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,080
<8-21,REED>扎瓦利进去的时候他向上级报告
<8-21,REED>He reported when Zawari went in the house.

283
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,750
<8-21,REED>当空袭启动的时候
<8-21,REED>Then, when the air strike was launched,

284
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,760
<8-21,REED>他用激光指向房子
<8-21,REED>he painted the house with a laser

285
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,440
<8-21,REED>指引导弹
<8-21,REED>to guide the missile.

286
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,680
<8-22,BECKETT>瓦尔基里这个词
<8-22,BECKETT>Did the word "Valkyrie"

287
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,450
<8-22,BECKETT>和空袭有关吗
<8-22,BECKETT>have anything to do with this strike?

288
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,410
<8-22,BECKETT>是任务名还是暗号
<8-22,BECKETT>Was it the name of a mission or a code name?

289
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,360
<8-22,BECKETT>不是
<8-22,BECKETT>No.

290
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,690
<8-23,REED>没听过
<8-23,REED>It's not familiar.

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,430
<8-23,REED>那次行动的成功对我们来说意义重大
<8-23,REED>Look, that operation was a big win for us.

292
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,030
<8-23,REED>重创了基地组织的整个指挥部门
<8-23,REED>It crippled Al-Qaeda's entire command structure.

293
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,430
<8-24,MCCORD>有没有听说基地组织要报复
<8-24,MCCORD>Was there any talk of Al-Qaeda retaliating?

294
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,010
<8-25,REED>有谣言  一直都有
<8-25,REED>There was chatter. Always is.

295
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,060
<8-25,REED>但是我们一年前就除掉了扎瓦利
<8-25,REED>But we took out Zawari a year ago,

296
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,890
<8-25,REED>但他们从未回击
<8-25,REED>and they never hit us back.

297
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,100
<8-26,BECKETT>只不过他们开始回击了
<8-26,BECKETT>Unless they just did.

298
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,230
<8-26,BECKETT>而且只是开始
<8-26,BECKETT>And this is just the beginning.

299
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,810
<9-1,VILANTE>我让国土安全局看紧每个
<9-1,VILANTE>I have Homeland tightening security

300
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,300
<9-1,VILANTE>在特区的潜在目标
<9-1,VILANTE>at every likely D.C. target--

301
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,670
<9-1,VILANTE>政府大楼  景点  交通枢纽
<9-1,VILANTE>Government buildings, tourist attractions, transit hubs.

302
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,040
<9-2,MCCORD>坏消息是毒剂传播途径太多
<9-2,MCCORD>The bad news is the toxin's versatile.

303
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,780
<9-2,MCCORD>可以放置在通风装置里
<9-2,MCCORD>It can be deployed through the ventilation system,

304
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,280
<9-2,MCCORD>可以投进水库
<9-2,MCCORD>it could contaminate a reservoir,

305
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,380
<9-2,MCCORD>放在炸弹里引爆
<9-2,MCCORD>it can be detonated with a bomb

306
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,920
<9-2,MCCORD>毒气飘在城市上空
<9-2,MCCORD>and release a toxic plume over part of this city.

307
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,760
<9-2,MCCORD>如果这样的话  我们就不止要处理
<9-2,MCCORD>And if that happens, we'd be dealing with a lot more

308
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,140
<9-2,MCCORD>一两个死亡案件了
<9-2,MCCORD>than just a couple of deaths on our hands.

309
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,320
<9-2,MCCORD>实在对不起
<9-2,MCCORD>And I am so sorry.

310
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,920
<9-2,MCCORD>没事  这是你的工作
<9-2,MCCORD>No, it's... your job.

311
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,320
<9-3,CASTLE>如果我们阻止下次袭击  也许可以救我
<9-3,CASTLE>And if we stop the next attack, it might mean saving me.

312
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,250
<9-3,CASTLE>但如果这是基地组织的报复
<9-3,CASTLE>But if this is Al-Qaeda retaliation,

313
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,780
<9-3,CASTLE>他们是怎么知道布朗森的
<9-3,CASTLE>how did they know about Bronson?

314
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,730
<9-4,BECKETT>那次空袭他是地面接应人员
<9-4,BECKETT>He was on the ground during the air strike.

315
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,910
<9-4,BECKETT>他可能被当地人
<9-4,BECKETT>He might have been seen by locals

316
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,650
<9-4,BECKETT>或者扎瓦利家里人看见了
<9-4,BECKETT>or Zawari family members.

317
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,780
<9-5,VILANTE>我们去查在特区的
<9-5,VILANTE>Well, let's check for any Zawari family members,

318
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,000
<9-5,VILANTE>扎瓦利家人  朋友或者与其有关的人
<9-5,VILANTE>friends, or associates in the D.C. area.

319
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
<9-5,VILANTE>如果基地组织要反击
<9-5,VILANTE>If Al-Qaeda is about to strike,

320
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,690
<9-5,VILANTE>他们一定有线人在这边
<9-5,VILANTE>they must have people on the ground.

321
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,610
<9-6,MCCORD>我去技术室
<9-6,MCCORD>I'll be in the tech room.

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,600
<11-12,BECKETT>-和解药  -行动
<11-12,BECKETT>- And the antidote. - Let's move!

397
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,260
<12-1,BECKETT>站住  站住
<12-1,BECKETT>Stop! Stop!

398
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,580
<12-3,BECKETT>联邦探员  站住
<12-3,BECKETT>Federal agents! Stop!

399
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,770
<12-4,BECKETT>不在包里
<12-4,BECKETT>It's not here.

400
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,420
<12-4,BECKETT>毒剂在哪
<12-4,BECKETT>Where's the toxin?

401
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,520
<12-4,BECKETT>拉希德  毒剂在哪
<12-4,BECKETT>Rasheed! Where's the toxin?

402
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,490
<13-1,CASTLE>他不开口怎么办
<13-1,CASTLE>What if he doesn't talk?

403
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,590
<13-2,VILANTE>他会开口的  嫌犯都这样
<13-2,VILANTE>He'll talk. They always do.

404
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,360
<13-3,CASTLE>如果他没及时交待呢
<13-3,CASTLE>What if he doesn't talk in time?

405
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,380
<13-4,VILANTE>已经派人搜查他的住处了
<13-4,VILANTE>We have teams combing his apartment.

406
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,870
<13-4,VILANTE>如果他有毒剂和解药  会找到的
<13-4,VILANTE>If he has the toxin and the antidote, they'll find 'em.

407
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,650
<13-4,VILANTE>谢谢你
<13-4,VILANTE>Thanks...

408
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,390
<13-5,CASTLE>让我参与这次行动
<13-5,CASTLE>for letting me be a part of this.

409
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,180
<13-6,VILANTE>你在写下一部小说的时候
<13-6,VILANTE>When you write your next novel,

410
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,200
<13-6,VILANTE>不妨写一写
<13-6,VILANTE>maybe you'll find a place

411
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,020
<13-6,VILANTE>一位英俊勇猛的哥伦比亚裔联邦探员
<13-6,VILANTE>for a dashing Colombian-American federal agent.

412
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,330
<13-7,CASTLE>包在我身上
<13-7,CASTLE>Consider it done.

413
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,890
<13-8,VILANTE>在拉希德家里找到什么了吗
<13-8,VILANTE>Anything at Rasheed's?

414
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,890
<13-9,BECKETT>我们翻遍了所有角落
<13-9,BECKETT>We went over every inch of his place,

415
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,430
<13-9,BECKETT>都没找到解药和毒剂
<13-9,BECKETT>and there is no sign of the antidote or the toxin.

416
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,130
<13-9,BECKETT>他可能将其藏在某处
<13-9,BECKETT>He may have hidden it somewhere.

417
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,260
<13-10,MCCORD>不然就是已经布置好
<13-10,MCCORD>Either that or it's already out there,

418
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,740
<13-10,MCCORD>准备投放了
<13-10,MCCORD>ready to be deployed.

419
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,840
<13-11,VILANTE>撬开他的嘴
<13-11,VILANTE>Break him.

420
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,970
<14-1,RASHEED>为什么抓我
<14-1,RASHEED>So why am I here?

421
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,500
<14-1,RASHEED>这都是怎么回事
<14-1,RASHEED>What's this about? Huh?

422
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,030
<14-2,BECKETT>你跟阿瓦·扎瓦利是亲戚  对不对
<14-2,BECKETT>You're related to Anwar Zawari. Is that correct?

423
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,050
<14-3,RASHEED>人无法选择自己的家庭
<14-3,RASHEED>A man doesn't choose his family.

424
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,090
<14-3,RASHEED>阿瓦和他的信仰都与我无关
<14-3,RASHEED>Okay? I had nothing to do with Anwar or his beliefs.

425
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,230
<14-4,BECKETT>但是他死掉当晚你在贾拉拉巴德
<14-4,BECKETT>Yet you were in Jalalabad the night that he died.

426
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,070
<14-5,RASHEED>是  但不是去见他  我有亲戚在那儿
<14-5,RASHEED>Yes, but not to see him. I have relatives there.

428
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,800
<14-5,RASHEED>我跟他们一起过斋月
<14-5,RASHEED>I was spending time with them for Ramadan.

429
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,320
<14-6,MCCORD>我了解到你的五个亲戚
<14-6,MCCORD>I understand that five of your relatives

430
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,390
<14-6,MCCORD>在美方导弹袭击中丧生
<14-6,MCCORD>were killed in that U.S. Missile strike.

431
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,910
<14-7,RASHEED>所以我把这归咎于阿瓦  是他们要跟着他
<14-7,RASHEED>And for that I blame Anwar, and them for being with him.

432
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,160
<14-7,RASHEED>为什么抓我到这儿
<14-7,RASHEED>Now why am I here?

433
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,090
<14-8,MCCORD>你是学工程的
<14-8,MCCORD>You studied engineering.

434
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,290
<14-8,MCCORD>确切地说  是电气系统设计
<14-8,MCCORD>Specifically, electrical system designs

435
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,850
<14-8,MCCORD>用于商业建筑
<14-8,MCCORD>for commercial buildings.

436
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,040
<14-9,RASHEED>你真有本事把所有事都说得那么邪恶
<14-9,RASHEED>You have a gift for making every fact sound sinister.

437
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,730
<14-10,MCCORD>你有能力侵入机密工厂
<14-10,MCCORD>Well, you'd be able to break into a secure facility.

438
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,680
<14-11,RASHEED>我没有闯入任何建筑
<14-11,RASHEED>I didn't break into anything.

439
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,030
<14-11,RASHEED>我要见律师  我有权见律师
<14-11,RASHEED>I want an attorney. I have a right to an attorney.

440
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,020
<14-12,MCCORD>政府公敌没有律师  或者审判
<14-12,MCCORD>Enemy combatants don't get attorneys... or trials.

441
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,170
<14-13,BECKETT>毒剂在哪  拉希德
<14-13,BECKETT>Where is the toxin, Rasheed?

442
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,770
<14-14,RASHEED>我不知道你们在说什么
<14-14,RASHEED>I don't know what you're talking about.

443
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,540
<14-15,BECKETT>我认为你知道  事实上我确认你知道
<14-15,BECKETT>I think you do. In fact, I know you do.

444
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,960
<14-15,BECKETT>这是杰克·布朗森  前海军陆战队员
<14-15,BECKETT>This is Jack Bronson, former U.S. Marine.

445
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,390
<14-15,BECKETT>袭击当晚他在贾拉拉巴德
<14-15,BECKETT>He was in Jalalabad the night of the strike.

446
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,410
<14-15,BECKETT>而这
<14-15,BECKETT>And this...

447
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,350
<14-15,BECKETT>是你  跟着他出了咖啡店
<14-15,BECKETT>is you, following him outside of a coffee shop.

448
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,130
<14-15,BECKETT>三小时后  他死了
<14-15,BECKETT>Three hours later, he was dead.

449
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,350
<14-15,BECKETT>别跟我说这是什么巧合
<14-15,BECKETT>You're not gonna tell me that that's a coincidence.

450
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,620
<14-16,RASHEED>是因为他吗
<14-16,RASHEED>This is about him?

451
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,710
<14-16,RASHEED>你们搞错了
<14-16,RASHEED>Well, you have it wrong.

452
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,000
<14-16,RASHEED>我没有跟踪他
<14-16,RASHEED>I wasn't following him.

453
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,190
<14-16,RASHEED>是他在跟踪我
<14-16,RASHEED>He was following me.

454
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,540
<14-17,MCCORD>他为什么要跟踪你
<14-17,MCCORD>Why would he be following you?

455
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,140
<14-18,RASHEED>他想知道我有没有把我们之间的秘密
<14-18,RASHEED>He wanted to know if I talked to anybody...

456
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,190
<14-18,RASHEED>告诉别人
<14-18,RASHEED>about our secret.

457
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,050
<14-19,MCCORD>你们之间的秘密
<14-19,MCCORD>Your secret?

458
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,520
<14-19,MCCORD>什么秘密
<14-19,MCCORD>What secret?

459
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,780
<14-19,MCCORD>导弹袭击那晚
<14-19,MCCORD>The night of the missile strike,

460
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,920
<14-20,RASHEED>我在我哥家
<14-20,RASHEED>I was, uh, at my brother's home.

461
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,310
<14-20,RASHEED>离阿瓦家只有一个街区
<14-20,RASHEED>It's just a block away from Anwar's.

462
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,450
<14-20,RASHEED>我听到爆炸声  跑了出去
<14-20,RASHEED>I heard the explosion. I ran out.

463
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,610
<14-20,RASHEED>房子炸毁了  我是第一个赶到的
<14-20,RASHEED>The house was destroyed. And I was the first one there,

464
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,270
<14-20,RASHEED>所以我去看看有没有幸存者
<14-20,RASHEED>so I wanted to see if there were any survivors.

465
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,150
<14-20,RASHEED>那时
<14-20,RASHEED>And that's, uh...

466
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,030
<14-20,RASHEED>那时我看到了布朗森
<14-20,RASHEED>that's when I saw Bronson,

467
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,900
<14-20,RASHEED>站在废墟中  抱着一具尸体
<14-20,RASHEED>standing there in the rubble, holding a body.

468
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,970
<14-21,BECKETT>是谁
<14-21,BECKETT>Whose body?

469
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,320
<14-22,RASHEED>一个年轻女子
<14-22,RASHEED>A young woman.

470
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,380
<14-22,RASHEED>是一个女仆
<14-22,RASHEED>One of the servants in the house.

471
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,180
<14-22,RASHEED>当他看到我的时候  他...
<14-22,RASHEED>And when he saw me, he...

472
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,120
<14-22,RASHEED>举起枪
<14-22,RASHEED>drew his gun.

473
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,220
<14-22,RASHEED>我觉得自己必死无疑了
<14-22,RASHEED>And I thought for sure I was a dead man.

474
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,910
<14-22,RASHEED>但他说话了
<14-22,RASHEED>But then he spoke.

475
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,980
<14-22,RASHEED>他知道我的名字
<14-22,RASHEED>And he knew my name

476
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,090
<14-22,RASHEED>我的住处  我的工作
<14-22,RASHEED>and where I lived and what I did.

477
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,040
<14-22,RASHEED>他还说如果我告诉别人我看到的事
<14-22,RASHEED>And he told me that if I told anyone about what I had seen,

478
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,310
<14-22,RASHEED>就杀了我
<14-22,RASHEED>he would kill me.

479
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,610
<14-22,RASHEED>然后他走了
<14-22,RASHEED>And then he left...

480
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,660
<14-22,RASHEED>抱着那具尸体
<14-22,RASHEED>with the body.

481
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,720
<14-23,MCCORD>他带走了一个女仆的尸体
<14-23,MCCORD>He took away a dead servant's body?

482
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,590
<14-24,RASHEED>我尽力忘记这件事
<14-24,RASHEED>I've done my best to forget about it all,

483
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,630
<14-24,RASHEED>直到他在咖啡店找到我
<14-24,RASHEED>until he found me in the coffee shop,

484
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,610
<14-24,RASHEED>他不停地问我  你还告诉谁了
<14-24,RASHEED>and he kept asking me, "Who did you tell?

485
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,270
<14-24,RASHEED>他们为什么陷害我  我对他发誓
<14-24,RASHEED>Why are they setting me up?" And I swore to him

486
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,660
<14-24,RASHEED>我没有告诉任何人
<14-24,RASHEED>I didn't tell anybody.

487
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,250
<14-24,RASHEED>无论现在发生什么事情  什么情况
<14-24,RASHEED>Okay, whatever is happening here, whatever is going on,

488
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,910
<14-24,RASHEED>我发誓和我一点关系都没有
<14-24,RASHEED>I swear to you I have nothing to do with it.

489
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,710
<15-1,VILANTE>没有任何情报组织能把拉希德
<15-1,VILANTE>So none of the intelligence agencies can link Rasheed

490
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,590
<15-1,VILANTE>和已知基地组织联系在一起
<15-1,VILANTE>to known Al-qaeda elements.

491
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,260
<15-1,VILANTE>而且
<15-1,VILANTE>And...

492
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,240
<15-1,VILANTE>他在劫案发生当晚有可靠的不在场证明
<15-1,VILANTE>He's got a solid alibi for the night of the break-in.

493
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,530
<15-2,MCCORD>那他也有参与的可能
<15-2,MCCORD>He could still be involved.

494
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,740
<15-2,MCCORD>有没有关于近期即将发生袭击的消息
<15-2,MCCORD>Is there any chatter about an imminent attack?

495
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,020
<15-3,VILANTE>没什么异常
<15-3,VILANTE>No more than usual.

496
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,680
<15-3,VILANTE>你对拉希德有何看法
<15-3,VILANTE>What's your take on Rasheed?

497
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,610
<15-4,BECKETT>我觉得他不是我们要找的人
<15-4,BECKETT>I don't think he's our guy.

498
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,180
<15-5,VILANE>基于什么
<15-5,VILANE>Base on?

499
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,720
<15-6,BECKETT>他的故事  他说他看见布朗森
<15-6,BECKETT>His story. I mean, he said that he saw Bronson

500
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
<15-6,BECKETT>在转移女仆的尸体
<15-6,BECKETT>carrying a servant girl's body.

501
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,220
<15-6,BECKETT>我觉得他能想出
<15-6,BECKETT>I mean, the only way that he'd come up

502
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,480
<15-6,BECKETT>这样的故事  只能是因为他亲眼所见
<15-6,BECKETT>with a story like that was if it was true.

503
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,210
<15-7,CASTLE>所以说除了"瓦尔基里"
<15-7,CASTLE>So aside from the name "Valkyrie," which no one we've spoken to

504
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,740
<15-7,CASTLE>这个我们讯问过的人都不知道的名字
<15-7,CASTLE>seems to know anything about,

505
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,900
<15-7,CASTLE>我们基本一无所获  而我必死无疑
<15-7,CASTLE>we pretty much have nothing, which means I'm a dead man.

506
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,380
<15-8,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  不是一无所获
<15-8,BECKETT>No, Castle. Not nothing.

507
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,810
<15-8,BECKETT>我们有布朗森和你说的话  拉希德告诉我们的情况
<15-8,BECKETT>We have what Bronson told you, what Rasheed told us.

508
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,510
<15-8,BECKETT>我们知道这一切都围绕着
<15-8,BECKETT>We know that this revolves around something

509
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,690
<15-8,BECKETT>扎瓦利被杀当晚的事件展开的
<15-8,BECKETT>that happened the night Zawari was killed,

510
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,940
<15-8,BECKETT>而这件事不止是空袭那么简单
<15-8,BECKETT>something more than just the air strike.

511
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,610
<15-8,BECKETT>我们现在只要搞清楚这件事是什么
<15-8,BECKETT>Now what we have to do is figure out what it was.

512
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,910
<15-9,VILANTE>我已经让国防部发来了任务文件
<15-9,VILANTE>I'll have D.O.D. send over the mission documents.

513
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,110
<15-9,VILANTE>或许会对我们有所帮助
<15-9,VILANTE>Maybe something in there will help shed some light.

514
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,130
<16-1,BECKETT>这些就是任务文件
<16-1,BECKETT>These are the mission documents?

515
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,320
<16-2,MCCORD>就没有一句是完整的吗
<16-2,MCCORD>Is there even a sentence that doesn't have redactions?

516
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,530
<16-3,RICHMOND>没有一句
<16-3,RICHMOND>Not a complete one.

517
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,920
<16-3,RICHMOND>一定是有人在试图掩盖事实真相
<16-3,RICHMOND>Somebody is definitely trying to hide whatever went on here.

518
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,110
<16-4,BECKETT>抱歉  卡塞尔  这一点意义都没有
<16-4,BECKETT>I-I'm sorry, Castle. This is pointless.

519
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,050
<16-5,CASTLE>你能搜索关键词"瓦尔基里"吗
<16-5,CASTLE>Can you do a word search for "Valkyrie"?

520
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,460
<16-6,RICHMOND>文件中没有出现
<16-6,RICHMOND>It doesn't appear in the document.

521
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,350
<16-6,RICHMOND>可能是因为被划掉了
<16-6,RICHMOND>Probably because it's redacted.

522
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,200
<16-7,CASTLE>对  那搜索
<16-7,CASTLE>Right. But what about

523
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,330
<16-7,CASTLE>和英文"瓦尔基里"一样长度
<16-7,CASTLE>a search for blacked-out 8-letter words

524
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,600
<16-7,CASTLE>但被遮蔽的八个字符呢
<16-7,CASTLE>the same length as "Valkyrie"?

525
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,290
<16-8,MCCORD>八个字符的词多了去了
<16-8,MCCORD>Aren't all 8-letter words the same length?

526
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,250
<16-9,CASTLE>但这样的情况不会在新罗马体中出现
<16-9,CASTLE>Well, not in a proportional font like Times Roman.

527
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,080
<16-9,CASTLE>每个字符大小不一
<16-9,CASTLE>Each character will vary in size

528
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,930
<16-9,CASTLE>从最窄的小写"i"
<16-9,CASTLE>from the narrowest-- a lowercase "I"--

529
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,660
<16-9,CASTLE>到最宽的大写"W"
<16-9,CASTLE>to the widest-- the uppercase "W."

530
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,150
<16-9,CASTLE>所以在"瓦尔基里"一词的字母组合
<16-9,CASTLE>So the combination of letters in the word "Valkyrie"

531
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,150
<16-9,CASTLE>会产生一个特定的长度
<16-9,CASTLE>will create a very specific length,

532
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,730
<16-9,CASTLE>和印刷指纹有点像
<16-9,CASTLE>Not unlike a typographical fingerprint.

533
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,230
<16-10,RICHMOND>我可以尝试一下
<16-10,RICHMOND>I may be able to work with that.

534
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,630
<16-11,BECKETT>如果我们能找到被屏蔽的"瓦尔基里"
<16-11,BECKETT>If we can find the blacked-out "Valkyrie,"

535
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,950
<16-11,BECKETT>我们就能通过周围的单词
<16-11,BECKETT>we might be able to figure out what it means

536
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,210
<16-11,BECKETT>破解它的意义
<16-11,BECKETT>from the words around it.

537
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,600
<16-12,CASTLE>希望渺茫  我知道
<16-12,CASTLE>It's a long shot, I know.

538
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
<16-13,RICHMOND>没那么渺茫  我们有发现了
<16-13,RICHMOND>Not that long. We got some hits.

539
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,290
<16-13,RICHMOND>这些是文件的缩略图
<16-13,RICHMOND>These are thumbnails of the whole document.

540
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,130
<16-13,RICHMOND>每一张上都有  用红色标出
<16-13,RICHMOND>It's everywhere, highlighted in red.

541
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,020
<16-14,BECKETT>而最后一页似乎最为频繁
<16-14,BECKETT>The last page seems to have the largest concentration.

542
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,350
<16-14,BECKETT>能放大吗
<16-14,BECKETT>Can you enlarge it?

543
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,070
<16-15,MCCORD>"获取目标"  "导弹发射"
<16-15,MCCORD>"Target acquired." "Missile engaged."

544
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,970
<16-15,MCCORD>"目标摧毁"
<16-15,MCCORD>"Target destroyed."

545
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,940
<16-15,MCCORD>这是导弹袭击的文字记录稿
<16-15,MCCORD>This is the transcript to the missile strike.

546
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,850
<16-16,CASTLE>或许"瓦尔基里"是扎瓦利的代号
<16-16,CASTLE>Maybe "Valkyrie" Is the code name for Zawari.

547
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,030
<16-17,BECKETT>不  不会那么简单
<16-17,BECKETT>No, it's got to be more than that,

548
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,940
<16-17,BECKETT>但是没有足够的上下文来破解词义
<16-17,BECKETT>but there's not enough context to piece this thing together.

549
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,560
<16-17,BECKETT>我们需要的是原件
<16-17,BECKETT>What we need is an un-redacted transcript.

550
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,970
<16-18,RICHMOND>或者是原始录音
<16-18,RICHMOND>Or the original audio recording.

551
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,840
<16-19,MCCORD>你是怎么想的  里奇蒙德
<16-19,MCCORD>What are you thinking, Richmond?

552
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,530
<16-20,RICHMOND>对于贾拉拉巴德的袭击
<16-20,RICHMOND>For a strike in Jalalabad,

553
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,570
<16-20,RICHMOND>可能会用到巴格拉姆空军基地的F16战斗机
<16-20,RICHMOND>They'd probably use an f-16 out of Bagram Air Base.

554
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,070
<16-20,RICHMOND>我曾在那里做过一年的技术主管
<16-20,RICHMOND>I did a year as chief technical officer at bagram.

555
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,060
<16-20,RICHMOND>工作的一部分就是将战斗机的飞行数据
<16-20,RICHMOND>Part of my job was dumping the fighter jets' flight data

556
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,720
<16-20,RICHMOND>存入到中央服务器中
<16-20,RICHMOND>onto a central server.

557
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,710
<16-20,RICHMOND>如果我能进入到服务器中
<16-20,RICHMOND>If I can access it,

558
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,920
<16-20,RICHMOND>我可能会拿到录音
<16-20,RICHMOND>I might be able to get that audio.

559
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,880
<16-21,BECKETT>我们还等什么  麦考德
<16-21,BECKETT>What are we waiting for, McCord?

560
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,700
<16-21,BECKETT>我们照章办事  而他们就给了我们这个
<16-21,BECKETT>We played by the rules, and that's what they gave us.

561
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,790
<16-22,MCCORD>动手吧
<16-22,MCCORD>Do it.

562
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,090
<16-23,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你妈妈
<16-23,BECKETT>Castle. It's your mom.

563
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,440
<16-23,BECKETT>你想让我怎么说
<16-23,BECKETT>What do you want me to tell her?

564
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,610
<17-1,BECKETT>你已接通司法部长办公室
<17-1,BECKETT>You've reached the voicemail of Special Agent Kate Beckett

565
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,110
<17-1,BECKETT>联邦探员凯特·贝克特的语音信箱
<17-1,BECKETT>at the Attorney General's office.

566
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,340
<17-1,BECKETT>请留言
<17-1,BECKETT>Please leave a message.

567
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,560
<18-1,KEVIN RYAN>我只是一直觉得咱俩
<18-1,KEVIN RYAN>I just always thought that you and I

568
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,020
<18-1,KEVIN RYAN>会一起养个孩子
<18-1,KEVIN RYAN>Would have kids together.

569
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,950
<18-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>真的  你跟珍妮说过咱俩好上的事了吗
<18-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Really? Well, have you talked to Jenny about this?

570
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,160
<18-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>你知道我的意思
<18-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>No, you know what I mean.

571
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,570
<18-3,RYAN>他们会在同一个棒球橄榄球队
<18-3,RYAN>They'd be on the same t-ball and pop warner teams.

572
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<18-4,ESPOSITO>-我们会一起当教练  -一起
<18-4,ESPOSITO>- We'd co-coach. - Co-coach?

573
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,430
<18-5,RYAN>-你想当主教练  -当然
<18-5,RYAN>- You want to be head coach? - Yeah.

574
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,350
<18-7,RYAN>-那就先找孩他妈  -兄弟
<18-7,RYAN>- Try getting a date first. - Dude.

575
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,900
<18-8,ESPOSITO>玛莎  你怎么来了
<18-8,ESPOSITO>Hey. Martha. What brings you here?

576
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,480
<18-10,MARTHA>我知道你们很忙  但是我
<18-10,MARTHA>Look, I know you're busy, but I'm--

577
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,170
<18-10,MARTHA>-我很担心理查德  -真的  怎么了
<18-10,MARTHA>- I'm worried about Richard. - Really? Why?

578
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,050
<18-12,MARTHA>昨晚  他被几个
<18-12,MARTHA>Last night, he was just whisked away

579
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,500
<18-12,MARTHA>联邦探员"暴徒"给抓走了
<18-12,MARTHA>by a couple of federal agent... thugs.

580
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,990
<18-12,MARTHA>但是当我今天打给他
<18-12,MARTHA>Then when I talked to him today,

581
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,970
<18-12,MARTHA>他友好又真诚  也没有臭屁
<18-12,MARTHA>he was nice, sincere, no smart-ass quips.

582
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,480
<18-12,MARTHA>所以  一定是出事了
<18-12,MARTHA>So... something is definitely wrong.

583
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,450
<18-12,MARTHA>而凯瑟琳也不接我电话
<18-12,MARTHA>And Katherine isn't answering my calls.

584
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,940
<18-13,RYAN>那一定是事出有因
<18-13,RYAN>Well, uh, I'm sure there's an explanation.

585
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,780
<18-14,MARTHA>所以我需要你们查出来
<18-14,MARTHA>And I need you to find out what it is.

586
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,790
<19-1,GOLDBERG>有呼吸困难吗
<19-1,GOLDBERG>Any trouble breathing?

587
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,540
<19-2,CASTLE>是  但可能是我太焦虑了
<19-2,CASTLE>Yeah, but I-I think that's just anxiety.

588
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,330
<19-3,GOLDBERG>-我可以给你镇定剂  -不
<19-3,GOLDBERG>- I can get you a sedative. - No.

589
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,830
<19-4,CASTLE>谢谢  我还是尽量保持清醒吧
<19-4,CASTLE>I--thank you. I think I'd rather stay sharp as long as possible.

590
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,360
<19-5,MCCORD>抱歉
<19-5,MCCORD>Oh, sorry.

591
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,970
<19-6,CASTLE>不  没事  我们完事了
<19-6,CASTLE>No, no problem. We're all done here.

592
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,680
<19-7,MCCORD>要咖啡吗
<19-7,MCCORD>You want a coffee?

593
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,900
<19-8,CASTLE>不  让我喝那难喝的东西还不如让我死呢
<19-8,CASTLE>Uh, no, I'd rather die than drink any more of that sludge.

594
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,940
<19-9,CASTLE>玩笑开太早了
<19-9,CASTLE>Too soon?

595
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,350
<19-10,CASTLE>麦考德探员  我能问你个问题吗
<19-10,CASTLE>Agent McCord, Can I ask you a question?

596
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,080
<19-11,MCCORD>当然
<19-11,MCCORD>Yeah.

597
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,690
<19-12,CASTLE>她在这里怎么样
<19-12,CASTLE>How is she doing... here?

598
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,110
<19-13,MCCORD>贝克特  她很好  很有潜力
<19-13,MCCORD>Beckett? She's good. She has a lot of potential.

599
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,620
<19-14,CASTLE>所以她会很好的
<19-14,CASTLE>So she'll be okay.

600
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,040
<19-15,MCCORD>她会很好的
<19-15,MCCORD>Hey. She's gonna be great.

601
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,750
<19-16,RICHMOND>麦考德  我进去了
<19-16,RICHMOND>Hey, McCord. I'm in.

602
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,850
<20-1,RICHMOND>我把巴格拉姆的飞行记录信息库
<20-1,RICHMOND>I cross-referenced the flight recording database at bagram

603
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,420
<20-1,RICHMOND>和任务文件中的参数进行对比
<20-1,RICHMOND>with parameters from the mission documents.

604
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,430
<20-1,RICHMOND>如果信息准确
<20-1,RICHMOND>If that information was accurate,

605
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,690
<20-1,RICHMOND>这应该就是扎瓦利空袭的音频
<20-1,RICHMOND>this should be audio of the Zawari strike.

606
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,090
<20-2,PILOT>A1  老鹰接触到目标
<20-2,PILOT>Alpha One, Eagle's contact target.

607
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,890
<20-3,REED>收到  老鹰  奥马哈  报告情况  完毕
<20-3,REED>Copy, Eagle. Omaha, what's your status? Over.

608
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,590
<20-4,BECKETT>那是国防部长里德
<20-4,BECKETT>That's defense secretary Reed.

609
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,900
<20-5,MCCORD>他是战区司令  要指挥行动的
<20-5,MCCORD>As theater commander, he'd be running the operation.

610
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,460
<20-6,BRONSON>A1  瓦尔基里仍在目标范围内
<20-6,BRONSON>Alpha One, Valkyrie still inside target.

611
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,980
<20-7,CASTLE>那是布朗森的声音
<20-7,CASTLE>That's Bronson's voice.

612
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,160
<20-7,CASTLE>那瓦尔基里一定就是扎瓦利了
<20-7,CASTLE>So Valkyrie must be Zawari.

613
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,380
<20-8,REED>老鹰  准备开火
<20-8,REED>Eagle, prepare to engage.

614
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,480
<20-8,REED>A1  瓦尔基里仍在目标里
<20-8,REED>Alpha One, Valkyrie still inside.

615
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,690
<20-9,BRONSON>正在发送信号救她出来
<20-9,BRONSON>Signaling to get her out.

616
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,300
<20-10,BECKETT>"她"  那瓦尔基里就不是扎瓦利
<20-10,BECKETT>Get "her" Out? Valkyrie's not Zawari.

617
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,560
<20-10,BECKETT>或许是仆人
<20-10,BECKETT>Maybe it's the servant.

618
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,060
<20-11,REED>奥马哈  瓦尔基里得马上出来了
<20-11,REED>Omaha, Valkyrie needs to get out now.

619
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,580
<20-12,BRONSON>我在发信号  A1  但是没收到回复  待命
<20-12,BRONSON>I'm signaling, Alpha One. No response. Stand by.

620
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,070
<20-13,REED>我们要错失机会了
<20-13,REED>We're not missing our window.

621
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,700
<20-13,REED>老鹰  这里是A1  向目标开火
<20-13,REED>Eagle, this is Alpha One. Engage target.

622
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,970
<20-14,BRONSON>不行  老鹰  有美国情报人员在里面
<20-14,BRONSON>Negative, Eagle. We have an American Intelligence asset in there,

623
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,830
<20-14,BRONSON>我们得等她出来
<20-14,BRONSON>and we need to wait for her get her out.

624
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,960
<20-15,CASTLE>情报人员
<20-15,CASTLE>An intelligence asset?

625
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,310
<20-16,BRONSON>再给我两分钟
<20-16,BRONSON>Just give me two minutes.

626
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,080
<20-17,REED>不行  奥马哈  我们不能失去肉食鸟
<20-17,REED>Negative, Omaha. We can't risk losing Raptor.

627
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,700
<20-17,REED>我命令你向目标开火  完毕
<20-17,REED>On my authority, you are clear to engage target. Over.

628
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,190
<20-18,PILOT>导弹发射
<20-18,PILOT>Missile engaged.

629
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,540
<20-19,BRONSON>不行  瓦尔基里还在里面
<20-19,BRONSON>No! Valkyrie's still in there.

630
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,650
<20-20,PILOT>目标摧毁  老鹰回巢
<20-20,PILOT>Target destroyed. Eagle heading home.

631
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,000
<20-21,REED>奥马哈  找回瓦尔基里的尸体
<20-21,REED>Omaha, retrieve Valkyrie's body

632
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,690
<20-21,REED>带她回梦乡
<20-21,REED>and get her back to Dreamworld.

633
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,350
<20-21,REED>-飞去来协议  完毕  -收到
<20-21,REED>- Protocol boomerang. Over. - Roger.

634
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,320
<20-23,CASTLE>瓦尔基里是那个女仆  她是我们的人
<20-23,CASTLE>Valkyrie was the servant. She was one of ours.

635
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,460
<20-24,MCCORD>难怪对话记录改了那么多
<20-24,MCCORD>No wonder the transcript was so heavily redacted.

636
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,040
<20-25,BECKETT>国防部长里德下令杀死了一名美国情报人员
<20-25,BECKETT>Secretary Reed killed an American operative.

637
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,890
<20-26,CASTLE>然后还让布朗森掩盖此事
<20-26,CASTLE>And then ordered Bronson to cover it up.

638
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,780
<20-18,PILOT>导弹发射
<20-18,PILOT>Missile engaged.

639
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,030
<20-19,BRONSON>不行  瓦尔基里还在里面
<20-19,BRONSON>No! Valkyrie's still in there.

640
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,160
<20-20,PILOT>目标摧毁  老鹰回巢
<20-20,PILOT>Target destroyed. Eagle heading home.

641
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,450
<20-21,REED>奥马哈  找回瓦尔基里的尸体
<20-21,REED>Omaha, retrieve Valkyrie's body

642
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,240
<20-21,REED>带她回梦乡
<20-21,REED>and get her back to Dreamworld.

643
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,340
<20-21,REED>-飞去来协议  完毕  -收到
<20-21,REED>- Protocol boomerang. Over. - Roger.

644
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,870
<20-22,BRONSON>那现在是什么情况
<20-22,BRONSON>So what are we saying here?

645
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,660
<20-24,MCCORD>布朗森的被杀是为了掩盖
<20-24,MCCORD>That Bronson was murdered to cover up the death

646
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,960
<20-25,BECKETT>一名美国情报人员的死
<20-25,BECKETT>of an American operative?

647
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,200
<21-6,VILANTE>同时里德将军还牵扯其中
<21-6,VILANTE>With the implication that general Reed is behind it?

648
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,250
<21-6,VILANTE>也就是当今的国防部长
<21-6,VILANTE>The sitting secretary of defense?

649
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,680
<21-7,MCCORD>他能爬到这个位子
<21-7,MCCORD>A position he got

650
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,420
<21-7,MCCORD>很大程度上是因为他成功歼灭扎瓦利
<21-7,MCCORD>largely because of his success in taking out Zawari.

651
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,160
<21-8,BECKETT>他的政治前途一片光明
<21-8,BECKETT>His political star was on the rise.

652
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,120
<21-8,BECKETT>或许他不能允许有对他不利的事泄露
<21-8,BECKETT>Maybe he couldn't afford to have damaging details out there.

653
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,240
<21-9,VILANTE>但如果他想灭布朗森的口
<21-9,VILANTE>But if he wanted to silence Bronson,

654
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,840
<21-9,VILANTE>何必那么麻烦先陷害他
<21-9,VILANTE>why would he go through the trouble of setting him up first?

655
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,300
<21-9,VILANTE>而且这一切都不能解释毒素被盗
<21-9,VILANTE>And none of this explains the theft of the toxin.

656
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,050
<21-10,BECKETT>长官  他在瓦尔基里和布朗森的事上都对我们撒谎了
<21-10,BECKETT>Sir, he lied to us about Valkyrie and about Bronson.

657
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,680
<21-10,BECKETT>这事要么与他有关
<21-10,BECKETT>Either he's involved,

658
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,090
<21-10,BECKETT>要么他也有很多事情隐瞒没说
<21-10,BECKETT>or he knows a hell of a lot more than he's telling us.

659
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,000
<21-11,VILANTE>但是你没有证据
<21-11,VILANTE>Only you have no proof.

660
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,060
<21-11,VILANTE>贝克特  我知道对于你和卡塞尔
<21-11,VILANTE>Listen, Beckett, I know what's at stake

661
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,500
<21-11,VILANTE>这事有多严重
<21-11,VILANTE>for you and for Castle,

662
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,670
<21-11,VILANTE>但是  我不能让你在没有证据的情况下去找他
<21-11,VILANTE>but... I can't let you go at him without concrete evidence.

663
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,570
<22-1,CASTLE>维尔莱迪没同意
<22-1,CASTLE>Hey. So I'm guessing Villante said "No"

664
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,200
<22-1,CASTLE>对里德部长施水刑  逼他说出实情
<22-1,CASTLE>to the idea of waterboarding the truth out of secretary Reed.

665
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,160
<22-2,BECKETT>是啊  差不多吧
<22-2,BECKETT>Yeah. Something like that.

666
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,570
<22-2,BECKETT>你还好吗
<22-2,BECKETT>How are you feeling?

667
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,580
<22-3,CASTLE>还行  我觉得我该再去打一针了
<22-3,CASTLE>Ah. Good. I think I'm just due for another shot.

668
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,110
<22-3,CASTLE>我是司法部长办公室的贝克特探员
<22-3,CASTLE>I'm agent Beckett from the Attorney General's office.

669
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,160
<23-1,BECKETT>-我要跟里德部长谈谈  -有预约吗
<23-1,BECKETT>- I need to speak with secretary Reed. - Do you have an appointment?

670
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,140
<23-2,BODYGUARD>不  事关国家安全
<23-2,BODYGUARD>No, this is a matter of national security.

671
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,890
<23-3,BECKETT>抱歉  如果你没预约...
<23-3,BECKETT>I'm sorry. If you don't have an appointment,

672
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,770
<23-4,BODYGUARD>-我就得请你  -我明白
<23-4,BODYGUARD>- I have to ask you- - I-I understand.

673
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,440
<23-5,BECKETT>请你去找一下部长
<23-5,BECKETT>Just please get to the secretary.

674
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,210
<23-5,BECKETT>我说了  此事事关国家安全
<23-5,BECKETT>I told you, this is a matter of national--

675
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,800
<23-6,BODYGUARD>-女士  你得退后  -里德部长
<23-6,BODYGUARD>- Ma'am, you need to step back. - Secretary Reed?

676
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,310
<23-7,BECKETT>-里德部长  我是贝克特探员  -退后
<23-7,BECKETT>- Secretary Reed, agent Beckett... - Step back.

00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,270
<23-7,BECKETT>我是司法部长办公室的
<23-7,BECKETT>from the attorney general's office.

678
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,920
<23-7,BECKETT>我们今天早些时候见过  长官
<23-7,BECKETT>We met earlier today, sir.

679
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,290
<23-8,MARY REED>迈克尔  那是谁
<23-8,MARY REED>Michael, who is that?

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,140
<23-10,REED>-我会处理的  -女士  请您退后
<23-10,REED>- I'll take care of it. - Ma'am, you need to step back

<23-11,BECKETT>- to your vehicle right now. - Sir, we just need to speak.

682

<23-11,BECKETT>-此事事关国家安全  -约瑟夫
<23-11,BECKETT>- This is a matter of national security. - Joseph.

683
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,550
<23-12,REED>你居然跑来我家
<23-12,REED>You show up at my home?

684
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,340
<23-12,REED>你以为你是谁啊
<23-12,REED>Who the hell do you think you are?

685
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,870
<23-13,BECKETT>这话该我问你
<23-13,BECKETT>I should ask you the same thing.

686
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,700
<23-13,BECKETT>你对瓦尔基里的事撒谎了
<23-13,BECKETT>You lied about Valkyrie.

687
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,500
<23-13,BECKETT>你妨碍了联邦探员调查案件
<23-13,BECKETT>You obstructed a federal investigation.

688
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,520
<23-14,REED>我对你已经知无不言
<23-14,REED>I told you all you need to know.

689
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,900
<23-15,BECKETT>我要知道一切  到底是怎么回事
<23-15,BECKETT>I need to know everything. What is going on,

690
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,200
<23-15,BECKETT>你到底想隐藏什么
<23-15,BECKETT>and what are you hiding?

691
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,100
<23-16,REED>你找错了人  探员
<23-16,REED>You are barking up the wrong tree, agent,

692
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,960
<23-16,REED>这会让你付出代价
<23-16,REED>And it's gonna cost ya.

693
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,050
<23-17,BECKETT>现在有一种致命毒素流落在外
<23-17,BECKETT>There's a deadly toxin out there.

694
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,530
<23-17,BECKETT>如果因为你不肯合作而死了哪怕一个人
<23-17,BECKETT>If so much as one person dies because you won't cooperate,

695
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,850
<23-17,BECKETT>-那我就  -你能怎么样
<23-17,BECKETT>- Then I- - You'll what?

696
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,100
<23-18,REED>不论这是怎么回事  跟我都毫无关系
<23-18,REED>Look, whatever this is, it has nothing to do with me.

697
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,040
<23-18,REED>别忘了战斗的第一规则
<23-18,REED>You might wanna remember the first rule of combat.

698
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,070
<23-18,REED>不要挑起你无法取胜的战争
<23-18,REED>You don't ever start a war you can't win.

699
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,710
<23-19,BECKETT>说
<23-19,BECKETT>What?

700
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,170
<23-20,ESPOSITO>贝克特  是埃斯波西托和莱恩
<23-20,ESPOSITO>Hey, Beckett. It's, uh, Esposito and Ryan.

701
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,230
<23-20,ESPOSITO>你还好吗
<23-20,ESPOSITO>Is everything okay?

702
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,500
<23-21,BECKETT>好着呢  怎么了
<23-21,BECKETT>Fine. Why?

703
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,210
<23-22,RYAN>卡塞尔的妈妈来过  很担心他
<23-22,RYAN>Castle's mom came by, all worried about him.

704
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,560
<23-23,ESPOSITO>贝克特  说吧  到底怎么回事
<23-23,ESPOSITO>Come on, Beckett. What's going on?

705
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,170
<23-23,ESPOSITO>没事
<23-23,ESPOSITO>Everything's fine.

706
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,000
<24-1,GOLDBERG>用鼻子吸
<24-1,GOLDBERG>Keep taking it in through the nose,

707
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,280
<24-1,GOLDBERG>从嘴呼出
<24-1,GOLDBERG>out through the mouth.

708
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,660
<24-2,CASTLE>谢谢
<24-2,CASTLE>Thank you again.

709
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,470
<24-3,VILANTE>你到底是怎么想的
<24-3,VILANTE>What the hell were you thinking?

710
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,240
<24-4,BECKETT>长官  我只是跟着直觉走
<24-4,BECKETT>Sir, I was just following a hunch.

711
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,090
<24-5,VILANTE>下次  跟着命令走
<24-5,VILANTE>Next time, follow orders.

712
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,660
<24-5,VILANTE>我不得不去与司法部长见面
<24-5,VILANTE>I had to go to the mat with the Attorney General

713
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,620
<24-5,VILANTE>以保住你的职位
<24-5,VILANTE>to keep your job.

714
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,120
<24-6,BECKETT>等等  里德部长向司法部长投诉了
<24-6,BECKETT>Wait. Secretary Reed complained to the Attorney General?

715
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,810
<24-7,VILANTE>如果你感到惊讶  你没我想象得那么聪明
<24-7,VILANTE>If that surprises you, you're not as smart as I thought.

716
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,600
<24-8,BECKETT>不  长官  如果里德是背后主谋
<24-8,BECKETT>No, sir, it's just, if Reed was behind this,

717
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,850
<24-8,BECKETT>他不会打电话的
<24-8,BECKETT>He wouldn't have made that call.

718
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,760
<24-9,VILANTE>没错  因为他不想引火烧身
<24-9,VILANTE>Right, because he wouldn't want to call attention to himself.

719
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,020
<24-9,VILANTE>所以你才会激怒他
<24-9,VILANTE>Is that why you went out there?

720
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,340
<24-9,VILANTE>迫使他有所行动
<24-9,VILANTE>To force him to show his hand?

721
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,230
<24-9,VILANTE>厉害
<24-9,VILANTE>I'm impressed.

722
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,260
<24-9,VILANTE>厉害什么啊
<24-9,VILANTE>Yeah, well, don't be.

723
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,790
<24-10,BECKETT>唯一的嫌疑人被我排除嫌疑了
<24-10,BECKETT>Looks like I just ruled out our only lead.

724
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,350
<24-11,MCCORD>伙计们  我有线索
<24-11,MCCORD>Guys, I got something.

725
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,640
<25-1,MCCORD>我在追查瓦尔基里
<25-1,MCCORD>I was following up on Valkyrie

726
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,910
<25-1,MCCORD>想看看还有没有内幕
<25-1,MCCORD>to see if there was anything more to the story.

727
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,330
<25-1,MCCORD>我们从拉希德那里拿到一张家庭照片
<25-1,MCCORD>This is a family photo we got from Rasheed.

728
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,620
<25-1,MCCORD>他确认这个女人
<25-1,MCCORD>He identified this woman...

729
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,560
<25-1,MCCORD>是布朗森在空袭后
<25-1,MCCORD>as the servant whose body Bronson took

730
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,270
<25-1,MCCORD>带走的女仆
<25-1,MCCORD>after the air strike.

731
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,210
<25-2,MCCORD>我们确认她是法拉赫·乌斯曼
<25-2,MCCORD>And we've identified her as Farrah Usman.

732
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,050
<25-3,HENDRICKS>这里显示她是一名承包商
<25-3,HENDRICKS>She's listed as a civilian contractor

733
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,060
<25-3,HENDRICKS>在喀布尔的美国领事馆工作
<25-3,HENDRICKS>working out of the U.S. Consulate in Kabul.

734
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,940
<25-4,MCCORD>这是情报人员的典型伪装身份
<25-4,MCCORD>It's a typical cover for an intelligence operative.

735
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,360
<25-5,HENDRICKS>她被认为是被路边简易爆炸装置杀死
<25-5,HENDRICKS>Now she was supposedly killed by a roadside I.E.D.

736
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,300
<25-5,HENDRICKS>就是扎瓦利被空袭那晚
<25-5,HENDRICKS>The same night as the Zawari attack.

737
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,430
<25-6,VILANTE>这说得通
<25-6,VILANTE>Well, that makes sense.

738
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,340
<25-6,VILANTE>简易爆炸装置的伤痕与空袭造成的
<25-6,VILANTE>The injuries from an I.E.D. look a lot like those

739
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,260
<25-6,VILANTE>很像
<25-6,VILANTE>from an air strike.

740
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,950
<25-7,MCCORD>那不是关键  看这个
<25-7,MCCORD>That's not the story. Look at this.

741
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,540
<25-7,MCCORD>法拉赫·乌斯曼的尸体
<25-7,MCCORD>So Farrah Usman's body

742
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,350
<25-7,MCCORD>两天后被运回多弗尔[空军基地]
<25-7,MCCORD>was shipped back to dover two days later

743
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,580
<25-7,MCCORD>被这个人认尸
<25-7,MCCORD>and was claimed by this man.

744
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,930
<25-7,MCCORD>认出这个名字了吗
<25-7,MCCORD>You recognize that name?

745
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,900
<25-8,BECKETT>布拉德·帕克  那个记者
<25-8,BECKETT>Brad Parker? The reporter?

746
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,280
<25-9,MCCORD>就是他
<25-9,MCCORD>One and the same.

747
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,140
<25-10,BECKETT>我不明白  他跟瓦尔基里是怎么联系起来的
<25-10,BECKETT>I don't get it. How is he connected to Valkyrie?

748
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,600
<25-11,MCCORD>根据文书显示  他是她的未婚夫
<25-11,MCCORD>According to the paperwork, he was her fiance.

749
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,500
<25-11,MCCORD>他跟这一切都有关
<25-11,MCCORD>He's involved in this whole thing.

750
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,730
<26-1,MCCORD>作为实战老兵  布拉德·帕克知道
<26-1,MCCORD>As a combat vet, Brad Parker would have known

751
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,730
<26-1,MCCORD>他的未婚妻并非死于简易爆炸装置
<26-1,MCCORD>his fiance's injuries weren't from an IED.

752
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,800
<26-2,BECKETT>所以他才会报道梦乡
<26-2,BECKETT>That's why he was doing the story on Dreamworld

753
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,210
<26-2,BECKETT>并找到布朗森
<26-2,BECKETT>and why he tracked down Bronson.

754
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,340
<26-2,BECKETT>他在查明未婚妻丧命的真相
<26-2,BECKETT>He was trying to figure out how she actually died.

755
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,120
<26-3,MCCORD>他是退伍军人
<26-3,MCCORD>And he's ex-military.

756
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,250
<26-3,MCCORD>他有能力完成盗窃
<26-3,MCCORD>He would have had the skills to pull off that heist.

757
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,530
<26-4,VILANTE>也就是说
<26-4,VILANTE>So what are we saying here?

758
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,330
<26-4,VILANTE>帕克因为未婚妻的死偷走毒素
<26-4,VILANTE>That Parker stole the toxin because of his fiance?

759
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,690
<26-4,VILANTE>为了报仇
<26-4,VILANTE>That this is about revenge?

760
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,710
<26-5,CASTLE>毒素是最好的选择
<26-5,CASTLE>Well, the toxin would be perfect for that.

761
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,180
<26-5,CASTLE>致命  通过尸检又查不出来
<26-5,CASTLE>It's deadly and undetectable via autopsy

762
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,980
<26-5,CASTLE>除非你知道你要找什么
<26-5,CASTLE>unless you're specifically looking for it.

763
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,920
<26-6,MCCORD>所以他才会通过制造另一场盗窃案
<26-6,MCCORD>Which is why he tried to hide the fact that it was stolen

764
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,430
<26-6,MCCORD>和陷害布朗森
<26-6,MCCORD>by staging the other theft in the building

765
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,760
<26-6,MCCORD>来掩盖真相
<26-6,MCCORD>and framing Bronson.

766
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,450
<26-7,VILANTE>搜寻帕克  查得怎么样了
<26-7,VILANTE>Where are we on tracking Parker?

767
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,620
<26-8,HENDRICKS>他没上班  一整天没见到人
<26-8,HENDRICKS>He's not at work. No one's seen him all day.

768
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,260
<26-9,RICHMOND>我得不到他的手机讯号
<26-9,RICHMOND>I can't get a trace on his cell signal.

769
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
<26-9,RICHMOND>他一定是关机了
<26-9,RICHMOND>He must have turned it off.

770
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,580
<26-10,BECKETT>长官  哪怕只有一点点机会
<26-10,BECKETT>Sir, if there's the slightest chance...

771
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,390
<26-11,VILANTE>去他的公寓  行动
<26-11,VILANTE>Hit his apartment. Go.

772
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,100
<26-11,VILANTE>卡塞尔
<26-11,VILANTE>Castle.

773
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,640
<26-12,VILLANTE>你待在这
<26-12,VILLANTE>You stay here.

774
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,430
<26-13,CASTLE>我在不到一天之前
<26-13,CASTLE>I was given less than a day to live

775
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,200
<26-13,CASTLE>被告知只有不到一条的生命
<26-13,CASTLE>just a little less than a day ago.

776
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,930
<26-13,CASTLE>如果帕克有解药  我得跟他们一起去
<26-13,CASTLE>If Parker has that antidote, I need to go with them.

777
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,400
<26-14,VILANTE>好吧
<26-14,VILANTE>Okay.

778
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,750
<27-1,AGENT>安全
<27-1,AGENT>Clear!

779
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,290
<27-1,AGENT>卧室安全
<27-1,AGENT>Bedroom's clear!

780
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,460
<27-3,MCCORD>安全  这家伙哪去了
<27-3,MCCORD>Clear. Where the hell is this guy?

781
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,040
<27-4,BECKETT>伙计们  开始工作吧
<27-4,BECKETT>All right, guys, let's get to work.

782
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,800
<27-4,BECKETT>如果毒素或解药在这  给我找出来
<27-4,BECKETT>If that toxin or antidote are in here, I want them found.

783
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,610
<27-5,CASTLE>这些是毒素被偷走大楼
<27-5,CASTLE>These are blueprints of the research building

784
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,080
<27-5,CASTLE>的蓝图
<27-5,CASTLE>the toxin was stolen from.

785
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,740
<27-6,BECKETT>关于毒素的机密文件  帕克就是我们要找的人
<27-6,BECKETT>And a confidential file on the toxin. Parker's our guy.

786
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,510
<27-7,CASTLE>他对里德部长做了背景调查
<27-7,CASTLE>He's got a background on Secretary Reed.

787
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,100
<27-7,CASTLE>研究材料
<27-7,CASTLE>Research materials.

788
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,130
<27-8,BECKETT>里德是他的下个目标
<27-8,BECKETT>Reed's his next target.

789
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,880
<27-8,BECKETT>他要除掉那个下令
<27-8,BECKETT>He's going after the man that gave the order

790
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,380
<27-8,BECKETT>杀死他未婚妻的人
<27-8,BECKETT>that killed his fiance.

791
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,090
<27-9,MCCORD>我想我知道在哪儿
<27-9,MCCORD>And I think I know where.

792
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,320
<27-9,MCCORD>这是帕克参加里德在海军学院在演讲
<27-9,MCCORD>This is confirmation of Parker's press credentials

793
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,210
<27-9,MCCORD>的记者证确认函
<27-9,MCCORD>for Reed's address at the naval academy.

794
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,240
<27-9,MCCORD>里德在今天下午五点要给新生做演讲
<27-9,MCCORD>Reed's talking to new cadets at 5:00 p.m. today.

795
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
<27-11,BECKETT>那在20分钟后  我们得把里德安全保护起来
<27-11,BECKETT>That's in 20 minutes. We gotta lock Reed down.

796
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,360
<27-11,BECKETT>逮住帕克  拿到解药
<27-11,BECKETT>Secure Parker and get that antidote.

797
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,910
<28-1,ADMIRAL JOHNSON>感谢你能来  部长先生
<28-1,ADMIRAL JOHNSON>Thanks for coming, Mr. Secretary.

798
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,940
<28-2,REED>是我的荣幸  约翰逊将军
<28-2,REED>It's my pleasure, Admiral Johnson.

799
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,240
<28-2,REED>能离开办公室挺好的
<28-2,REED>It's nice to get out of the office.

800
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,700
<28-3,JOHNSON>希望你别介意  咱们得先接受媒体采访
<28-3,JOHNSON>Hope you don't mind that we do the press line first.

801
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,980
<28-4,REED>没事的
<28-4,REED>Oh, that's fine.

802
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,280
<28-4,REED>要我联系戈德伯格医生
<28-4,REED>Do we want me to get ahold of Dr. Goldberg

803
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,710
<29-1,BECKETT>让他到那里跟咱们碰面吗
<29-1,BECKETT>and have him meet us there?

804
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,810
<29-2,CASTLE>他已经给我打过最后一针了
<29-2,CASTLE>He already gave me my last shot.

805
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,510
<29-2,CASTLE>现在能帮到我的只有解药
<29-2,CASTLE>The only thing that can help me now is the antidote.

806
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,410
<29-2,CASTLE>海军学院的媒体部
<29-2,CASTLE>Naval Academy's press department

807
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,140
<29-3,MCCORD>说帕克还没有登记
<29-3,MCCORD>says Parker hasn't checked in yet.

808
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,760
<29-4,HENDRICKS>安保人员已经就位找他了
<29-4,HENDRICKS>Security teams are already on site looking for him.

809
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,870
<29-5,BECKETT>收到
<29-5,BECKETT>Copy that.

810
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,820
<29-6,CASTLE>说不通
<29-6,CASTLE>Doesn't make any sense.

811
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,850
<29-6,CASTLE>帕克怎么还没到
<29-6,CASTLE>Why wouldn't Parker be there yet?

812
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,780
<29-7,BECKETT>人很多
<29-7,BECKETT>There's thousands of people there.

813
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,830
<29-7,BECKETT>也许他们还没看到他
<29-7,BECKETT>Maybe they just haven't spotted him yet.

814
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,740
<29-8,CASTLE>如果不用记者证  为什么
<29-8,CASTLE>Why go through the trouble of getting press credentials

815
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,670
<29-8,CASTLE>要大费周章去办理呢
<29-8,CASTLE>if you're not gonna use them?

816
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,870
<29-9,BECKETT>除非他又摆了我们一道
<29-9,BECKETT>Unless he's pulling another head fake.

817
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,650
<29-9,BECKETT>就像加密系统
<29-9,BECKETT>Like the encryption system

818
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,610
<29-9,BECKETT>是为了偷毒素的掩护
<29-9,BECKETT>was a cover for the theft of the toxin.

819
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,270
<29-10,CASTLE>军事策略
<29-10,CASTLE>Military tactics.

820
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,980
<29-10,CASTLE>总是让我们落后一招
<29-10,CASTLE>Always making sure we're a step behind.

821
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,970
<29-10,CASTLE>落后什么
<29-10,CASTLE>A step behind what?

822
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,500
<29-11,BECKETT>我是说这一切是为了复仇
<29-11,BECKETT>I mean, this has to be about revenge,

823
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,150
<29-11,BECKETT>定是冲着里德来的
<29-11,BECKETT>so it has to be about Reed.

824
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,490
<29-12,CASTLE>也许他想以牙还牙  以眼还眼
<29-12,CASTLE>Maybe he wants to do to Reed what Reed did to him--

825
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,940
<29-12,CASTLE>杀死他最爱的人
<29-12,CASTLE>Take away the person he loves the most.

826
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,420
<29-13,BECKETT>他妻子
<29-13,BECKETT>His wife.

827
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,150
<29-14,MCCORD>贝克特  你为什么调头
<29-14,MCCORD>Beckett, why'd you turn around?

828
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,380
<29-14,MCCORD>卡塞尔不行了吗
<29-14,MCCORD>Is it Castle?

829
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,230
<29-15,BECKETT>不  我们有个想法
<29-15,BECKETT>No. We have a hunch.

830
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,830
<29-16,MCCORD>什么想法
<29-16,MCCORD>What kind of hunch?

831
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,170
<29-17,RECEPTIONIST>国防部长里德办公室
<29-17,RECEPTIONIST>Defense Secretary Reed's office.

832
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,820
<29-18,BECKETT>我是贝克特探员
<29-18,BECKETT>This is Agent Beckett

833
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,040
<29-19,RECEPTIONIST>-司法部长调查...  -请稍等
<29-19,RECEPTIONIST>- from the Attorney General's investigative-- - Hold, please.

834
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,430
<29-20,BECKETT>等等  还在吗
<29-20,BECKETT>No, wait. Hello?

835
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,590
<29-20,BECKETT>-凯特  -卡塞尔  坚持住  我们马上到了

900
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,360
<37-24,BECKETT>真抱歉  卡塞尔
<37-24,BECKETT>I'm so sorry, Castle.

901
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,580
<37-24,BECKETT>一切本不应该这么艰难的
<37-24,BECKETT>This wasn't supposed to be this hard.

902
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,480
<37-25,CASTLE>你是指华盛顿的工作还是我们的感情
<37-25,CASTLE>What, Washington or us?

903
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,810
<37-25,CASTLE>有时候
<37-25,CASTLE>Sometimes...

904
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,930
<37-25,CASTLE>生活中最困难的是
<37-25,CASTLE>the hardest things in life...

905
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,620
<37-25,CASTLE>值得做的事
<37-25,CASTLE>are the things most worth doing.

906
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,960
<37-25,CASTLE>就因为我们还没找到解决办法
<37-25,CASTLE>Just because we haven't figured it out yet

907
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,460
<37-25,CASTLE>并不代表我们找不到
<37-25,CASTLE>doesn't mean we won't.

908
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,490
<37-25,CASTLE>不过告诉你
<37-25,CASTLE>Tell you what, though.

909
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,520
<37-25,CASTLE>下次说想死我了
<37-25,CASTLE>Next time I say I'm dying to see you,

910
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,400
<37-25,CASTLE>最好保持在比喻的情况下
<37-25,CASTLE>let's keep it metaphoric.

911
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,720
<37-26,BECKETT>好的
<37-26,BECKETT>Deal.

912
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,900
<38-1,MCCORD>他怎么样
<38-1,MCCORD>How's he doing?

913
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,390
<38-2,BECKETT>考虑到一切  还好
<38-2,BECKETT>He's okay, considering.

914
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,630
<38-2,BECKETT>里德夫人怎么样
<38-2,BECKETT>What about Mrs. Reed?

915
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,260
<38-3,MCCORD>她会没事的
<38-3,MCCORD>Uh, she will pull through.

916
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,470
<38-4,BECKETT>里德部长呢
<38-4,BECKETT>And what about Secretary Reed?

917
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,020
<38-4,BECKETT>他会怎样处置
<38-4,BECKETT>What's gonna happen with him?

918
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,420
<38-5,MCCORD>什么意思
<38-5,MCCORD>What do you mean?

919
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,050
<38-6,BECKETT>他为了保全自己隐瞒了信息
<38-6,BECKETT>He withheld information to save his own ass.

920
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,310
<38-6,BECKETT>有人因此死掉
<38-6,BECKETT>People almost died because of it.

921
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,720
<38-7,MCCORD>事情没那么简单
<38-7,MCCORD>Well, we both know it's not that simple.

922
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,290
<38-8,BECKETT>至少会展开
<38-8,BECKETT>Well... there's gonna be an investigation,

923
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,490
<38-8,BECKETT>调查吧
<38-8,BECKETT>at least, right?

924
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,610
<38-9,MCCORD>你想让一切都黑白分明  我明白
<38-9,MCCORD>You... want everything to be black or white. I get it.

925
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,280
<38-9,MCCORD>但在华府
<38-9,MCCORD>But... in this town,

926
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,130
<38-9,MCCORD>事情总是处在灰色地带  做这份工作
<38-9,MCCORD>it rarely is, and to do this job,

927
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,030
<38-9,MCCORD>你得去接受这一点
<38-9,MCCORD>you have to make peace with that.

928
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,400
<38-10,MCCORD>但是
<38-10,MCCORD>But hey...

929
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,230
<38-10,MCCORD>帕克会对里德夫人下手  真是超赞的判断
<38-10,MCCORD>That was a hell of a hunch about Mrs. Reed.

930
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,080
<38-11,MCCORD>你该为自己骄傲
<38-11,MCCORD>You should feel really good about this.

931
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,770
<38-12,BECKETT>那是卡塞尔的想法
<38-12,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that was Castle.

932
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,890
<38-13,MCCORD>但是你很明智地按直觉行动
<38-13,MCCORD>But you were smart enough to act on it.

933
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,210
<38-13,MCCORD>那是你的判断
<38-13,MCCORD>That was your call.

934
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,760
<38-14,BECKETT>而你在不知道我怎么行动的情况下就后援了
<38-14,BECKETT>And you backed me up without even knowing my play.

935
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,160
<38-15,MCCORD>那是搭档该做的
<38-15,MCCORD>That's what partners do.

936
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,910
<38-15,MCCORD>是啊
<38-15,MCCORD>Yeah.

937
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,700
<38-15,MCCORD>那是搭档该做的
<38-15,MCCORD>That's what partners do.
