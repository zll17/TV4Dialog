7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,840
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>来点甜蜜的我不介意
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>I sure could go for something sweet.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,260
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>你要吃点什么吗
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>Do you want to grab a bite to eat?

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,430
<1-3,CASTLE>我想要的甜蜜不是吃的
<1-3,CASTLE>Actually, it's not food that I'm craving.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,930
<1-5,CASTLE>怎么了
<1-5,CASTLE>What? Is it...

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,720
<1-6,BECKETT>不不  没什么
<1-6,BECKETT>No, no. It's nothing.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,440
<1-7,CASTLE>不  我恰好是"没什么"专家
<1-7,CASTLE>No, no. I happen to be an expert on nothing.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,720
<1-7,CASTLE>这个表情  可不是没什么
<1-7,CASTLE>And this. This is not nothing.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,880
<1-8,BECKETT>好吧
<1-8,BECKETT>Okay. Fine.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,240
<1-8,BECKETT>-你知道你会说梦话对吗  -嗯
<1-8,BECKETT>- Do you know how you talk in your sleep sometimes? - Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,320
<1-10,BECKETT>昨晚你说了个名字
<1-10,BECKETT>Well, last night you said a name.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,100
<1-11,CASTLE>我猜不是你的名字
<1-11,CASTLE>Oh... and not your name I'm assuming.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,810
<1-12,BECKETT>不是
<1-12,BECKETT>No.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,320
<1-13,CASTLE>随便说了个名字  别多想嘛
<1-13,CASTLE>Well, I wouldn't read anything into one random utterance.

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,800
<1-14,BECKETT>说了14遍
<1-14,BECKETT>14 utterances.

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,060
<1-14,BECKETT>名字是乔丹
<1-14,BECKETT>And the name was Jordan.

22
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,580
<1-14,BECKETT>你说了一遍又一遍
<1-14,BECKETT>You said it over and over again.

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,000
<2-1,BECKETT>乔丹是谁
<2-1,BECKETT>Who's Jordan?

24
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,270
<1-15,CASTLE>我不知道
<1-15,CASTLE>I have no idea.

25
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:56,990
<1-16,BECKETT>是女人吗
<1-16,BECKETT>Is it a woman?

26
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,120
<1-17,CASTLE>不  没什么
<1-17,CASTLE>No, it's nothing.

27
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,390
<1-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我知道"没什么"
<1-18,BECKETT>Castle, I know nothing.

28
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,040
<1-18,BECKETT>"没什么"是我亲爱的朋友
<1-18,BECKETT>Nothing is a dear friend of mine.

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,550
<1-18,BECKETT>这个可不是"没什么"
<1-18,BECKETT>And this. This is not nothing.

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,420
<1-19,CASTLE>是没什么  而且
<1-19,CASTLE>Yes, it is. Besides...

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
<1-19,CASTLE>我大多数的话都毫无意义
<1-19,CASTLE>Most of what I say is meaningless.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,640
<1-19,CASTLE>更何况是梦话呢
<1-19,CASTLE>Why would it be any different when I'm asleep?

33
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,300
<1-20,BECKETT>这事没完
<1-20,BECKETT>We're not done here.

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,550
<2-1,BECKETT>得了  卡塞尔  乔丹是谁
<2-1,BECKETT>Come on, castle. Who is Jordan?

35
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,070
<2-2,CASTLE>我没什么可隐瞒的  本来就没什么可说的
<2-2,CASTLE>I got nothing to hide. There's just nothing to tell.

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,820
<2-3,BECKETT>那你怎么这么戒备
<2-3,BECKETT>Then why are you being so defensive?

37
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,860
<2-4,CASTLE>我没有
<2-4,CASTLE>I'm not.

38
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,350
<2-4,CASTLE>好吧
<2-4,CASTLE>Okay, fine.

39
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,270
<2-5,BECKETT>那我等到你睡着好了
<2-5,BECKETT>I'll just wait until you're asleep.

40
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,730
<2-5,BECKETT>然后我再问你
<2-5,BECKETT>And then I'll ask you.

41
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,190
<2-6,CASTLE>你不能这样做
<2-6,CASTLE>You can't do that.

42
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,660
<3-1,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  你才说你没什么可隐瞒的
<3-1,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. You just said that you had nothing to hide.

43
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,170
<3-2,CASTLE>在我睡着时审问我
<3-2,CASTLE>Yeah, but interrogating me in my sleep?

44
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,490
<3-2,CASTLE>你会用这么卑鄙的招数吗
<3-2,CASTLE>Would you stoop that low?

45
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,150
<3-3,BECKETT>谁说我没用过
<3-3,BECKETT>Who says I haven't already?

46
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,610
<3-4,BECKETT>早啊  蕾妮
<3-4,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie.

47
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,710
<3-6,CASTLE>哇  真是死在巧克力上啊
<3-6,CASTLE>Wow. Talk about death by chocolate.

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,620
<3-7,LANIE>不关巧克力的事  卡塞尔
<3-7,LANIE>Don't blame it on the chocolate, castle.

49
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,030
<3-7,LANIE>死因是子弹
<3-7,LANIE>A bullet's what did him in.

50
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,880
<3-8,CASTLE>那红色的不是覆盆子酱喽
<3-8,CASTLE>So that red stuff's not raspberry sauce?

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,640
<3-9,LANIE>恐怕不是  子弹射出伤
<3-9,LANIE>Afraid not. Exit wound.

52
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,180
<3-10,BECKETT>那么他是背后中枪然后跌进桶里
<3-10,BECKETT>So he was shot in the back and then fell in the mixer?

53
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,910
<3-11,LANIE>看起来是的  但在那之前
<3-11,LANIE>Looks like, but before that,

54
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,920
<3-11,LANIE>他可能和凶手搏斗过
<3-11,LANIE>he may have struggled with his attacker.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,990
<3-11,LANIE>米黄色纤维
<3-11,LANIE>Beige fibers--

56
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,540
<3-11,LANIE>在他的表带上发现的
<3-11,LANIE>They were caught on his watchband.

57
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,080
<3-11,LANIE>鉴证组会拿去分析
<3-11,LANIE>C.S.U. will run an analysis.

58
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,540
<3-12,JAVIER EPSPOSITO>被害人叫吉米·韦兰  这家店的老板
<3-12,JAVIER EPSPOSITO>Vic's name is Jimmy Whelan. He's the owner of the shop.

59
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,670
<3-12,JAVIER EPSPOSITO>他没有前科
<3-12,JAVIER EPSPOSITO>He has no record...

60
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,380
<3-12,JAVIER EPSPOSITO>从背景资料中也看不出谁可能是凶手
<3-12,JAVIER EPSPOSITO>And nothing in his bio that points to who did this.

61
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,160
<3-13,CASTLE>可以排除不满意的顾客
<3-13,CASTLE>You can rule out dissatisfied customers.

62
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,500
<3-13,CASTLE>这些东西太好吃了
<3-13,CASTLE>These things are insanely good.

63
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,430
<3-14,LANIE>你居然吃死人的纸杯蛋糕
<3-14,LANIE>You're eating a dead man's cupcake?

64
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,430
<3-15,CASTLE>那边有免费样品
<3-15,CASTLE>There was free samples.

65
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,870
<3-16,BECKETT>死亡时间
<3-16,BECKETT>Time of death?

66
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,300
<3-17,ESPOSITO>11点半到12点
<3-17,ESPOSITO>Between 11:30 and 12:00.

67
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,980
<3-18,LANIE>怎么看出来的
<3-18,LANIE>Based on what?

68
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,990
<3-18,LANIE>你一下子成了法医吗
<3-18,LANIE>All of a sudden, you're an M.E.?

69
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,310
<3-19,ESPOSITO>你不是喜欢我扮医生吗
<3-19,ESPOSITO>I thought you liked it when I played doctor.

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,450
<3-20,ESPOSITO>这样说的依据是
<3-20,ESPOSITO>I, uh, based the time of death on what

71
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,720
<3-20,ESPOSITO>死者助手的话
<3-20,ESPOSITO>the vic's assistant told me.

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,900
<3-20,ESPOSITO>就在那边
<3-20,ESPOSITO>Right over there.

73
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,670
<4-1,BECKETT>托德  告诉我们发生了什么事
<4-1,BECKETT>Okay, Todd, why don't you just run us through what happened?

74
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,940
<4-2,TODD>吉米让我11点半去送货
<4-2,TODD>Jimmy sent me on a delivery at 11:30--

75
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,620
<4-2,TODD>送一打红丝绒蛋糕到路口的美容院
<4-2,TODD>A dozen red velvets to a beauty shop down the way.

76
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,260
<4-2,TODD>我回来后发现
<4-2,TODD>And when I came back...

77
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,940
<4-2,TODD>吉米是个非常好的人
<4-2,TODD>He's a super-nice guy-- Jimmy.

78
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,570
<4-3,CASTLE>他认识的人中有没有不这么想的
<4-3,CASTLE>Well, is there anyone in his life who didn't feel that way?

79
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,540
<4-4,TODD>我不清楚
<4-4,TODD>I'm not sure.

80
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,480
<4-4,TODD>我才在这里工作两周
<4-4,TODD>The truth is, this is only my second week here.

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,310
<4-4,TODD>但我离开前他的表现很奇怪
<4-4,TODD>But he was acting real strange right before I left.

82
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,470
<4-5,BECKETT>怎么奇怪
<4-5,BECKETT>Strange how?

83
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,010
<4-6,TODD>店外有辆徘徊的车
<4-6,TODD>This car... cruised by the shop,

84
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,120
<4-6,TODD>开得很慢
<4-6,TODD>kinda slow.

85
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,640
<4-6,TODD>他变得紧张
<4-6,TODD>He got all nervous.

86
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,260
<4-6,TODD>那时他就让我离开
<4-6,TODD>That's when he sent me on my run,

87
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,660
<4-6,TODD>好像是故意要支开我
<4-6,TODD>like he wanted to get rid of me.

88
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,410
<4-7,BECKETT>什么样的车
<4-7,BECKETT>What kind of car was it?

89
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,640
<4-8,TODD>黑色的68年道奇突击者
<4-8,TODD>It was a black '68 charger r/t.

90
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,390
<4-8,TODD>我比较懂大马力车
<4-8,TODD>I know my muscle cars.

91
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,530
<4-9,CASTLE>看到司机了吗
<4-9,CASTLE>Did you see who was driving?

92
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,600
<4-10,TODD>没  我离开时  司机把车停到了街角
<4-10,TODD>No, but whoever it was parked it around the corner as I was leaving.

93
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,790
<4-10,TODD>我回来后  车开走了
<4-10,TODD>When I got back, the car was gone,

94
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,900
<4-10,TODD>吉米死了
<4-10,TODD>And there was Jimmy.

95
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,690
<4-11,BECKETT>我们需要那辆车的详细描述
<4-11,BECKETT>Well, we'll need a detailed description of that car.

96
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,520
<4-12,ESPOSITO>看来吉米放了不少现金[面团]啊
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Looks like Jimmy kept a lot of dough around here.

97
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,810
<4-13,CASTLE>这里是西点店嘛
<4-13,CASTLE>It is a bakery.

98
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
<4-14,ESPOSITO>真好笑
<4-14,ESPOSITO>Good one.

99
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,980
<4-14,ESPOSITO>箱子是在他办公室找到的
<4-14,ESPOSITO>This briefcase was stashed in his office.

100
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,310
<4-14,ESPOSITO>五万现金
<4-14,ESPOSITO>That's $50,000.

101
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,750
<4-15,CASTLE>四块钱一个蛋糕
<4-15,CASTLE>Whoa. At $4 a pop,

102
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,070
<4-15,CASTLE>得卖12500个
<4-15,CASTLE>he would have to sell 12,500 cupcakes.

103
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,080
<4-15,CASTLE>听起来不太可能
<4-15,CASTLE>That seems unlikely.

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,490
<4-16,BECKETT>托德  你知道这笔钱吗
<4-16,BECKETT>Todd, what do you know about that money?

105
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,940
<4-17,TODD>不知道  我发誓
<4-17,TODD>Nothing. I swear.

106
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,770
<4-17,TODD>但他对这个箱子非常紧张
<4-17,TODD>But he's real paranoid about that case.

107
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,370
<4-17,TODD>一周两次  他会从保险柜里拿出来
<4-17,TODD>Twice a week, he'd take it out of the safe

108
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,260
<4-17,TODD>带去斯坦顿岛
<4-17,TODD>and take it with him down to staten island.

109
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,400
<4-19,TODD>-去做什么  -他说在那里有生意
<4-19,TODD>- What for? - Just said he had business there.

110
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,030
<4-20,BECKETT>显然吉米做的不仅仅是纸杯蛋糕的生意
<4-20,BECKETT>Well, obviously Jimmy was into more than just baking cupcakes.

111
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,020
<4-20,BECKETT>调查市内所有
<4-20,BECKETT>So let's look at all the owners

112
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,850
<4-20,BECKETT>68年道奇突击者车的车主
<4-20,BECKETT>of '68 chargers in the metro area.

113
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,020
<4-21,ESPOSITO>没问题
<4-21,ESPOSITO>You got it.

114
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,030
<4-22,CASTLE>莱恩在哪里
<4-22,CASTLE>Hey, where's Ryan?

115
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,990
<4-22,CASTLE>对了
<4-22,CASTLE>Oh, right.

116
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,930
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>和罗森伯格医生约在20分钟后
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>The appointment at dr. Rosenberg's office is in 20 minutes.

117
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,730
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>要15分钟才能到
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>It's gonna take us at least 15 to get there,

118
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,250
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>我们应该出发了
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>So we should probably go, right?

119
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,490
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>这就是说你应该
<5-1,JENNY RYAN>Which means you should probably...

120
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,920
<5-2,JENNY>怎么了
<5-2,JENNY>Hey, what's the matter?

121
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,790
<5-3,KEVIN RYAN>如果是我的问题呢
<5-3,KEVIN RYAN>What if it's my fault?

122
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,270
<5-3,KEVIN RYAN>如果结果是我有什么问题呢

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,810
<6-1,CASTLE>还要秘密前往斯坦顿岛
<6-1,CASTLE>and why the secret trips to staten island?

133
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,300
<6-2,BECKETT>听起来有秘密的不止你一个人  卡塞尔
<6-2,BECKETT>Sounds like you're not the only one keeping secrets, Castle.

134
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,780
<6-3,CASTLE>我准备忽略这句话
<6-3,CASTLE>I'm going to ignore that.

135
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,000
<6-4,BECKETT>这很奇怪
<6-4,BECKETT>That's peculiar.

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
<6-5,CASTLE>这有什么好奇怪的
<6-5,CASTLE>What's so peculiar about wanting to ignore--

00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,940
<6-7,CASTLE>我好像没见过那东西
<6-7,CASTLE>I don't remember seeing that.

142
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,970
<6-8,BECKETT>因为根本就没有
<6-8,BECKETT>That's because there wasn't one.

143
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,320
<6-8,BECKETT>他厨房根本就放不下
<6-8,BECKETT>It wouldn't even fit in his kitchen.

144
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,180
<6-9,ESPOSITO>我查过那辆道奇车
<6-9,ESPOSITO>Yo. So I ran '68 chargers.

145
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,350
<6-9,ESPOSITO>城里只有几辆这款车  不过听好了
<6-9,ESPOSITO>There's only a handful of them on the road, but get this.

146
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,660
<6-9,ESPOSITO>其中有一辆在罗伯特·S·珊农名下
<6-9,ESPOSITO>One of 'em is registered to a Robert S. Shannon,

147
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,850

148
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,810
<6-9,ESPOSITO>他是斯塔顿岛爱尔兰黑帮的首脑
<6-9,ESPOSITO>He's a shot caller for the Irish mob over in Staten Island.

149
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,520
<6-9,ESPOSITO>也是个心狠手辣的王八蛋
<6-9,ESPOSITO>He's a ruthless son of a bitch, too--

150
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
<6-9,ESPOSITO>贩毒  袭击他人
<6-9,ESPOSITO>drug trafficking, assaults.

<6-9,ESPOSITO>他是斯塔顿岛内一半凶杀案的嫌疑人
<6-9,ESPOSITO>He's suspected of half a dozen murders over in Staten Island.

152
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,240
<6-10,CASTLE>等一下  偷偷去斯塔顿岛
<6-10,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Secret trips to Staten Island,

153
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,290
<6-10,CASTLE>和那么多的钱
<6-10,CASTLE>all that cash...

154
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,600
<6-10,CASTLE>如果这个蛋糕店是黑帮洗钱的地方呢
<6-10,CASTLE>What if the cupcake shop is actually a mob front?

155
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,580
<6-10,CASTLE>蛋糕师吉米·韦兰
<6-10,CASTLE>Jimmy Whelan the baker

156
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,480
<6-10,CASTLE>其实是洗钱师吉米·韦兰
<6-10,CASTLE>is actually Jimmy Whelan the money launderer.

157
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,370
<6-10,CASTLE>鲍比·S可能跟他闹了别扭
<6-10,CASTLE>Bobby S. could've had a falling out with him,

158
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,280
<6-10,CASTLE>所以就把他弄死了
<6-10,CASTLE>could've whacked him.

159
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,760
<6-11,BECKETT>也许吧  但我们需要更多证据
<6-11,BECKETT>Maybe, but we're gonna need more

160
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,130
<6-11,BECKETT>不能因为他的车出现在犯罪现场
<6-11,BECKETT>than just his car at the crime scene

161
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,370
<6-11,BECKETT>就把他和谋杀连在一起
<6-11,BECKETT>to connect him to that murder.

162
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,250
<6-12,ESPOSITO>也许有人能帮我们

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,350
<9-6,CASTLE>他们  看  珍妮生气了
<9-6,CASTLE>They--ooh. Look, Jenny's pissed.

249
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,450
<9-7,BECKETT>这很正常
<9-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, it's not surprising

250
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,910
<9-7,BECKETT>当你发现你的另一半也藏着秘密的时候
<9-7,BECKETT>when you find out someone you're in a relationship with

251
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,810
<9-7,BECKETT>你也会生气
<9-7,BECKETT>is keeping a secret.

252
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,730
<9-8,CASTLE>我
<9-8,CASTLE>I...

253
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,650
<9-9,CASTLE>淡定  他出来了
<9-9,CASTLE>Be cool. Here he comes.

254
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,830
<9-10,CASTLE>自然点  自然点
<9-10,CASTLE>Act normal. Act normal.

255
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,460
<9-11,ESPOSITO>很自然啊
<9-11,ESPOSITO>I am. This is normal.

256
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,820
<9-12,CASTLE>该死
<9-12,CASTLE>Damn.

257
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,080
<9-12,CASTLE>鲍比·S
<9-12,CASTLE>Bobby S.

258
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,930
<9-13,RYAN>你们觉得是他
<9-13,RYAN>Are we thinking that this guy

259
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,120
<9-13,RYAN>除掉了吉米·韦兰吗
<9-13,RYAN>is the one that took out Jimmy Whelan?

260
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,060
<9-14,BECKETT>等下  你认识鲍比·S
<9-14,BECKETT>Wait. You know Bobby S.?

261
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,940
<9-15,RYAN>我们以前是朋友
<9-15,RYAN>Yeah, we were friends back in the day.

262
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,910
<9-16,ESPOSITO>你和这种混蛋是朋友  怎么回事
<9-16,ESPOSITO>You were friends with this lowlife? How's that?

263
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,470
<9-17,RYAN>我们以前在一个帮派里
<9-17,RYAN>We used to run in the same crew.

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,270
<9-17,RYAN>进凶案组之前
<9-17,RYAN>I was undercover for 14 months

265
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,800
<9-17,RYAN>我做过14个月的卧底
<9-17,RYAN>before I joined homicide.

266
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,200
<9-18,BECKETT>你在斯塔顿岛做过卧底
<9-18,BECKETT>You were undercover on Staten Island?

267
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,380
<9-19,CASTLE>在爱尔兰黑帮
<9-19,CASTLE>With the Irish mob?

268
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,590
<9-20,RYAN>是  关于鲍比·S我们还知道什么
<9-20,RYAN>Yeah. So what do we got on Bobby S.?

269
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,530
<9-21,ESPOSITO>等等  等等
<9-21,ESPOSITO>No. Hold on. Hold on.

270
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,050
<9-21,ESPOSITO>继续前几句话
<9-21,ESPOSITO>Just go back for a second, please.

271
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,290
<9-21,ESPOSITO>你在那里卧底
<9-21,ESPOSITO>You were undercover?

272
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,220
<9-21,ESPOSITO>在那和雪芳...
<9-21,ESPOSITO>That's where you and Siobhan used to--

273
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,660
<9-22,RYAN>这件事很复杂
<9-22,RYAN>It's complicated.

274
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,880
<9-23,CASTLE>我就喜欢复杂
<9-23,CASTLE>I love complicated.

275
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,360
<9-24,RYAN>雪芳和这件案子有什么关系
<9-24,RYAN>How is Siobhan connected to all this?

276
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,510
<9-25,BECKETT>她认识死者
<9-25,BECKETT>She knows the vic.

277
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,340
<9-25,BECKETT>显然还认识鲍比·S
<9-25,BECKETT>And she knows Bobby S., obviously.

278
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,950
<9-25,BECKETT>但她不肯开口合作
<9-25,BECKETT>But she's not talking.

279
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,580
<9-26,RYAN>或许她会愿意告诉我
<9-26,RYAN>Maybe she'll talk to me.

280
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,680
<10-1,SIOBHAN>我猜你的真名不是费顿·奥康纳咯
<10-1,SIOBHAN>So I guess it's not Fenton O'Connell.

281
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,430
<10-2,RYAN>是凯文  凯文·莱恩
<10-2,RYAN>It's Kevin. Kevin Ryan.

282
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,880
<10-3,SIOBHAN>至少你是爱尔兰裔
<10-3,SIOBHAN>Well, at least you're Irish.

283
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,870
<10-3,SIOBHAN>关于这一点你没有撒谎
<10-3,SIOBHAN>You didn't lie about that.

284
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,120
<10-4,RYAN>很多事我都撒谎了
<10-4,RYAN>I lied about a lot of things.

285
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,910
<10-5,SIOBHAN>他们说你躲起来了
<10-5,SIOBHAN>They said you went into hiding.

286
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,490
<10-5,SIOBHAN>七年来杳无音信
<10-5,SIOBHAN>Seven years without a word.

287
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,260
<10-6,RYAN>是啊  我知道
<10-6,RYAN>Yeah, I know.

288
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,680
<10-7,SIOBHAN>你什么都不知道
<10-7,SIOBHAN>You do not know.

289
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,220
<10-8,RYAN>相信我  我也不想走的
<10-8,RYAN>Believe me, I didn't want to go.

290
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,360
<10-9,SIOBHAN>省省吧
<10-9,SIOBHAN>Spare me.

291
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,960
<10-9,SIOBHAN>你甚至都没种当面告诉我
<10-9,SIOBHAN>You didn't even have the guts to tell me to my face.

292
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,060
<10-9,SIOBHAN>只在梳妆台上留了一张纸条
<10-9,SIOBHAN>Just a note on the dresser.

293
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,320
<10-10,RYAN>雪芳  我知道你很生气
<10-10,RYAN>Siobhan, I know you're angry.

294
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,180
<10-10,RYAN>但如果你陷入了麻烦
<10-10,RYAN>But if you're in trouble,

295
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,520
<10-10,RYAN>如果你知道鲍比·S跟凶案有关
<10-10,RYAN>if you know something about Bobby S. killing this guy,

296
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,500
<11-1,ESPOSITO>告诉我
<11-1,ESPOSITO>tell me.

297
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,730
<10-10,RYAN>让我帮你
<10-10,RYAN>Let me help you.

298
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,870
<10-11,SIOBHAN>你去死吧
<10-11,SIOBHAN>You can go straight to hell,

299
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,220
<10-11,SIOBHAN>臭条子
<10-11,SIOBHAN>Cop.

300
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
<11-1,ESPOSITO>做卧底
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Deep cover?

301
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,980
<11-1,ESPOSITO>他居然没告诉过我
<11-1,ESPOSITO>I can't believe he didn't tell me.

302
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,780
<11-2,BECKETT>埃斯波  他甚至都没告诉珍妮
<11-2,BECKETT>Espo, he didn't even tell Jenny.

303
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,830
<11-3,ESPOSITO>但我是他的好兄弟  她只是妻子罢了
<11-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but I'm his best friend. She's just the wife.

304
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,830
<11-4,BECKETT>就是因为这种思想  你才一直打光棍
<11-4,BECKETT>Thus proving why there is no Mrs. Esposito.

305
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,440
<11-5,ESPOSITO>那是因为很难找到配得上我的女人
<11-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, it's hard to find a woman for this much man.

306
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,830
<11-6,BECKETT>谈得怎么样
<11-6,BECKETT>So how'd it go?

307
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,010
<11-6,BECKETT>没成功
<11-6,BECKETT>It didn't.

308
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,290
<11-7,RYAN>那么
<11-7,RYAN>So, uh,

309
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,350
<11-7,RYAN>我们推测鲍比杀这家伙的动机是什么
<11-7,RYAN>what do we think Bobby's motive was for killing this guy?

310
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,250
<11-7,RYAN>我们不知道
<11-7,RYAN>We don't know.

311
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,400
<11-8,BECKETT>但似乎他们为了什么事闹掰了
<11-8,BECKETT>But it seems like the two of them had a falling out of some sort.

312
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,120
<11-9,AGENT SAM WALKER>是啊  可以这么说
<11-9,AGENT SAM WALKER>Yeah, you could put it that way.

313
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,750
<11-10,BECKETT>请问你是哪位
<11-10,BECKETT>And you are?

314
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,880
<11-11,AGENT WALKER>联调局特别探员萨姆·沃克
<11-11,AGENT WALKER>Special agent Sam Walker, FBI.

315
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,800
<11-12,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长
<11-12,BECKETT>I'm detective Beckett.

316
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,690
<11-12,BECKETT>这是莱恩和埃斯波西托警探
<11-12,BECKETT>This is detective Ryan and Esposito.

317
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,590
<11-13,AGENT WALKER>莱恩  凯文·莱恩
<11-13,AGENT WALKER>Ryan? Kevin Ryan?

318
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,640
<7-5,SIOBHAN>-你听说过他  -当然了
<7-5,SIOBHAN>- You've heard of him? - Yeah, of course.

319
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,630
<11-15,AGENT WALKER>这家伙带着窃听器潜入爱尔兰黑帮团伙
<11-15,AGENT WALKER>This man got inside the Irish mob with a wire

320
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,890
<11-15,AGENT WALKER>其他人都做不到
<11-15,AGENT WALKER>when no one else could.

321
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,180
<11-15,AGENT WALKER>你帮我们抓获了斯坦顿岛上一半的帮派成员
<11-15,AGENT WALKER>You helped put away half the crew in Staten Island.

322
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,070
<11-16,RYAN>只可惜野火烧不尽啊
<11-16,RYAN>Too bad the weeds grew back, huh?

323
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,340
<11-17,AGENT WALKER>他们向来如此
<11-17,AGENT WALKER>They always do.

324
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,170
<11-18,BECKETT>联调局为什么对我们的凶案调查感兴趣
<11-18,BECKETT>So what's the FBI's interest in our murder investigation?

325
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,360
<11-19,AGENT WALKER>你们的被害人吉米·韦兰
<11-19,AGENT WALKER>Your victim--Jimmy Whelan.

326
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,060
<11-19,AGENT WALKER>他是我的线人
<11-19,AGENT WALKER>He was my informant.

327
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,660
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>吉米本来安分地经营着小店
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>Jimmy was just running his shop,

328
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>勉强度日
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>trying to get by,

329
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,460
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>但后来经济严重滑坡
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>but then when the economy turned,

330
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,550
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>他借了高利贷
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>he borrowed some hard money,

331
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,420
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>那之后  鲍比·S就控制住他了
<12-1,AGENT WALKER>And after that, Bobby S. owned him.

332
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,890
<12-2,RYAN>那么吉米在向你报告鲍比的生意往来吗
<12-2,RYAN>So Jimmy was feeding you intel on Bobby's operations.

333
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,640
<12-3,AGENT WALKER>不仅如此
<12-3,AGENT WALKER>No, more than that.

334
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,470
<12-3,AGENT WALKER>他本来要帮助我们得到那本帮派"圣经"的
<12-3,AGENT WALKER>He was gonna help us get the crew's bible.

335
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,540
<12-4,RYAN>那本"圣经"
<12-4,RYAN>The bible?

336
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,460
<12-5,BECKETT>我想你们说的一定不是那本圣书吧
<12-5,BECKETT>I'm guessing we're not talking about the holy book.

337
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,440
<12-6,RYAN>不  是帮派成员的叫法
<12-6,RYAN>No, it was just something the crew called it.

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,860
<12-6,RYAN>是一份记载了多年交易和联络人的清单
<12-6,RYAN>It's a list of transactions and contacts going back years.

339
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,390
<12-6,RYAN>拿到那本圣经  就可以扳倒整个犯罪团伙
<12-6,RYAN>You get that bible, you'll take down the whole crew.

340
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,300
<12-7,ESPOSITO>现在吉米死了  你又得从头开始了
<12-7,ESPOSITO>So now that Jimmy's gone, you're back to square one.

341
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,690
<12-8,AGENT WALKER>差不多吧  不过我们还有雪芳
<12-8,AGENT WALKER>Pretty much, though we still have Siobhan.

342
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,360
<12-9,BECKETT>不好意思   我没听明白
<12-9,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I don't understand.

343
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,680
<12-10,AGENT WALKER>她也是我的线人
<12-10,AGENT WALKER>She's my informant, too.

344
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,080
<12-11,RYAN>什么  雪芳是不会告密的
<12-11,RYAN>What? Siobhan wouldn't snitch.

345
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,450
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>过去的雪芳或许不会
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>Maybe not the old Siobhan.

346
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,950
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>但事实上  你走后
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>But the truth is, once you left,

347
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,360
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>她很难过
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>she fell on hard times.

348
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,870
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>帮派成员都在她的酒吧喝酒
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>The crew drinks at her bar.

349
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,660
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>他们跟她聊天  信任她
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>They talk to her. They trust her.

350
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,860
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>鲍比·S甚至在她地下室设了一个办公室
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>Bobby S. even keeps an office in the basement.

351
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,590
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>她想挣脱出来时  我们提出了一项交易
<12-12,AGENT WALKER>So when she wanted out, we made an offer.

352
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,920
<12-13,RYAN>什么交易  证人保护计划吗
<12-13,RYAN>For what, witness protection?

353
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,890
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>是的  前提是她帮我们扳倒黑帮
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>Yeah, if she helps us bring down the crew.

354
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,520
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>她的出路就是帮我们拿到那本"圣经"
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>Helping us get the bible, that was gonna be her ticket.

355
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,590
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>直到鲍比发现吉米是个内奸
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>Well, until Bobby S. figured out that Jimmy was a rat

356
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,750
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>并且将他杀害了
<12-14,AGENT WALKER>and had him killed.

357
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,110
<12-15,BECKETT>她打电话给吉米就是为这事吗  提醒他
<12-15,BECKETT>So that's why she called Jimmy, to warn him?

358
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,930
<12-15,BECKETT>是的
<12-15,BECKETT>Yeah.

359
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,820
<12-16,AGENT WALKER>吉米自认为能说通鲍比
<12-16,AGENT WALKER>Jimmy thought he could talk his way out of it.

360
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,510
<12-16,AGENT WALKER>但显然  他失败了
<12-16,AGENT WALKER>Of course, he couldn't.

361
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,480
<12-17,RYAN>雪芳现在要怎么办
<12-17,RYAN>So what happens to Siobhan now?

362
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,300
<12-18,AGENT WALKER>她必须回去
<12-18,AGENT WALKER>She goes back in.

363
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,890
<12-18,AGENT WALKER>不行
<12-18,AGENT WALKER>She can't.

364
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,070
<12-19,RYAN>现在不行
<12-19,RYAN>Not now. I--

365
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,380
<12-19,RYAN>那太危险了
<12-19,RYAN>It's too dangerous.

366
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,740
<12-20,AGENT WALKER>她很清楚要面临的风险
<12-20,AGENT WALKER>She knows the risks.

367
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,940
<12-21,BECKETT>沃克探员  如果我们能发现她和吉米的联系
<12-21,BECKETT>Agent Walker, if we linked her to Jimmy,

368
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,400
<12-21,BECKETT>那鲍比·S也能发现
<12-21,BECKETT>Then Bobby S. can, too.

369
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,090
<12-22,AGENT WALKER>听着  雪芳可以选择抽身
<12-22,AGENT WALKER>Look, Siobhan is free to walk away.

370
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,280
<12-23,RYAN>去哪呢
<12-23,RYAN>And go where?

371
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,470
<12-23,RYAN>谁都别想轻易摆脱鲍比·S
<12-23,RYAN>You don't just walk away from Bobby S.

372
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,920
<12-23,RYAN>大家都知道那一点  他一定不会放过她的
<12-23,RYAN>Everybody knows that. He's gonna hunt her down.

373
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,020
<12-23,RYAN>你必须把她加入证人保护计划
<12-23,RYAN>You have to put her in witness protection.

374
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,780
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>拿到"圣经"后当然可以
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>Yeah, for the bible, sure.

375
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,750
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>但证人保护计划不是什么福利项目
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>But witness protection isn't some entitlement program.

376
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,510
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>雪芳必须自己争取
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>Siobhan has to earn it.

377
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,850
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>失陪了
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>Excuse me.

378
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,250
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>我需要立刻和她见面
<12-24,AGENT WALKER>I need to meet with her now.

379
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,840
<12-25,RYAN>联调局的人要置她的生死于不顾
<12-25,RYAN>The feds are hanging her out to dry.

380
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,520
<12-25,RYAN>鲍比一旦发现  肯定会杀了她的
<12-25,RYAN>And when Bobby finds out, he'll kill her for sure.

381
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,590
<12-25,RYAN>听着  雪芳
<12-25,RYAN>Look, Siobhan,

382
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,180
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>现在最重要的是不要慌张
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>The main thing is not to panic.

383
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,860
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>千万别做任何可能引起怀疑的事
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>You don't want to do anything that might arouse suspicion.

384
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,970
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>低调一段时间  你会没事的
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>Just keep your head down for a while. You'll be fine.

385
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,930
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>不
<13-1,AGENT WALKER>No.

386
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,480
<13-2,RYAN>你会死的
<13-2,RYAN>You'll be dead.

387
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,890
<13-3,SIOBHAN>瞧瞧你  终于说实话了
<13-3,SIOBHAN>Look at you, telling the truth.

388
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,490
<13-3,SIOBHAN>那条子说得对  我现在死定了
<13-3,SIOBHAN>The cop is right. I'm screwed six ways to sunday here.

389
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,040
<13-4,RYAN>鲍比·S把"圣经"放在哪
<13-4,RYAN>Where does Bobby S. keep the bible?

390
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,540
<13-5,AGENT WALKER>在他卧室的保险箱里
<13-5,AGENT WALKER>In his bedroom safe.

391
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,700
<13-6,RYAN>吉米原打算怎么拿到手
<13-6,RYAN>How was Jimmy gonna get it?

392
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,190
<13-7,AGENT WALKER>每周四  鲍比·S会找大伙去赌桌球
<13-7,AGENT WALKER>Every Thursday, Bobby S. has the guys over to bet on pool.

393
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,760
<13-7,AGENT WALKER>吉米本该在那时候下手
<13-7,AGENT WALKER>Jimmy was supposed to do it then.

394
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,190
<13-8,RYAN>密码是多少
<13-8,RYAN>What about the combination?

395
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,110
<13-9,SIOBHAN>鲍比每周五都会改密码
<13-9,SIOBHAN>Bobby changes it every Friday.

396
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,000
<13-9,SIOBHAN>但我知道他的规律
<13-9,SIOBHAN>But I know the system he uses.

397
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,940
<13-10,RYAN>吉米之所以能拿到圣经
<13-10,RYAN>And Jimmy could get the bible

398
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,260
<13-10,RYAN>是因为他是帮派成员
<13-10,RYAN>because he was one of the crew,

399
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,140
<13-10,RYAN>可以进入鲍比·S的房子
<13-10,RYAN>and he has access to Bobby S's house.

400
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,900
<13-11,AGENT WALKER>现在我们在内部没有人了
<13-11,AGENT WALKER>And now we got no one inside.

401
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,850
<13-12,RYAN>我去
<13-12,RYAN>I'll go in.

402
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,330
<13-12,RYAN>我去拿那本"圣经"
<13-12,RYAN>I'll get the bible.

403
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,520
<13-13,AGENT WALKER>真的吗
<13-13,AGENT WALKER>Really?

404
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,310
<13-13,AGENT WALKER>你  怎么做
<13-13,AGENT WALKER>You? How?

405
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,630
<13-14,RYAN>你知道我当年跟鲍比·S关系很铁
<13-14,RYAN>You know how close I was to Bobby S. Back then.

406
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,530
<13-14,RYAN>我作为费顿·奥康纳的身份并没有暴露
<13-14,RYAN>My Fenton O'connell cover is still good.

407
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,290
<13-15,AGENT WALKER>警探  那是七年前的事了
<13-15,AGENT WALKER>Detective, that was seven years ago.

408
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,180
<13-16,RYAN>帮派成员只知道
<13-16,RYAN>As far as the crew knows,

409
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,720
<13-16,RYAN>联调局找上门时我跑了
<13-16,RYAN>I bolted when the feds swooped in.

410
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,080
<13-16,RYAN>你们还起诉了费顿·奥唐纳  对吧
<13-16,RYAN>You guys even filed indictments against Fenton O'connell, right?

411
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,740
<13-17,AGENT WALKER>对
<13-17,AGENT WALKER>Yeah.

412
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,810
<13-18,RYAN>那本圣经我们找了多久了
<13-18,RYAN>How long has law enforcement been after that bible,

413
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,250
<13-18,RYAN>15年  20年
<13-18,RYAN>15, 20 years, huh?

414
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,160
<13-18,RYAN>这些家伙是毒瘤
<13-18,RYAN>These guys are drug-dealing parasites.

415
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,950
<13-18,RYAN>什么时候再有机会把他们一网打尽
<13-18,RYAN>When are you gonna get another shot to wipe 'em all out?

416
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,210
<13-18,RYAN>听着  你想要那本圣经
<13-18,RYAN>Look, you want the bible,

417
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,540
<13-18,RYAN>我们想缉拿凶手鲍比·S
<13-18,RYAN>we want Bobby S. for murder,

418
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,170
<13-18,RYAN>雪芳想继续活着
<13-18,RYAN>Siobhan wants to keep breathing.

419
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,700
<13-18,RYAN>人人获利
<13-18,RYAN>Everybody wins.

420
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,000
<13-18,RYAN>我可以做到
<13-18,RYAN>I can do this.

421
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,900
<13-19,AGENT WALKER>我去请示一下上级
<13-19,AGENT WALKER>Let me run this by my A.S.A.C.

422
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,820
<13-20,SIOBHAN>你干什么
<13-20,SIOBHAN>What are you doing?

423
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,250
<13-20,SIOBHAN>你疯了吗
<13-20,SIOBHAN>Are you out of your mind?

424
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,890
<13-21,RYAN>我当过费顿  我可以重扮一次
<13-21,RYAN>I was Fenton. I can be him again.

425
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,600
<13-22,SIOBHAN>别为了我丢了性命
<13-22,SIOBHAN>Don't get yourself killed on my account.

426
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,280
<13-23,RYAN>好吧  你恨我
<13-23,RYAN>Okay. Yeah, you hate me.

427
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
<13-23,RYAN>我知道  我活该
<13-23,RYAN>I get that, and I deserve it.

428
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,340
<13-23,RYAN>你想得到证人保护吗
<13-23,RYAN>But do you want to be put in witness relocation or not?

429
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,790
<13-23,RYAN>想不想
<13-23,RYAN>Yes or no?

430
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,230
<13-23,RYAN>警探
<13-23,RYAN>Detective...

431
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,680
<13-24,AGENT WALKER>你刚刚说的是认真的吗
<13-24,AGENT WALKER>Were you serious about that offer?

432
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,790
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>你已经很久没参与行动了  警探
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>You've been out of it a long time, detective.

433
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,520
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>组织发生了变化
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>There's a new hierarchy,

434
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,580
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>你必须尽快争取他们的信任
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>and you're going to have to win them over, fast.

435
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,200
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>你已经七年没扮费顿了
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>Seven years since you were Fenton--

436
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,720
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>太久了
<14-1,AGENT WALKTER>That's a lifetime.

437
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,980
<15-1,AGENT WALKER>光扮演还不够
<15-1,AGENT WALKER>It's not enough to act like him.

438
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,780
<15-1,AGENT WALKER>你必须成为这个人
<15-1,AGENT WALKER>You must become him.

439
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,150
<15-2,RYAN>我就是费顿·奥康纳
<15-2,RYAN>I am Fenton O'connell.

440
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,630
<15-2,RYAN>如果你说服不了他们
<15-2,RYAN>If you're not convincing,

<19-1,ESPOSITO>如果我戴这些  鲍比·S会发现的
<19-1,ESPOSITO>If I did, Bobby S. would find 'em.

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,370
<20-9,SIOBHAN>你到底去哪里了
<20-9,SIOBHAN>Where the hell have you been?

472
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
<20-10,RYAN>听着  你生气  我懂
<20-10,RYAN>Look, you're pissed. I get it.

473
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,630
<20-10,RYAN>可这事我们私下解决  好吗
<20-10,RYAN>But we'll work all this... out, maybe a little less publicly.

474
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,080
<20-10,RYAN>不过我得先找鲍比·S聊聊
<20-10,RYAN>But first I need to talk to Bobby S.

475
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,950
<20-11,SIOBHAN>原来你回来是找鲍比的
<20-11,SIOBHAN>Oh, that's why you came back, for Bobby?

476
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,070
<20-12,RYAN>让我谈好正事
<20-12,RYAN>Let me handle my business,

477
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,980
<20-12,RYAN>然后我把时间都给你
<20-12,RYAN>and then I'll have nothing but time for you.

478
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,010
<20-13,MAGGIE>你可真有魅力
<20-13,MAGGIE>Ah, you are such a charmer.

479
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,490
<20-13,MAGGIE>可如果你要找的是鲍比·S
<20-13,MAGGIE>But if it's Bobby S. you're after,

480
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,310
<20-13,MAGGIE>就得先和他的二把手谈
<20-13,MAGGIE>you're gonna have to go through his number two.

481
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,130
<20-14,RYAN>是吗  谁呢
<20-14,RYAN>Yeah? Who might that be?

482
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,590
<20-15,MAGGIE>我丈夫
<20-15,MAGGIE>My husband...

483
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,180
<20-15,MAGGIE>连姆
<20-15,MAGGIE>Liam.

484
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,470
<21-1,ESPOSITO>跟你说  他不是我认识的莱恩了
<21-1,ESPOSITO>I'm telling you, man. He's not the Ryan I know.

485
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,530
<21-1,ESPOSITO>我说的不仅是他的发型和着装
<21-1,ESPOSITO>And I'm not just talking about the haircut and the clothes.

486
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,350
<21-1,ESPOSITO>他像是变了个人
<21-1,ESPOSITO>It's like he's a different dude.

487
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,080
<21-2,CASTLE>他就该是那样子
<21-2,CASTLE>That's what he's supposed to be.

488
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,970
<21-2,CASTLE>他进入角色了  他是费顿  那很好
<21-2,CASTLE>He's in character. He's Fenton. That's good.

489
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,030
<21-3,ESPOSITO>如果他还不够好呢
<21-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but what if he's not good enough?

490
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,680
<21-3,ESPOSITO>时隔七年  难免有所生疏
<21-3,ESPOSITO>After seven years, he's gotta be rusty.

491
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,410
<21-3,ESPOSITO>这些斯坦顿岛的家伙可不是吃素的
<21-3,ESPOSITO>And these Staten Island boys are no joke.

492
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,150
<21-4,BECKETT>两位  帮莱恩最好的方式
<21-4,BECKETT>You guys, the best way to help Ryan

493
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,560
<21-4,BECKETT>是给鲍比·S定罪
<21-4,BECKETT>is by building a case against Bobby S.

494
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,520
<21-5,ESPOSITO>可能比我们设想的棘手
<21-5,ESPOSITO>That might be trickier than we thought.

495
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,540
<21-5,ESPOSITO>鲍比·S的68款突击者有张电子付费通行卡
<21-5,ESPOSITO>Bobby S's '68 Charger has an electronic E-Z Pass,

496
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,430
<21-5,ESPOSITO>而且记录显示
<21-5,ESPOSITO>and records show

497
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,130
<21-5,ESPOSITO>突击者开车去扬克斯
<21-5,ESPOSITO>the Charger drove to Yonkers

498
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,660
<21-5,ESPOSITO>在上午十点通过乔治·华盛顿桥
<21-5,ESPOSITO>via the George Washington Bridge around 10:00 A.M.

499
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,300
<21-5,ESPOSITO>下午两点后才回程
<21-5,ESPOSITO>It didn't make the return trip till after 2:00 P.M.

500
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,110
<21-6,CASTLE>吉米在11点半到12点间遇害
<21-6,CASTLE>Jimmy was killed between 11:30 and 12:00.

501
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,350
<21-6,CASTLE>这帮鲍比洗清了嫌疑
<21-6,CASTLE>That puts Bobby in the clear.

502
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,390
<21-7,BECKETT>怎么可能
<21-7,BECKETT>How is that possible?

503
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,540
<21-7,BECKETT>托德在面包店门口看到的那辆车
<21-7,BECKETT>The car that Todd saw outside of the bakery

504
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,930
<21-7,BECKETT>一定是鲍比·S的
<21-7,BECKETT>had to have been Bobby S's.

505
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,290
<21-8,CASTLE>或许他想办法让电子付费通行卡失效了
<21-8,CASTLE>Maybe he somehow disabled his E-Z Pass,

506
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,130
<21-8,CASTLE>制造出他往返扬克斯的假象
<21-8,CASTLE>making it appear as though all he did was go to and from Yonkers.

507
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,270
<21-9,ESPOSITO>即便是这样  我们怎么证明呢
<21-9,ESPOSITO>Okay, yeah, but how do we prove that?

508
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,170
<21-10,BECKETT>我们查清他在扬克斯期间的去处
<21-10,BECKETT>We figure out where he went when he was in Yonkers.

509
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,230
<21-10,BECKETT>然后找证据
<21-10,BECKETT>And then we find evidence

510
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,250
<21-10,BECKETT>证明他在死亡时间区离开过那里
<21-10,BECKETT>that he left during our time-of-death window.

511
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,770
<21-10,BECKETT>他想制造不在场证明  我们就拆穿他
<21-10,BECKETT>He's trying to build an alibi, and we're gonna tear it down.

512
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
<22-1,LIAM>把你手机给我
<22-1,LIAM>Give me your phone.

513
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,710
<22-2,RYAN>为什么
<22-2,RYAN>Why?

514
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,190
<22-3,LIAM>鲍比·S向来信不过电子设备
<22-3,LIAM>Bobby S. has an abiding distrust of electronic devices.

515
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,380
<22-1,LIAM>把你手机给我
<22-1,LIAM>Give me your phone.

516
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,160
<22-4,RYAN>这不是让人家生误会吗
<22-4,RYAN>Whoa. Whoa. What'll the missus think, huh?

517
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,000
<23-1,RYAN>鲍比
<23-1,RYAN>Hey, Bobby.

518
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,240
<23-2,BOBBY S>我认识你吗
<23-2,BOBBY S>Do I know you?

519
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,250
<23-3,RYAN>搞什么  是我  费顿
<23-3,RYAN>What the hell? It's me Fenton.

520
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,080
<23-4,BOBBY>我记得多年前认识个费顿·奥唐纳
<23-4,BOBBY>I recall knowing a Fenton O'connell years ago.

521
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,490
<23-4,BOBBY>他待我情同手足
<23-4,BOBBY>He was like a brother to me.

522
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,050
<23-4,BOBBY>非常仗义的家伙
<23-4,BOBBY>Real stand-up guy...

523
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,000
<23-4,BOBBY>直到他跑路了
<23-4,BOBBY>Till he cut and ran.

524
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,600
<23-4,BOBBY>别这样  鲍比
<23-4,BOBBY>Come on, Bobby.

525
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,570
<23-5,RYAN>我被出卖了  你知道的
<23-5,RYAN>I got ratted out. You know that.

526
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,650
<23-5,RYAN>我要留下来
<23-5,RYAN>Me hanging around

527
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,530
<23-5,RYAN>只会给大家都惹麻烦
<23-5,RYAN>woulda just brought more heat down on everyone.

528
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,060
<23-6,BOBBY>所以你就人间蒸发了
<23-6,BOBBY>So you made yourself scarce.

529
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,540
<23-6,BOBBY>实际上  这七年里没人有你的音讯
<23-6,BOBBY>In fact, no one's heard from you in... seven years.

530
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,010
<23-6,BOBBY>你去哪里了
<23-6,BOBBY>Where you been?

531

<23-7,RYAN>西部
<23-7,RYAN>Out west.

532
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,040
<23-7,RYAN>四处干了点小打小闹
<23-7,RYAN>Been making some moves here and there

533
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,200
<23-7,RYAN>直到过了诉讼时效
<23-7,RYAN>until the statute of limitations ran out.

534
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,550
<23-7,RYAN>老实说  鲍比
<23-7,RYAN>Tell you the truth, Bobby,

535
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,350
<23-7,RYAN>我要是手里没有好货
<23-7,RYAN>I didn't want to come home till I had something

536
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,550
<23-7,RYAN>都不好意思回来
<23-7,RYAN>to bring to the table.

537
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,630
<23-8,BOBBY>朋友
<23-8,BOBBY>Well, friend...

<23-9,RYAN>我听说联调局抓走了本·吉迪恩
<23-9,RYAN>I heard the feds took down Ben Gideon,

540
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,830
<23-9,RYAN>你可能需要一些货源
<23-9,RYAN>so you might be in need of some product.

541
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,370
<23-9,RYAN>我一直和梅森兄弟在芝加哥外奔波
<23-9,RYAN>I been working with the Mason brothers out of Chicago.

542
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,440
<23-10,LIAM>我听说过他们
<23-10,LIAM>I've heard of 'em.

543
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,080
<23-11,RYAN>这是稳定的货源  质量也不错
<23-11,RYAN>It's a stable source, quality stuff.

544
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,930
<23-11,RYAN>我可以帮你弄到一切你想要的
<23-11,RYAN>I can get you whatever you need.

545
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,090
<23-11,RYAN>我在扩展销路  鲍比
<23-11,RYAN>This is me stepping up, Bobby.

546
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,810
<23-11,RYAN>那又怎样
<23-11,RYAN>So what...

547
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,000
<23-12,BOBBY>你就是歌里唱到的漂泊者
<23-12,BOBBY>You're the wild rover from the song?

<23-12,BOBBY>"满载着黄金而归"  是这个吧
<23-12,BOBBY>"Returning with gold in great store," is that it?

549
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,040
<23-12,BOBBY>要么你就是奸细
<23-12,BOBBY>Or are you a rat?

550
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,510
<23-13,RYAN>你知道我不是这种人
<23-13,RYAN>You know me better than that.

<23-13,RYAN>该说的我都说了  我不会求你的  鲍比
<23-13,RYAN>I said my piece, but I'm not gonna beg, Bobby.

553
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,400
<23-13,RYAN>看你的了  好吗
<23-13,RYAN>It's up to you, okay?

557
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,450

<23-14,BOBBY>or should I have Liam put a bullet

558
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,940
<23-14,BOBBY>射进你的后脑
<23-14,BOBBY>in the back of your head?

<23-15,LIAM>Oh, just say the word, Bobby.

560
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,240
<23-16,RYAN>你要是觉得我是奸细
<23-16,RYAN>You think I'm some kind of rat,

561
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,550
<23-16,RYAN>一个不正直的人
<23-16,RYAN>that I'm a man without honor?

562
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,890
<23-16,RYAN>那就动手吧
<23-16,RYAN>Then you pull the trigger.

563
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,660
<23-16,RYAN>要是你怀疑我  鲍比
<23-16,RYAN>You doubt me, Bobby,

<24-7,MAGGIE>What do you think of him?

583
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,050
<24-8,LIAM>我怎么看无所谓  要看鲍比·S
<24-8,LIAM>Doesn't matter what I think. It's up to Bobby S.

584
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,170
<24-9,MAGGIE>是啊  可你相信他说的
<24-9,MAGGIE>Yeah, but do you buy his story

585
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,080
<24-9,MAGGIE>这七年他都在哪的故事吗
<24-9,MAGGIE>about where he's been for the last seven years?

586
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,630
<24-10,LIAM>我不知道  但我会去调查的
<24-10,LIAM>I don't know, but I'm gonna check it out.

587
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,080
<24-11,MAGGIE>要是他说谎了呢
<24-11,MAGGIE>And if he's lying about somethin'?

588
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,770
<24-12,LIAM>那我就杀了这个混蛋
<24-12,LIAM>Then I'll kill the bastard.

589
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,460
<25-1,BECKETT>我想我知道鲍比·S去了扬克斯什么地方
<25-1,BECKETT>So I think I figured out where Bobby S went in Yonkers.

590
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,440
<25-1,BECKETT>去了跑马场
<25-1,BECKETT>The Raceway.

591
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,410
<25-1,BECKETT>他在那里的取款机取了500美元
<25-1,BECKETT>He pulled out $500 in cash from the A.T.M. there.

592
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
<25-2,CASTLE>去赌马了
<25-2,CASTLE>Betting on the ponies.

593
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,070
<25-2,CASTLE>停车场里有监控吗
<25-2,CASTLE>Any security cameras in the parking lot?

594
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,600
<25-3,BECKETT>埃斯波正在查  要是我们能证明
<25-3,BECKETT>Espo's checking right now, but if we can prove

595
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,840
<25-3,BECKETT>他恰好在案发时间离开
<25-3,BECKETT>that he left just before our time-of-death window,

596
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,620
<25-3,BECKETT>那就帮我们给他定罪了
<25-3,BECKETT>then that should help us nail him for the murder.

597
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,090
<25-4,BECKETT>不用了  谢谢  我很好
<25-4,BECKETT>Oh, no. Thank you. I'm fine.

598
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,100
<25-5,CASTLE>我们有莱恩的消息吗
<25-5,CASTLE>So do we know how Ryan's doing?

599
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,280
<25-6,BECKETT>没有  我讨厌有事情发生我却不知道
<25-6,BECKETT>I don't know, and I hate not knowing things.

600
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,760
<25-7,CASTLE>好吧  听着
<25-7,CASTLE>Okay, look. Uh...

601
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,010
<25-7,CASTLE>乔丹不是女的  行了吗
<25-7,CASTLE>Jordan is not a woman, all right?

602
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,170
<25-8,BECKETT>那他是谁啊  或者是什么啊
<25-8,BECKETT>Then who is it? Or rather, what is it?

603
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,260
<25-9,CASTLE>这重要吗
<25-9,CASTLE>Why does it matter?

604
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,080
<25-10,BECKETT>因为  卡塞尔  对你很重要
<25-10,BECKETT>Because, Castle, it matters to you.

605
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,900
<25-10,BECKETT>你就不能告诉我吗
<25-10,BECKETT>Why won't you tell me?

606
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,940
<25-11,BECKETT>蕾妮确定吉米·韦兰身上纤维的来源了
<25-11,BECKETT>Lanie's identified the fibers on Jimmy Whelan.

607
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,970
<25-11,BECKETT>是澳大利亚的羊毛制品
<25-11,BECKETT>They are... wool from an Australian sheep.

608
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,400
<25-12,CASTLE>也许鲍比有帮手
<25-12,CASTLE>Ah, perhaps Bobby's had an accomplice--

609
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,280
<25-12,CASTLE>一只冷血凶恶的绵羊
<25-12,CASTLE>a cold-blooded, murderous sheep.

610
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,990
<25-14,CASTLE>-就是这个  -真的假的
<25-14,CASTLE>- That's it. - Seriously?

611
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,380
<25-15,BECKETT>不是那个  看这个
<25-15,BECKETT>No, not that. This. Look.

612
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,030
<25-15,BECKETT>看他穿的外套
<25-15,BECKETT>Look at the jacket he's wearing.

613
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,580
<25-15,BECKETT>是皮革的
<25-15,BECKETT>It's leather shearling...

614
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,430
<25-15,BECKETT>上面有羊毛
<25-15,BECKETT>with wool.

615
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,780
<25-16,CASTLE>-这就和谋杀案联系起来了  -别急
<25-16,CASTLE>- That ties him to the murder. - Not so fast.

616
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,590
<25-17,ESPOSITO>跑道的贵宾停车区区
<25-17,ESPOSITO>There were no cameras in the V.I.P. parking area

617
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,630
<25-17,ESPOSITO>没有监控
<25-17,ESPOSITO>of the racetrack.

618
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,760
<25-17,ESPOSITO>但那天是鲍比·S的幸运日
<25-17,ESPOSITO>But it turns out Bobby S had a lucky day.

619
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,870
<25-17,ESPOSITO>40比1的概率他都赢了  赚了一万四
<25-17,ESPOSITO>His 40-to-1 long shot won. Netted him 14 grand.

620
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,760
<25-18,CASTLE>他穿着同一件外套
<25-18,CASTLE>And wearing the same coat.

621
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,400
<25-19,ESPOSITO>问题是
<25-19,ESPOSITO>The problem is,

622
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,350
<25-19,ESPOSITO>他填交税表格的时间
<25-19,ESPOSITO>he's filling out his w-2g tax forms

623
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,720
<25-19,ESPOSITO>与吉米被杀的时间一致
<25-19,ESPOSITO>at the exact same time that Jimmy got whacked.

624
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,030
<25-20,CASTLE>那鲍比就不可能是凶手了
<25-20,CASTLE>Then Bobby can't be our killer.

625
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,010
<25-21,BECKETT>他是被陷害的
<25-21,BECKETT>So he was being set up.

626
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,900
<25-21,BECKETT>有人借了鲍比·S的车  留下那些纤维
<25-21,BECKETT>Someone borrowed Bobby S's car, planed those fibers,

627
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,910
<25-21,BECKETT>这就是为了让他当替罪羊
<25-21,BECKETT>All in an effort to make him look like the killer.

628
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,360
<25-22,ESPOSITO>要是有人陷害鲍比
<25-22,ESPOSITO>If someone's trying to set Bobby up,

629
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,580
<25-22,ESPOSITO>莱恩就必须知道这一点
<25-22,ESPOSITO>Ryan needs to know.

630
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,180
<26-1,RYAN>你知道这么见面很危险
<26-1,RYAN>You know... it's risky meeting like this.

631
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,700
<26-1,RYAN>最好是有重要的事
<26-1,RYAN>It better be important.

632
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,580
<26-2,ESPOSITO>吉米不是鲍比杀的
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Bobby didn't kill Jimmy.

633
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,580
<26-2,ESPOSITO>真正的凶手偷了他的车然后陷害他
<26-2,ESPOSITO>The real killer stole his car and set him up.

634
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,750
<26-3,RYAN>或者是鲍比命令别人做的
<26-3,RYAN>Or Bobby ordered the hit

635
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,220
<26-3,RYAN>把车借给了凶手
<26-3,RYAN>And loaned his car to the killer.

636
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:02,900
<26-4,ESPOSITO>不是的  老兄
<26-4,ESPOSITO>No, bro.

637
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,300
<26-4,ESPOSITO>现场的证据是特意留下的
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Forensic evidence was purposefully left behind.

638
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,630
<26-4,ESPOSITO>这是陷害
<26-4,ESPOSITO>It's a frame.

639
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,080
<26-4,ESPOSITO>很可能就是他帮派里的人
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Probably someone in his own crew.

640
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,770
<26-5,RYAN>好的  我会留心的
<26-5,RYAN>Okay. I'll keep my eyes open.

641
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,610
<26-6,ESPOSITO>这对你有什么好处啊
<26-6,ESPOSITO>What good is that gonna do you, hmm?

642
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,230
<26-6,ESPOSITO>一旦那边发生了什么事  我不在你身边
<26-6,ESPOSITO>What good is that gonna do you when something goes down,

643
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,370
<26-6,ESPOSITO>这对你有什么好处啊
<26-6,ESPOSITO>I'm not there to back you up?

644
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,040
<26-6,ESPOSITO>你要做的就是放任不管
<26-6,ESPOSITO>What you need to do is walk away.

645
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,440
<26-7,RYAN>等完事了我再离开
<26-7,RYAN>I'll walk away when I'm done.

646
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,300
<26-8,ESPOSITO>你想什么呢
<26-8,ESPOSITO>What's wrong with you?

647
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,090
<26-8,ESPOSITO>你根本输不起 哥们  你有珍妮
<26-8,ESPOSITO>You got a lot to lose, man. You got Jenny.

648
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,870
<26-8,ESPOSITO>你还准备要个孩子
<26-8,ESPOSITO>You're trying to start a family.

649
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,990
<26-9,RYAN>用不着你告诉我这有多危险
<26-9,RYAN>I don't need you to tell me what's at stake here.

650
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,120
<26-9,RYAN>听着
<26-9,RYAN>Look, man...

651
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,490
<26-9,RYAN>鲍比邀请我今晚和他去打台球
<26-9,RYAN>I got invite to Bobby's pool game tonight.

652
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,570
<26-9,RYAN>就等这个呢
<26-9,RYAN>This is it.

653
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,510
<26-9,RYAN>这是我拿到圣经的机会
<26-9,RYAN>This is my shot at getting that bible.

654
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,590
<26-10,ESPOSITO>这不值得啊  伙计
<26-10,ESPOSITO>It's not worth it, man.

655
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,670
<26-11,RYAN>到手了我就给你打电话
<26-11,RYAN>I'll call you when I get it.

656
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,930
<27-1,SIOBHAN>鲍比怎么可能不是凶手
<27-1,SIOBHAN>How could bobby is not be the killer?

657
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,600
<27-1,SIOBHAN>我听他亲口说觉得吉米是奸细
<27-1,SIOBHAN>I heard him say he thought jimmy was a rat.

658
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,950
<27-2,RYAN>肯定别人也听到了
<27-2,RYAN>Someone else must've heard that, too.

659
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,860
<27-3,SIOBHAN>帮派里的人吗
<27-3,SIOBHAN>Someone in the crew?

660
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,980
<27-4,RYAN>肯定是这样  对吧
<27-4,RYAN>It has to be, right?

661
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,900
<27-5,SIOBHAN>这太糟了  你今晚不能去打台球了
<27-5,SIOBHAN>This is bad. You can't go to the pool game tonight.

662
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,850
<27-6,RYAN>我必须去
<27-6,RYAN>I have to go.

663
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,470
<27-6,RYAN>我不会再有别的机会了
<27-6,RYAN>I won't get another chance.

664
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,240
<27-6,RYAN>这也是你唯一的机会
<27-6,RYAN>You won't get another chance.

665
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,060
<27-6,RYAN>鲍比保险箱的密码是多少
<27-6,RYAN>What's the combination to Bobby's safe?

666
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,400
<27-7,SIOBHAN>304217
<27-7,SIOBHAN>3-0-4-2-1-7.

667
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,930
<27-7,SIOBHAN>304217  你怎么知道的
<27-7,SIOBHAN>3-0-4-2-1-7. How do you know that?

668
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,940
<27-9,SIOBHAN>周五晚上鲍比会叫我打电话给他
<27-9,SIOBHAN>Bobby has me ring up a total on the cash register

669
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,690
<27-9,SIOBHAN>告诉他收银机里钱的总数
<27-9,SIOBHAN>on friday nights.

670
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,660
<27-9,SIOBHAN>他用总款数当做密码
<27-9,SIOBHAN>He bases the combination on that total.

671
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,780
<27-10,RYAN>我们会顺利度过这一关的
<27-10,RYAN>We're gonna get through this.

672
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,510
<27-11,RYAN>不是吧  你还留着这个小家伙
<27-11,RYAN>Oh, come on. You still have this little guy?

673
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,760
<27-11,RYAN>等等  它叫什么名字来着
<27-11,RYAN>Wait. Um, what his name again?

674
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,880
<27-12,SIOBHAN>你怎么能忘了胡子先生呢
<27-12,SIOBHAN>How could you forget Mr. Whiskers?

675
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,180
<27-12,SIOBHAN>你花了50刀才帮我赢回了他
<27-12,SIOBHAN>You spent over 50 bucks trying to win him for me.

676
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
<27-13,RYAN>那个套圈游戏太坑爹了
<27-13,RYAN>That ring toss was a bitch.

677
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,850
<27-14,SIOBHAN>但他物有所值
<27-14,SIOBHAN>Well, it was worth every penny.

678
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,800
<27-14,SIOBHAN>他陪伴我度过了不少难关
<27-14,SIOBHAN>He's seen me through some pretty rough times.

679
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:42,890
<27-14,SIOBHAN>我们的过去没有一点是真的吗
<27-14,SIOBHAN>Was any of it real?

680
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,140
<27-15,RYAN>我对你的感情是真的
<27-15,RYAN>What I felt was.

681
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,550
<27-15,RYAN>我得走了
<27-15,RYAN>I gotta go.

682
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:00,830
<27-15,RYAN>今晚至关重要
<27-15,RYAN>Big night tonight.

683
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,010
<28-1,ESPOSITO>在扬克斯跑马场的调查
<28-1,ESPOSITO>So the canvass at Yonkers raceway

684
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,180
<28-1,ESPOSITO>有了新发现
<28-1,ESPOSITO>came up with something.

685
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,450
<28-1,ESPOSITO>泊车员见过鲍比·S的黑色道奇车
<28-1,ESPOSITO>A parking attendant saw Bobby S's black charger.

686
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,840
<28-1,ESPOSITO>车子在案发半小时后返回
<28-1,ESPOSITO>Now it returned 30 minutes after the murder.

687
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,430
<28-1,ESPOSITO>他只是远远地看到了  但他说
<28-1,ESPOSITO>He only saw it from a distance, but he says the driver

688
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,550
<28-1,ESPOSITO>司机带着一顶棒球帽
<28-1,ESPOSITO>Was wearing a baseball cap,

689
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,940
<28-1,ESPOSITO>随后他步行去了地铁站
<28-1,ESPOSITO>and he walked to the subway stop.

690
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,510
<28-2,BECKETT>联系一下纽约交管局
<28-2,BECKETT>Okay, let's touch base with the M.T.A.

691
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,080
<28-3,ESPOSITO>联系过了
<28-3,ESPOSITO>Already did.

692
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,800
<28-3,ESPOSITO>我参照了那段时间里所有消费过的地铁卡
<28-3,ESPOSITO>I cross-referenced all metrocards swiped at that time.

693
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,860
<28-3,ESPOSITO>有一张是用信用卡购买的
<28-3,ESPOSITO>One of them was bought with a credit card,

694
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,870
<28-3,ESPOSITO>信用卡的主人是连姆·芬奇
<28-3,ESPOSITO>and that credit card belonged to Liam Finch.

695
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
<28-3,ESPOSITO>他是鲍比·S的二把手
<28-3,ESPOSITO>That's Bobby S's number two.

696
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,310
<28-4,CASTLE>这是一场阴谋
<28-4,CASTLE>It's a coup.

697
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,330
<28-4,CASTLE>连姆设计陷害鲍比来上位
<28-4,CASTLE>Liam is framing Bobby to get him out of the way.

698
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,350
<28-4,CASTLE>他想要掌权
<28-4,CASTLE>He wants to take over.

699
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,120
<28-5,BECKETT>而莱恩正好插手了这件事
<28-5,BECKETT>And Ryan walked right in the middle of it.

700
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,320
<28-6,ESPOSITO>不止如此  他不仅插手了
<28-6,ESPOSITO>Worse. He didn't walk in the middle.

701
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,980
<28-6,ESPOSITO>而且以鲍比·S朋友的身份搅局
<28-6,ESPOSITO>He walked in as Bobby S's friend.

702
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,360
<28-6,ESPOSITO>他自然成为了连姆的敌人
<28-6,ESPOSITO>That makes him Liam's enemy.

703
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,610
<28-7,BECKETT>我们得提醒他
<28-7,BECKETT>Okay, we have to warn him.

704
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,570
<28-8,CASTLE>如果我们打给他  他的身份就暴露了
<28-8,CASTLE>If we call him, we could blow his cover.

705
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,030
<28-9,ESPOSITO>如果不打电话  他会被杀的
<28-9,ESPOSITO>If we don't, he could end up dead.

706
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,090
<29-1,BOBBY>不是吧你
<29-1,BOBBY>Get the hell outta here.

707
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,240
<29-1,BOBBY>你的台球什么时候打得这么好了
<29-1,BOBBY>Since when'd you become such a pool hustler?

708
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,700
<29-2,RYAN>请叫我"快杆艾迪"
<29-2,RYAN>Just call me Fast Eddie.

<29-3,BOBBY>I went over your numbers. I can live with 'em.

711
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,750
<29-3,BOBBY>你多久能把货从芝加哥运过来
<29-3,BOBBY>So how soon can you get some of that Chicago crank up here?

712

<29-4,RYAN>到这周末  我能弄到五磅
<29-4,RYAN>I can get you 5 pounds by this weekend.

713
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,820

<29-4,RYAN>你想要多少  我就有多少
<29-4,RYAN>I can get you however much you want.

715
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,150
<29-5,BOBBY>棒极了
<29-5,BOBBY>Love it.

716
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,860
<29-5,BOBBY>到你了  走狗屎运的混蛋
<29-5,BOBBY>Take your shot, you lucky bastard.

717
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,520
<29-6,MAN>基恩的电话  说有急事
<29-6,MAN>It's Keane. Says it's urgent.

718
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,000
<29-7,LIAM>基恩  怎么了
<29-7,LIAM>Yeah, Keane.

719
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,250
<29-8,KEANE>连姆  你说得对
<29-8,KEANE>Liam, you were right.

720
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,410
<29-8,KEANE>有奸细
<29-8,KEANE>We got a rat in the house.

721
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,170
<29-9,LIAM>待会儿打给你
<29-9,LIAM>I'll call you back.

722
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,140
<29-8,KEANE>他说我们之中有奸细
<29-8,KEANE>He said we got a rat in the house.

723
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,280
<29-10,RYAN>好啦  我要去上厕所
<29-10,RYAN>All right, I gotta hit the head.

724
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,730
<29-11,BOBBY>叫史迪威把车开到前门
<29-11,BOBBY>Tell Stevie to bring my car around front.

725
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,840
<30-1,LIAM>体育干将  我正找你呢
<30-1,LIAM>Hey,sport. Been looking for you.

726
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,640
<30-1,LIAM>鲍比·S叫我们开车兜兜风
<30-1,LIAM>Bobby S needs us to take a ride.

727
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,080
<30-2,RYAN>好的  我去拿下手机
<30-2,RYAN>Okay. Let me get my phone.

728
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,000
<30-3,LIAM>你用不上手机
<30-3,LIAM>You're not gonna be needing it.

729
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,100
<30-3,LIAM>车子就在外面  你负责开车
<30-3,LIAM>Car's out back. You're driving.

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,790
<30-5,LIAM>该走了  费顿

732
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,310
<31-1,ESPOSITO>莱恩还是不接电话
<31-1,ESPOSITO>Ryan's still not answering.

733
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,370
<31-2,CASTLE>如果鲍比·S不让人用手机
<31-2,CASTLE>Well,if Bobby S doesn't allow cell phones in his presence,

734
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,860
<31-2,CASTLE>那他可能还在和莱恩打台球
<31-2,CASTLE>maybe he and Ryan are still just playing pool.

735
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
<31-3,ESPOSITO>沃克特工说了什么
<31-3,ESPOSITO>What did Agent Walker say?

736
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,300
<31-4,BECKETT>联邦政府也不清楚莱恩在哪儿
<31-4,BECKETT>The Feds don't know any more than we do about where Ryan is.

737
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,760
<31-4,BECKETT>事情不太对劲
<31-4,BECKETT>Something's not right.

738
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,770
<31-5,JENNY>凯文遇到危险了吗
<31-5,JENNY>Guys... Is Kevin in trouble?

739
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,800
<31-5,JENNY>没有
<31-5,JENNY>Uh, no.

740
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,700
<31-6,ESPOSITO>我们只是在讨论些办案程序上的事
<31-6,ESPOSITO>We're just talking some procedural stuff.

741
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,260
<31-7,JENNY>别骗我了  哈维  到底怎么了
<31-7,JENNY>Don't lie to me, Javi. What's going on?

742
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,480
<31-7,JENNY>我丈夫呢
<31-7,JENNY>Where's my husband?

743
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,440
<31-8,BECKETT>珍妮  我们边喝咖啡边聊吧
<31-8,BECKETT>Jenny, maybe we should go get a coffee.

744
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,210
<32-1,JENNY>那么你们不知道他在哪儿
<32-1,JENNY>So you don't know where he is?

745
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,680
<32-2,BECKETT>是的  但是我们会找到他的
<32-2,BECKETT>No. But we are going to find him.

746
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,560
<32-2,BECKETT>我们认为他并没有遇到什么大危险
<32-2,BECKETT>And,um,we don't believe that he's in any immediate danger.

747
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,740
<32-3,JENNY>他为什么要这样做
<32-3,JENNY>Why would he do a thing like this?

748
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,030
<32-3,JENNY>他可能是想证明些什么
<32-3,JENNY>Maybe he thinks he has something to prove

749
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,980
<32-3,JENNY>因为我的...怀孕问题
<32-3,JENNY>'Cause of all of our... pregnancy stuff.

750
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,780
<32-4,BECKETT>我觉得其中有很多原因
<32-4,BECKETT>You know,I think that there are probably a number of reasons,

751
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,100
<32-4,BECKETT>但主要原因是  他想做对的事
<32-4,BECKETT>But the main one is that he just wants to do the right thing.

752
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,340
<32-4,BECKETT>那才是他  那是他当警察的原因
<32-4,BECKETT>I mean,that's who he is, that's why he became a cop,

753
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,730
<32-4,BECKETT>那正是你爱上他的原因
<32-4,BECKETT>That's why you fell in love with him.

754
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,180
<32-5,JENNY>我只想他平安回来
<32-5,JENNY>I just want him to come home.

755
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,150
<32-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特  我有话跟你说
<32-6,ESPOSITO>Hey,Beckett. I need to talk to you.

756
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,040
<33-1,RYAN>我们要去码头吗
<33-1,RYAN>We going to the docks?

757
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,650
<33-3,RYAN>在码头只有两件事可做
<33-3,RYAN>Only two things to do at the docks--

758
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,540
<33-3,RYAN>杀人或是钓鱼
<33-3,RYAN>Kill someone or go fishing.

759
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,780
<33-3,RYAN>现在钓鱼有点晚了  不是吗
<33-3,RYAN>Kinda late to be fishing,ain't it?

760
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,110
<33-4,LIAM>是的  鱼儿都睡着了
<33-4,LIAM>Yep. All the fishies are asleep.

761
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,100
<34-1,RYAN>什么情况
<34-1,RYAN>What now,huh?

762
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,680
<34-2,LIAM>我一直对你有所怀疑
<34-2,LIAM>You know,I had my suspicions about you

763
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,540
<34-2,LIAM>自你踏进雪芳的酒吧的那刻起
<34-2,LIAM>from the moment you walked into Siobhan's bar.

764
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,340
<34-2,LIAM>可每个人都说费顿是纯爷们
<34-2,LIAM>But,no. Everybody said,"Fenton is stand-up. "

765
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,240
<34-2,LIAM>大家都相信你  包括鲍比·S
<34-2,LIAM>Everybody vouched for you,even Bobby S.

766
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,500
<34-3,RYAN>但你仍然怀疑我  是吧
<34-3,RYAN>But you still had your doubts,huh?

767
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,690
<34-3,RYAN>是的
<34-3,RYAN>That's right.

768
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,170
<34-4,LIAM>所以今天我让基恩跟踪你
<34-4,LIAM>So I had Keane follow you around today.

769
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,970
<34-4,LIAM>我知道我们之中有个奸细
<34-4,LIAM>You know,I knew that we had a rat amongst us.

770
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,380
<34-4,LIAM>但是我不明白的是
<34-4,LIAM>But what I didn't figure

771
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:07,950
<34-4,LIAM>他是怎么在我们眼皮子底下伪装的
<34-4,LIAM>was how that rat could hide in plain sight.

772
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,670
<34-6,SIOBHAN>-雪芳  -对不起
<34-6,SIOBHAN>- Siobhan? - I'm sorry.

773
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,400
<34-7,BOBBY>我也是  兄弟
<34-7,BOBBY>So am I,brother.

774
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,090
<34-8,LIAM>基恩跟着你去了雪芳的家
<34-8,LIAM>Keane followed you over to Siobhan's place.

775
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,810
<34-9,KEANE>是的  我和她的邻居聊天
<34-9,KEANE>Yeah,I spoke with one of her neighbors.

776
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,290
<34-9,KEANE>发现她两天前被警察抓住了
<34-9,KEANE>Turns out she was picked up by the cops two days ago.

777
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,200
<34-10,LIAM>基恩很好奇  所以闯进了她家
<34-10,LIAM>Being an inquisitive lad,Keane broke in to her place.

778
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,800
<34-10,LIAM>告诉他你的发现吧  基恩
<34-10,LIAM>Tell him what you found,Keane.

779
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,810
<34-11,KEANE>我翻了她的手机记录  费顿
<34-11,KEANE>I went through her cell phone,Fenton.

780
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,820
<34-11,KEANE>伙计  她曾和联邦调查局通过话
<34-11,KEANE>Man,she's been talking to the FBI.

781
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,450
<34-12,BOBBY>这一切无疑是她捣的鬼
<34-12,BOBBY>After all this time, nothing but a snitch.

782
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,410
<34-12,BOBBY>犹大的内心
<34-12,BOBBY>A judas...

783
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,490
<34-12,BOBBY>天使的脸庞
<34-12,BOBBY>With an angel's face.

784
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,550
<34-12,BOBBY>费顿  你知道的  我很讲求公平
<34-12,BOBBY>Now,Fenton,you know me. I'm nothing if not fair.

785
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,570
<34-12,BOBBY>因此我给你一个公平的机会
<34-12,BOBBY>So I'm gonna give you a fair chance

786
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,070
<34-12,BOBBY>来证明你与此事无关
<34-12,BOBBY>to prove you knew nothing about this.

787
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,000
<34-13,BOBBY>打得她脑袋开花
<34-13,BOBBY>Blow her brains out.

788
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,050
<35-1,BOBBY>费顿  今晚不是她死
<35-1,BOBBY>Fenton,we're leaving with one

789
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,480
<35-1,BOBBY>就是你们一起死
<35-1,BOBBY>or two bodies tonight.

790
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,820
<35-1,BOBBY>全看你的说
<35-1,BOBBY>It's up to you.

791
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:48,210
<35-2,SIOBHAN>没关系的  我不怪你
<35-2,SIOBHAN>It's okay. It's not your fault.

792
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,270
<35-2,SIOBHAN>开枪吧
<35-2,SIOBHAN>Just do it.

793
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,620
<35-3,RYAN>我做不到  鲍比
<35-3,RYAN>I just can't do it, Bobby.

794
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,080
<35-3,RYAN>我不能打死她
<35-3,RYAN>I can't shoot her.

795
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,050
<35-3,RYAN>但是我能够打死你
<35-3,RYAN>However I have no problem shooting you.

796
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,760
<35-4,RYAN>空弹匣  贱人
<35-4,RYAN>Empty. You son of a bitch.

797
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,790
<35-5,BOBBY>以防万一  兄弟
<35-5,BOBBY>Had to be sure, friend.

798
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,210
<35-5,BOBBY>该死的  我对你太失望了  费顿
<35-5,BOBBY>And damn. I'm so disappointed in you, Fenton.

799
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,530
<35-6,RYAN>你还会更失望的
<35-6,RYAN>Not as disappointed as you're about to be.

800
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,690
<35-6,RYAN>我的真名不是费顿
<35-6,RYAN>My name's not Fenton.

801
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,240
<35-7,BOBBY>而是凯文·莱恩
<35-7,BOBBY>It's Kevin Ryan,

802
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,840
<35-7,BOBBY>我是警察
<35-7,BOBBY>And I'm a cop.

803
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,040
<35-8,RYAN>什么  你是警察
<35-8,RYAN>What? A cop?

804
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,790
<35-8,RYAN>没错  而且我要逮捕你们三个
<35-8,RYAN>Yeah, and I'm placing the three of you under arrest.

805
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,390
<35-9,BOBBY>想得美
<35-9,BOBBY>Well, that'll be a hell of a trick,

806
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,980
<35-9,BOBBY>考虑到连姆马上就要崩了你和你的女友
<35-9,BOBBY>considering Liam's about to shoot you... and your girlfriend.

807
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,770
<35-10,RYAN>等等  连姆  先别动手
<35-10,RYAN>Wait a second. Liam, before you do that,

808
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,030
<35-10,RYAN>我先问你个问题  你的手机在哪儿
<35-10,RYAN>let me ask you a question. Where's your cell phone, huh?

809
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:53,920
<35-11,LIAM>什么
<35-11,LIAM>What?

810
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,520
<35-12,RYAN>还记得我们在大厅扭打的时候吗
<35-12,RYAN>Remember when we tussled back in the hall?

811
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,040
<35-12,RYAN>没错  我掏了你口袋
<35-12,RYAN>Yeah. I picked your pocket.

812
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,470
<35-12,RYAN>然后趁你不注意的时候
<35-12,RYAN>And then when you weren't looking,

813
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,300
<35-12,RYAN>我打给了我的搭档  让电话一直通着
<35-12,RYAN>I dialed my partner and left the line open.

814
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,840
<35-13,LIAM>不可能
<35-13,LIAM>No way.

815
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,420
<35-14,RYAN>我们要去哪儿  他听得清清楚楚
<35-14,RYAN>He heard exactly where we were going.

816
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,260
<35-16,LIAM>-连姆  -他在胡说  鲍比
<35-16,LIAM>- Liam. - He's full of crap, Bobby.

817
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,370
<35-17,RYAN>-他是吓唬我们  -是吗
<35-17,RYAN>- He's bluffing. - Oh, am I?

818
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,670
<35-17,RYAN>要不我们见见我的搭档吧
<35-17,RYAN>Why don't we meet my partner, huh?

819
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,980
<35-17,RYAN>喂  哈维尔  你在哪儿
<35-17,RYAN>Yo, Javi, where you at?!

820
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,480
<35-18,ESPOSITO>我在这儿  哥们
<35-18,ESPOSITO>Right here, bro.

821
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,790
<35-19,RYAN>别轻举妄动  他当过特种兵
<35-19,RYAN>No, no. He is former special forces.

822
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,120
<35-19,RYAN>你们不是他的对手
<35-19,RYAN>You do not want to draw on him.

823
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,830
<35-19,RYAN>还想见见其他伙伴吗
<35-19,RYAN>Want to meet the rest of my crew?

824
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,390
<35-19,RYAN>嘿  贝克特
<35-19,RYAN>Hey, Beckett!

825
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,090
<35-20,BECKETT>莱恩  是你打的电话吗
<35-20,BECKETT>You called, Ryan?

826
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,630
<35-21,RYAN>小子  别被她的美貌骗了
<35-21,RYAN>Don't let the looks fool you, boys.

827
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,450
<35-21,RYAN>你们也不是她的对手
<35-21,RYAN>You don't want to mess with her, either.

828
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,920
<35-21,RYAN>卡塞尔
<35-21,RYAN>Castle!

829
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,300
<35-22,CASTLE>不是吧  我没带防弹衣
<35-22,CASTLE>Seriously? I didn't... I didn't bring my vest.

830
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,890
<35-23,RYAN>放下武器  快
<35-23,RYAN>Drop your weapons. Now.

831
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,810
<35-24,BOBBY>我有全纽约最好的律师
<35-24,BOBBY>I got the best lawyer in New York.

832
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,460
<35-24,BOBBY>我会被无罪释放的
<35-24,BOBBY>I'm gonna walk.

833
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,980
<35-25,RYAN>联调局有了这个你跑不了
<35-25,RYAN>Not when I hand the Feds this.

834
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,680
<36-1,CASTLE>一看这华丽丽的西装三件套就知道
<36-1,CASTLE>Snazzy 3-piece suit could only mean one thing...

835
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,500
<36-1,CASTLE>莱恩回来了
<36-1,CASTLE>Ryan is back.

836
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,530
<36-2,RYAN>是啊  是啊
<36-2,RYAN>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

837
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,850
<36-3,RYAN>连姆审得怎样了
<36-3,RYAN>So where are we with Liam?

838
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,760
<36-4,ESPOSITO>贝克特正在审呢  想让他承认
<36-4,ESPOSITO>Beckett's got him in the box, trying to get him to confess

839
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,780
<36-4,ESPOSITO>自己杀了吉米·韦兰
<36-4,ESPOSITO>to Jimmy Whelan's murder.

840
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,260
<36-5,CASTLE>沃克探员来电说  那本圣经真是好东西
<36-5,CASTLE>And Agent Walker called. He said the bible you gave him is gold.

841
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,290
<36-5,CASTLE>鲍比·S和他的同伙们都完蛋了
<36-5,CASTLE>Bobby S and his whole crew are doing down.

842
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,660
<36-5,CASTLE>哈维尔
<36-5,CASTLE>And, uh, Javi...

843
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,930
<36-6,RYAN>那天在餐馆
<36-6,RYAN>The other day at the diner--

844
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,040
<36-7,ESPOSITO>没事儿  当时那不是你本人
<36-7,ESPOSITO>Don't sweat it. That wasn't you talkin', man.

845
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
<36-7,ESPOSITO>那是费顿
<36-7,ESPOSITO>That was Fenton.

846
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,290
<36-8,RYAN>谢谢理解
<36-8,RYAN>Yeah. Thanks.

847
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,320
<36-9,BECKETT>你们一定不信  但连姆确实不是凶手
<36-9,BECKETT>You guys aren't gonna believe this, But Liam is not our killer.

848
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,270
<36-10,ESPOSITO>你说什么  可那确实是他的地铁卡啊
<36-10,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about? It was his MetroCard.

849
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,020
<36-10,ESPOSITO>他是用自己的信用卡付钱的
<36-10,ESPOSITO>He paid for it with his own credit card,

850
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
<36-10,ESPOSITO>他从鲍比车上下来后刷过卡
<36-10,ESPOSITO>And then he swiped it after he dropped off Bobby's car.

851
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,440
<36-11,BECKETT>我知道  但他有不在场证明
<36-11,BECKETT>I know, but his alibi is solid.

852
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,430
<36-11,BECKETT>他当时在斯塔顿岛
<36-11,BECKETT>He was on Staten Island at that time.

853
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,560
<36-12,CASTLE>如果他有不在场证明
<36-12,CASTLE>Okay, well, if he has a solid alibi,

854
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,410
<36-12,CASTLE>唯一的问题就是
<36-12,CASTLE>the only question that remains is,

855
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,640
<36-12,CASTLE>谁能拿到他的地铁卡
<36-12,CASTLE>who had access to his MetroCard?

856
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,800
<36-12,CASTLE>玛吉
<36-12,CASTLE>Maggie...

857
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,970
<37-1,RYAN>我觉得你能干出很多事  但不会去杀人
<37-1,RYAN>You know, I pegged you for a lot of things, never a killer.

858
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,640
<37-2,MAGGIE>是啊  我也没想到你会是个缉毒大队长
<37-2,MAGGIE>Yeah, I pegged you for a lot of things, but never a narc.

859
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,830
<37-3,RYAN>其实我是凶杀案警探
<37-3,RYAN>Actually, see, I'm a homicide detective,

860
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,450
<37-3,RYAN>所以我知道你杀了烘焙师吉米
<37-3,RYAN>which is why I know that you killed Jimmy the Baker.

861
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,730
<37-4,MAGGIE>什么吉米
<37-4,MAGGIE>Jimmy the who?

862
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,960
<37-5,BECKETT>老天  你还要和我们玩下去吗
<37-5,BECKETT>Oh, god. Are we actually gonna play this game?

863
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,510
<37-5,BECKETT>不早了  我都累了
<37-5,BECKETT>It's late. I am tired.

864
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,260
<37-5,BECKETT>警察搜了你家  找到了你的枪
<37-5,BECKETT>Officers went through your house, And they found your gun.

865
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,450
<37-6,RYAN>和射杀吉米的枪口径一致
<37-6,RYAN>Same caliber that killed Jimmy.

866
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,590
<37-6,RYAN>迟早我们会查出两支枪弹道一致
<37-6,RYAN>It's only a matter of time before we get a ballistics match.

867
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,920
<38-1,CASTLE>这么说  连姆不知道他老婆做了什么
<38-1,CASTLE>So Liam had no idea what his wife was doing?

868
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,020
<38-2,BECKETT>对  都是玛吉干的
<38-2,BECKETT>No, it was all Maggie.

869
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,660
<38-2,BECKETT>她知道连姆忠心耿耿
<38-2,BECKETT>She knew that Liam was too loyal,

870
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,690
<38-2,BECKETT>她觉得只有她把鲍比·S送进监狱
<38-2,BECKETT>and she figured that if she could get Bobby S in prison,

871
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,460
<38-2,BECKETT>她丈夫才能称王
<38-2,BECKETT>her husband would ascend to the throne.

872
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,890
<38-3,CASTLE>看来玛吉就像《麦克白》里的麦克白夫人
<38-3,CASTLE>So really, lady Maggie was lady Macbeth,

873
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,320
<38-3,CASTLE>不过她是爱尔兰人  不是苏格兰人
<38-3,CASTLE>only she was Irish, not Scottish.

874
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,210
<38-4,CASTLE>凯特  说起乔丹
<38-4,CASTLE>Listen, Kate, about Jordan...

875
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,970
<38-5,BECKETT>如果你不想说的话  就别说了
<38-5,BECKETT>You know what? If, uh, if you don't want to talk about it--

876
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,860
<38-6,CASTLE>我想谈  不过
<38-6,CASTLE>No, I-I-I wanna, but...

877
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,620
<38-6,CASTLE>如果你不喜欢你看到的会怎样
<38-6,CASTLE>What happens if you don't like what you see?

878
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,760
<38-7,BECKETT>如果你不让我看到会怎样
<38-7,BECKETT>What happens if you don't let me look?

879
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,620
<38-8,CASTLE>乔丹汽车公司  在1916到1931年间生产汽车
<38-8,CASTLE>Jordan Motor Company. They made cars from 1916 to 1931.

880
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,690
<38-9,BECKETT>这就是乔丹  所谓的大秘密  一家倒闭的公司
<38-9,BECKETT>That's Jordan? That's the big secret, A defunct car company?

881
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,570
<38-10,CASTLE>算是吧  这得追溯到我在寄宿学校上学的时候
<38-10,CASTLE>Sort of. It goes back to my boarding school days.

882
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,910
<38-10,CASTLE>那是第一个学期  我差点儿被退学
<38-10,CASTLE>My first semester there, I was in danger of flunking out.

883
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:23,320
<38-10,CASTLE>我期末考必须拿A
<38-10,CASTLE>I needed an "A" on my term paper.

884
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,110
<38-11,BECKETT>所以你就围绕那家公司写了篇文章
<38-11,BECKETT>So you wrote the paper on that car company?

885
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:29,210
<38-12,CASTLE>不  是别人写的
<38-12,CASTLE>No. Someone else did,

886
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,020
<38-12,CASTLE>然后我给了他250美元
<38-12,CASTLE>and I paid him $250.

887
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,900
<38-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这是你小时候的事
<38-13,BECKETT>Um, Castle, that happened when you were a kid.

888
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,920
<38-13,BECKETT>我没搞懂这怎么改变我对你的看法了
<38-13,BECKETT>I don't understand why that would change how I see you.

889
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,450
<38-14,CASTLE>因为它改变我对自己的看法了
<38-14,CASTLE>Because it changed how I saw myself.

890
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,650
<38-14,CASTLE>老师在班上读了我的文章
<38-14,CASTLE>The teacher read the paper to the entire class

891
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,220
<38-14,CASTLE>当成了优秀范文  大家为我鼓了掌
<38-14,CASTLE>as an example of great writing, and they applauded.

892
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,090
<38-14,CASTLE>那是我第一次被表扬
<38-14,CASTLE>It was the first time I was celebrated ev--for anything,

893
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,340
<38-14,CASTLE>但却是个谎言
<38-14,CASTLE>And... it was a fraud.

894
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,220
<38-14,CASTLE>我是个骗子
<38-14,CASTLE>I... I was a fraud.

895
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,740
<38-14,CASTLE>从那时起  我开始学写作
<38-14,CASTLE>That's when I learned how to write.

896
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,450
<38-14,CASTLE>我写啊写
<38-14,CASTLE>I wrote and wrote,

897
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,980
<38-14,CASTLE>努力让自己成为大家称赞的那个人
<38-14,CASTLE>trying to be as great as everyone thought I was...

898
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,960
<38-14,CASTLE>努力赢取称赞
<38-14,CASTLE>trying to earn that applause.

899
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,990
<38-14,CASTLE>我现在仍在努力
<38-14,CASTLE>I'm still trying.

900
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,910
<38-15,BECKETT>你说得对  卡塞尔  这确实改变了我的看法
<38-15,BECKETT>You're right, Castle. It does change how I see you.

901
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,280
<38-16,BECKETT>让我更喜欢你了一点点
<38-16,BECKETT>It makes me like you just a little bit more.

902
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,880
<39-1,RYAN>别忘了胡子先生
<39-1,RYAN>Don't forget Mr. Whiskers.

903
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,900
<39-2,SIOBHAN>你现在倒是记得他的名字了
<39-2,SIOBHAN>Oh, so now you remember his name.

904
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,720
<39-3,RYAN>能让我俩聊会儿吗
<39-3,RYAN>Could you give us a second, please?

905
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,320
<39-4,SIOBHAN>我正惦记着你能不能来呢
<39-4,SIOBHAN>I was hoping you'd come.

906
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,640
<39-5,RYAN>这回我得道个别
<39-5,RYAN>I wanted to say good-bye this time.

907
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,520
<39-6,SIOBHAN>道别让我觉得以后再见不到你了
<39-6,SIOBHAN>"Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.

908
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,160
<39-6,SIOBHAN>确实啊
<39-6,SIOBHAN>You won't.

909
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,270
<39-7,RYAN>明天  你就会到一个新的城市  有个新的名字
