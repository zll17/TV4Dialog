<1-5,LANIE>When we get to this crime scene, do not wink at me,

8
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,540
<1-5,LANIE>不要对我笑
<1-5,LANIE>do not smile at me,

9
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,430
<1-5,LANIE>也别楚楚可怜地看我
<1-5,LANIE>and don't even look at me with those

10
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,560
<1-5,LANIE>明白吗
<1-5,LANIE>puppy dog eyes. Got it?

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,620
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>我不要再和你讨论这个话题了
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>I'm not having this conversation with you again.

14
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,610
<1-1,LANIE PARISH>我挂了  我在做正事呢
<1-1,LANIE PARISH>Well, I'm--I gotta go. I'm at work.

15
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,480
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>真的是正事
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>It is so work.

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,040
<2-2,ESPOSITO>怎么了 卡塞尔  什么事
<2-2,ESPOSITO>What's up, Castle? How's it going?

<2-3,CASTLE>给你个忠告
<2-3,CASTLE>You want my advice?

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,660
<2-3,CASTLE>千万别和自己的同事搞在一起
<2-3,CASTLE>Never sleep with someone you work with.

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,740
<2-4,ESPOSITO>什么  你什么意思
<2-4,ESPOSITO>What? What do you mean?

<2-5,CASTLE>Trust me. It doesn't end well.

21
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,680
<2-6,ESPOSITO>谁说的
<2-6,ESPOSITO>Who knows?

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,320
<2-7,CASTLE>大家都这么说
<2-7,CASTLE>Everyone knows.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,720
<2-8,BECKETT>大家都说什么
<2-8,BECKETT>Everyone knows what?

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,680
<2-9,CASTLE_ESPOSITO>没什么
<2-9,CASTLE_ESPOSITO>Nothing.

25
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,600
<2-10,ESPOSITO>马上就来
<2-10,ESPOSITO>On my way.

26
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,560
<2-11,BECKETT>没事吧  卡塞尔  郁郁寡欢的
<2-11,BECKETT>You okay, Castle? You seem upset.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,290
<2-12,CASTLE>没  没事  我很好  怎么了
<2-12,CASTLE>No, no, I'm fine. Why?

28
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,470
<2-13,BECKETT>没什么
<2-13,BECKETT>Okay.

29
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,800
<2-14,CASTLE>凶案竟然发生在德雷克魔术店
<2-14,CASTLE>The murder is here at Drake's magic shop?

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,590
<2-15,BECKETT>对
<2-15,BECKETT>Yep.

31
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,800
<2-16,CASTLE>我从13岁开始就老来这里
<2-16,CASTLE>I've been coming here since I was 13 years old.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,480
<2-16,CASTLE>这里就是男孩子的天堂
<2-16,CASTLE>This place is a paradise for boys--

33
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,470
<2-16,CASTLE>这有放屁坐垫  魔术把戏  假呕吐物
<2-16,CASTLE>Whoopee cushions, magic tricks, fake vomit.

34
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,230
<2-17,BECKETT>不只是男孩子的天堂  卡塞尔
<2-17,BECKETT>It's not just for boys, Castle.

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,000
<2-17,BECKETT>我祖父是个业余魔术师
<2-17,BECKETT>My grandfather was an amateur magician,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,290
<2-17,BECKETT>我十几岁的时候
<2-17,BECKETT>and I used to come here almost every Sunday afternoon

37
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,100
<2-17,BECKETT>几乎每个周末下午都来这
<2-17,BECKETT>when I was that age, too.

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,220
<2-18,CASTLE>从没想过你也会痴迷魔术
<2-18,CASTLE>I never pegged you for a magic fan.

39
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,860
<2-18,CASTLE>有什么拿手的把戏
<2-18,CASTLE>You know any good tricks?

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,740
<2-19,BECKETT>我有一个拿手把戏
<2-19,BECKETT>I do this one thing

41
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,740
<2-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔的扮演者曾在记者会上用冰块搞笑
<2-19,BECKETT>详情请google"castle icecube"

42
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,350
<2-19,BECKETT>就是大变冰块
<2-19,BECKETT>with ice cubes.

43
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,410
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>从死者身上浸水的钱包来看
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>According to his water-soaked wallet,

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,070
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>死者是店主扎尔曼·德雷克
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>the victim's Zalman Drake, the shop owner.

45
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,340
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>早晨他的助手伊莱扎·温特开店时
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>His assistant, Eliza Winter, found him in the tank

46
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,030
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>在水箱里发现了他
<3-1,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>when she opened up the store this morning.

47
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,280
<3-2,BECKETT>有没有任何强行进入的痕迹
<3-2,BECKETT>Any signs of forced entry?

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,580
<3-3,RYAN>-没有  -知道吗  我很难理解
<3-3,RYAN>- No. - You know, it is beyond me

49
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,130
<3-4,LANIE>为什么大家会觉得这很有意思
<3-4,LANIE>why people think this is entertaining.

50
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,460
<3-4,LANIE>我看到的只是一个倒挂在水箱里的人
<3-4,LANIE>I see a guy hanging upside down in a water tank,

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,060
<3-4,LANIE>我觉得这很愚蠢
<3-4,LANIE>I think, you are a fool.

52
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:42,670
<3-5,CASTLE>这些奶罐和水刑箱
<3-5,CASTLE>Hmm. See the milk cans and the water torture tank,

53
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,660
<3-5,CASTLE>它们的出现真正改变了整个魔术界
<3-5,CASTLE>they were real game changers in the magic world.

54
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,120
<3-5,CASTLE>它们首次呈现了
<3-5,CASTLE>They were the first presentation

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,440
<3-5,CASTLE>现实生活中的生死关联
<3-5,CASTLE>of real life-and-death consequences.

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,260
<3-5,CASTLE>魔术师停止呼吸的同时
<3-5,CASTLE>As the magician held his breath,

57
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,620
<3-5,CASTLE>观众也屏住了呼吸
<3-5,CASTLE>so did the audience.

58
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,630
<3-6,LANIE>但是这位魔术师要想成功谢幕
<3-6,LANIE>well, this magician would've had to hold his breath

59
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,850
<3-6,LANIE>就要屏住呼吸八到十个小时
<3-6,LANIE>eight to ten hours if he wanted to take a bow.

60
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,990
<3-7,BECKETT>你推测死亡时间是午夜十二点到凌晨两点
<3-7,BECKETT>So you're saying between 12:00 and 2:00 A.M.?

61
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,460
<3-8,LANIE>应该如此
<3-8,LANIE>Looks that way,

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,900
<3-8,LANIE>死者眼睛的淤血显示是溺水死亡
<3-8,LANIE>petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes indicate drowning.

63
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,140
<3-9,CASTLE>难道是逃跑失败
<3-9,CASTLE>Failed escape attempt?

64
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,250
<3-10,LANIE>死者倒挂的脚踝处
<3-10,LANIE>Well, there's no redness around his ankles

65
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,310
<3-10,LANIE>没有淤血
<3-10,LANIE>where he was hanging.

66
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,740
<3-10,LANIE>说明他没有挣扎逃脱
<3-10,LANIE>Doesn't look like he struggled to get out.

67
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,630
<3-10,LANIE>我推测他在入水之前就已死亡
<3-10,LANIE>I have a feeling he was dead before he hit the water,

68
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,720
<3-10,LANIE>但是需要回实验室做进一步确认检查
<3-10,LANIE>but I won't know for sure until I get him back to the lab.

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
<3-11,ESPOSITO>也许他没有挣扎另有原因
<3-11,ESPOSITO>Maybe there's another reason he didn't struggle.

70
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,540
<3-11,ESPOSITO>一张自杀留言
<3-11,ESPOSITO>Suicide note.

71
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,880
<3-11,ESPOSITO>说他陷入财务危机
<3-11,ESPOSITO>It says he was in financial trouble

72
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,850
<3-11,ESPOSITO>不忍看到家传老店丧失其手
<3-11,ESPOSITO>and couldn't bear the thought of losing his family's shop,

73
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,040
<3-11,ESPOSITO>所以自杀
<3-11,ESPOSITO>so he was gonna kill himself.

74
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,310
<3-12,ELIZA WINTER>德雷克先生不是自杀的
<3-12,ELIZA WINTER>Mr Drake did not kill himself.

75
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,420
<3-13,BECKETT>-你怎么知道  -我就是知道
<3-13,BECKETT>- How do you know? - I just know.

76
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,400
<3-14,ELIZA>那他的店要破产  这是真的吗
<3-14,ELIZA>Is it true, though? Was he gonna lose his shop?

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,740
<3-15,CASTLE>不是
<3-15,CASTLE>No.

78
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,300
<3-16,ELIZA>我是说  是的
<3-16,ELIZA>I mean, yes,

79
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,810
<3-16,ELIZA>但是两周前  他告诉我
<3-16,ELIZA>but two weeks ago, he told me

80
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,700
<3-16,ELIZA>一切都很顺利
<3-16,ELIZA>that everything was fine,

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,950
<3-16,ELIZA>他都已经解决了
<3-16,ELIZA>that he had worked it all out.

82
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,200
<3-17,BECKETT>知道怎么解决的吗
<3-17,BECKETT>Any idea how?

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,620
<3-17,BECKETT>意外之财  还是有人赞助
<3-17,BECKETT>Was there a windfall or an investor?

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,210
<3-18,ELIZA>他没说
<3-18,ELIZA>He didn't say.

85
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,100
<3-19,BECKETT>他之前能自己倒挂在那个水箱里吗
<3-19,BECKETT>Would he have been able to place himself in that tank?

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
<3-20,ELIZA>完全没问题
<3-20,ELIZA>Absolutely.

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,730
<3-20,ELIZA>但是他不会这么做  扎尔曼不会
<3-20,ELIZA>But he wouldn't have. Not Zalman.

88
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,180
<3-20,ELIZA>他太热爱魔术  太尊敬魔术了
<3-20,ELIZA>He loved and respected magic too much.

89
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,990
<3-21,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  这没有签名
<3-21,BECKETT>Esposito, there's no signature here.

90
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,670
<3-22,ESPOSITO>我让鉴证组检测一下指纹
<3-22,ESPOSITO>I'll have C.S.U. run it for prints.

91
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,290
<3-23,BECKETT>让他们把水箱还有入口和出口也查一下
<3-23,BECKETT>Have them run the tank and the entries and exits as well.

92
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:00,550
<3-23,BECKETT>是
<3-23,BECKETT>Okay.

93
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,050
<4-1,BECKETT>你最后一次见到他是什么时候
<4-1,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw him?

94
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,000
<4-2,ELIZA>昨天上午  他吃完午饭就离开了
<4-2,ELIZA>Yesterday morning. He left right after lunch,

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,670
<4-2,ELIZA>之后就再也没见到过他
<4-2,ELIZA>and he was gone the rest of the day.

96
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,910
<4-3,BECKETT>他有说他要去哪吗
<4-3,BECKETT>Did he say where he was going?

97
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,750
<4-4,CASTLE>他平时也会在
<4-4,CASTLE>Was it normal for him to leave

98
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,900
<4-4,CASTLE>中午离开店里吗
<4-4,CASTLE>the shop in the middle of the day?

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,490
<4-5,ELIZA>是的  有时候会
<4-5,ELIZA>Yeah. He would do that sometimes.

100
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,430
<4-6,BECKETT>你有没有发现他有什么异常举动
<4-6,BECKETT>Did you notice any changes in his behavior

101
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,180
<4-6,BECKETT>或者生活中有什么和往常不一样的吗
<4-6,BECKETT>or anything unusual going on in his life?

102
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,710
<4-7,ELIZA>上个月  他经常离开店里
<4-7,ELIZA>This past month, he was gone m-more often.

103
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,860
<4-7,ELIZA>他只是说  他正在处理一些事情
<4-7,ELIZA>All he'd say was that he was working on something.

104
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,600
<4-7,ELIZA>但他看起来有点累  好像根本没有休息
<4-7,ELIZA>But he looked a little tired, like he hadn't been sleeping.

105
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,640
<4-8,BECKETT>知道为什么会这样吗
<4-8,BECKETT>Can you think of any reason for the change?

106
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,530
<4-9,ELIZA>是的  上个月  在所有这些发生之前
<4-9,ELIZA>Yes. Last month, right before all this started,

107
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,160
<4-9,ELIZA>一个男子来到店里  打了德雷克先生
<4-9,ELIZA>a guy came into the shop and attacked Mr. Drake.

108
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,470
<4-9,ELIZA>把他推倒  砸破了表演箱
<4-9,ELIZA>He pushed him right through a display case.

109
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,910
<4-9,ELIZA>那个人警告他最好小心点
<4-9,ELIZA>He said he better watch his back,

110
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,370
<4-9,ELIZA>因为他会想尽办法起诉德雷克先生
<4-9,ELIZA>and he was gonna sue him for all he was worth.

111
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,670
<5-1,BECKETT>谢谢  我等您消息
<5-1,BECKETT>Thank you. I will hold.

112
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,460
<5-1,BECKETT>法院记录显示一个月前
<5-1,BECKETT>So court records show that

113
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,480
<5-1,BECKETT>确实有一场针对扎尔曼·德雷克的诉讼案
<5-1,BECKETT>a lawsuit was filed against Zalman Drake a month ago.

114
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,190
<5-1,BECKETT>他们现在正在查  嘿
<5-1,BECKETT>They're pulling it up now. Hey.

115
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,220
<5-3,RYAN>嘿  我们检查了魔术店周围的区域
<5-3,RYAN>Hey. We canvassed the area around the magic shop.

116

<5-4,BECKETT>I'd like to know what he was doing

122
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,320
<5-4,BECKETT>他都做了什么

131
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,870
<6-1,RYAN>好像有人有自己的小秘密了
<6-1,RYAN>Looks like somebody has a secret.

132
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,320
<6-2,ESPOSITO>秘密  什么秘密
<6-2,ESPOSITO>A secret? Uh, what secret?

<6-3,RYAN>我能理解有些事情是不想和别人分享的
<6-3,RYAN>I can understand a guy not wanting to share.

134
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,560
<6-3,RYAN>我是说  有些事情确实很私人
<6-3,RYAN>I mean, some things are personal.

135
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,770
<6-4,ESPOSITO>你怎么发现的
<6-4,ESPOSITO>How did you find out?

139
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,140
<6-6,ESPOSITO>"出版商和神秘作家
<6-6,ESPOSITO>"Looks like an unhappy ending for

140
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,140
<6-6,ESPOSITO>将不欢而散"
<6-6,ESPOSITO>the publisher and the mystery writer."

141
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,180
<6-7,RYAN>很明显
<6-7,RYAN>Apparently,

142
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,690
<6-7,RYAN>他和吉娜  这位前妻加前女友加出版商
<6-7,RYAN>he and ex-wife/girlfriend/ publisher Gina

143
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,540
<6-7,RYAN>在"马戏团"餐厅吵架了  大吵了一架
<6-7,RYAN>had some words--loud words-- at le cirque,

144
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,930
<6-7,RYAN>吉娜大发雷霆
<6-7,RYAN>and she stormed off.

145
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,050
<6-8,ESPOSITO>原来上午他谈的就是这事
<6-8,ESPOSITO>That's what he was talking about this morning.

146
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,550
<6-9,RYAN>我不理解的是  为什么他想要
<6-9,RYAN>What I don't understand is why he would try

147
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,940
<6-9,RYAN>瞒着我们  我是说
<6-9,RYAN>to hide it from us. I mean,

148
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,200
<6-9,RYAN>我们就像是一家人一样
<6-9,RYAN>we're like family.

149
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,330
<6-10,ESPOSITO>也许他在意别人的看法
<6-10,ESPOSITO>Maybe he's afraid of what we might think.

150
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,400
<7-1,BECKETT>扎尔曼·德雷克确实曾经面临一场官司
<7-1,BECKETT>So it turns out a lawsuit was filed against Zalman Drake

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,910
<7-1,BECKETT>原告叫做杰罗姆·阿斯彭纳
<7-1,BECKETT>by a Jerome Aspenall.

152
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,300
<7-1,BECKETT>再听听这个
<7-1,BECKETT>And get this--

153
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,310
<7-1,BECKETT>法官昨天驳回了他的上诉
<7-1,BECKETT>the judge threw it out yesterday.

154
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,710
<7-2,CASTLE>也许杰罗姆决定自己替天行道了
<7-2,CASTLE>Maybe Jerome decided to take justice into his own hands.

155
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,520
<7-2,CASTLE>因为何事起诉被害人
<7-2,CASTLE>What was he suing him for?

156
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,940
<7-2,CASTLE>扎尔曼·德雷克  我告他诽谤
<7-2,CASTLE>Zalman Drake? I was suing him for slander,

<7-2,CASTLE>毁损名誉  毁掉了我的生活
<7-2,CASTLE>defamation of character, ruining my life.

158
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,580
<8-1,JEROME>杰罗姆  扎尔曼做了什么
<8-1,JEROME>And how did Zalman do that, Jerome?

159
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,190
<8-2,BECKETT>他他妈的读懂了我的想法
<8-2,BECKETT>He read my friggin' mind,

160
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,010
<8-3,JEROME>当着300个人的面
<8-3,JEROME>In front of, like, 300 people.

161
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,920
<8-4,CASTLE>表演魔术吗
<8-4,CASTLE>During a magic performance?

162
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,260
<8-5,JEROME>是啊  在奇奇慈善舞会
<8-5,JEROME>Yeah. It was like this mind reading,

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,750
<8-5,JEROME>我就想  免费的食物  娱乐节目
<8-5,JEROME>and I figured, free food, some entertainment,

166
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,030
<8-5,JEROME>说不定还能中大奖  结果刚好相反
<8-5,JEROME>maybe later, I get lucky. Turns out not so lucky.

167
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,630
<8-6,BECKETT>-你能详细说说吗  -当然
<8-6,BECKETT>- Could you elaborate on that? - Yeah,

168

<8-7,JEROME>makes this rich dude disappear and reappear,

170
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,840
<8-7,JEROME>我就想"挺酷啊"
<8-7,JEROME>and I'm like, "Oh, that's cool."

171
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,420
<8-7,JEROME>之后他邀请志愿者上台  我妻子举起了我的手
<8-7,JEROME>Then he asks for volunteers. My wife raises my hand

172
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,750
<8-7,JEROME>说"上去玩玩  很有趣的"  于是我上台了  德雷克说
<8-7,JEROME>and says "Go up there, it'll be fun," So I do. Drake says,

173
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,770
<8-7,JEROME>"站在我对面  想一些好事"  我就想了
<8-7,JEROME>"Stand across from me and think good thoughts," So I do.

174
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,280
<8-7,JEROME>他看着我  集中注意力
<8-7,JEROME>He looks at me, concentrates,

175
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,820
<8-7,JEROME>把手放到我额头
<8-7,JEROME>puts his fingers on my forehead,

<8-9,JEROME>是的  但是我竭力不去想
<8-9,JEROME>Yeah, but I was trying not to,

180
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,680
<8-9,JEROME>-因为最倒霉的是  -你的老婆不叫芮塔
<8-9,JEROME>- 'cause here's the kicker-- - Your wife's name isn't rita.

181
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,960

<8-11,JEROME>岳父解雇了我  芮塔也不愿跟我说话
<8-11,JEROME>my father-in-law fired me, and Rita won't even talk to me

184
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,920
<8-11,JEROME>因为我老婆找到了她的电话  跟她通了话
<8-11,JEROME>'cause my wife found her number and called her.

185
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,060

<8-12,BECKETT>Where were you last night between 12:00 and 2:00?

186
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,360
<8-13,JEROME>她为什么问我这个问题
<8-13,JEROME>Why is she asking me that?

187
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,360
<8-14,CASTLE>-她想知道你是否有不在场证明  -什么不在场证明
<8-14,CASTLE>- Well, she wants to know if you have an alibi. - For what?

<8-16,BECKETT>扎尔曼·德雷克昨晚被谋杀了
<8-16,BECKETT>Zalman Drake was murdered last night.

189
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,490
<8-17,JEROME>正义得到伸张
<8-17,JEROME>Justice is served.

190
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,640
<8-18,CASTLE>在他做读心术的时候  用了很长时间吗
<8-18,CASTLE>When he read your mind, did it take him very long?

191
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,130
<8-20,CASTLE>-不  没有  -不是吗
<8-20,CASTLE>- No, he--no. No. - Didn't think so.

192
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,930
<8-21,BECKETT>杰罗姆  我们有证人证明你去过他的商店
<8-21,BECKETT>Jerome, we have a witness who says you went to his shop,

193
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,850
<8-21,BECKETT>袭击并恐吓了扎尔曼·德雷克
<8-21,BECKETT>attacked, and threatened Zalman Drake.

194
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,760
<8-21,BECKETT>当他们昨天驳回你的上诉时
<8-21,BECKETT>When they dropped your lawsuit yesterday,

195
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,240
<8-21,BECKETT>你是不是决定自己伸张正义
<8-21,BECKETT>did you decide to take the law into your own hands?

196
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,410
<8-21,BECKETT>你是不是去了魔术用品店  谋杀了扎尔曼
<8-21,BECKETT>Did you go to the magic shop and murder Zalman?

197
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,720
<8-22,JEROME>不  我昨晚哪都没去
<8-22,JEROME>No, I didn't go anywhere last night

198
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,820
<8-22,JEROME>我只去了57街和第七街交口的奥拉汉酒吧
<8-22,JEROME>except for O'Lannahan's at 57th and seventh,

199
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,140
<8-22,JEROME>因为被那个扎尔曼·德雷克害的  我赔了夫人
<8-22,JEROME>because thanks to Zalman Drake, I no longer have a wife

200
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,470
<8-22,JEROME>又折了情妇
<8-22,JEROME>or a mistress to go home to.

201
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,600
<9-1,CASTLE>我想知道扎尔曼是怎么做到的
<9-1,CASTLE>Wonder how Zalman did it.

202
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
<9-1,CASTLE>他肯定是从杰罗姆的口袋里拿出了
<9-1,CASTLE>He must have lifted something from Jerome's pocket

203
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,400
<9-1,CASTLE>证明他出轨的收据之类的
<9-1,CASTLE>with a receipt from his weekend of sin.

204
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,360
<9-2,BECKETT>这样吗
<9-2,BECKETT>Like this?

205
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,360
<9-3,CASTLE>你的手伸进了我的口袋  我却没有感觉到
<9-3,CASTLE>You had your hand in my pocket, and I didn't even feel it?

206
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,650
<9-3,CASTLE>再来一次
<9-3,CASTLE>Do it again.

208
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,850
<9-4,CASTLE>怎么了
<9-4,CASTLE>What?

209
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,520
<9-5,BECKETT>莱恩
<9-5,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan.

210
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,030
<9-5,BECKETT>找到扎尔曼昨天
<9-5,BECKETT>Any luck narrowing down Zalman's

211
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,250
<9-5,BECKETT>去了什么地方吗
<9-5,BECKETT>whereabouts yesterday?

212
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,590
<9-6,RYAN>没有
<9-6,RYAN>Uh, not yet,

213
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,160
<9-6,RYAN>但是我查了杰罗姆昨晚的去处
<9-6,RYAN>but I did check into Jerome's whereabouts last night.

214
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,310
<9-6,RYAN>奥拉汉酒吧的酒保说
<9-6,RYAN>The barkeeper at O'lannahan's said

215
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,460
<9-6,RYAN>他一直待到关门才走
<9-6,RYAN>he was there till closing.

216
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,440
<9-6,RYAN>他给他叫了出租车
<9-6,RYAN>He called him a cab.

217
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,720
<9-7,CASTLE>这么说他昨晚唯一杀死的就是脑细胞
<9-7,CASTLE>So the only thing he killed last night were his brain cells.

218
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,720
<9-8,RYAN>另外  鉴证组在水箱和器具上
<9-8,RYAN>And a forensic sweep of the water tank came up negative

219
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,380
<9-8,RYAN>也没有找到
<9-8,RYAN>for any prints on the operating

220
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,360
<9-8,RYAN>除了扎尔曼以外的任何指纹
<9-8,RYAN>apparatus other than Zalman's.

221
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,780
<9-9,BECKETT>所以要么他是自杀
<9-9,BECKETT>So either he committed suicide...

222
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,950
<9-10,CASTLE>要么杀手戴了手套
<9-10,CASTLE>Or the killer wore gloves.

223
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,950
<9-11,ESPOSITO>没有一直戴着  根据报告
<9-11,ESPOSITO>Not the whole time. According to the lab,

224
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,150
<9-11,ESPOSITO>遗书上都是指纹
<9-11,ESPOSITO>there were fingerprints all over that suicide note,

225
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,920
<9-11,ESPOSITO>既不是扎尔曼也不是杰罗姆的指纹
<9-11,ESPOSITO>and they weren't Zalman's or Jerome's.

226
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,850
<9-12,BECKETT>找到匹配记录吗
<9-12,BECKETT>Did you get a match?

<9-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, to a Charles "Chuck" Russell.

228

<9-13,ESPOSITO>A low-life street magician

<9-14,BECKETT>-因为爆炸指控  -他认识被害人吗
<9-14,BECKETT>- an explosives charge. - Did he know our victim?

232
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,210
<9-15,ESPOSITO>是的  扎尔曼是美国魔术师协会里
<9-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, apparently Zalman is some big muckety-muck

233
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,500
<9-15,ESPOSITO>很重要的人物
<9-15,ESPOSITO>with the American Magicians Guild.

234
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,740
<9-15,ESPOSITO>他们有自己的行规
<9-15,ESPOSITO>They have a code of professional conduct,

235
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,970
<9-15,ESPOSITO>查克打破了规矩
<9-15,ESPOSITO>and Chuck broke it.

236
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,210
<9-15,ESPOSITO>他对于表演中的烟火表演非常不计后果
<9-15,ESPOSITO>He was reckless with pyrotechnics in his act,

237
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,770
<9-15,ESPOSITO>弄伤了他的助理  扎尔曼把他踢出协会
<9-15,ESPOSITO>injured his assistant, so Zalman had him kicked out.

238
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,890
<9-15,ESPOSITO>从那之后他一直没能签到大的演出机会
<9-15,ESPOSITO>He hasn't been able to book a gig since.

239
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,080
<9-16,BECKETT>在哪能找到他
<9-16,BECKETT>Where can we find him?

241
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,630
<10-1,CHUCK>她想让我把他的丈夫消失
<10-1,CHUCK>She wants me to make her husband disappear.

242
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,480
<10-1,CHUCK>那是重罪  我不能那样做
<10-1,CHUCK>That's a felony. I can't do that.

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,960
<10-1,CHUCK>但是我可以把这块表弄没
<10-1,CHUCK>But I can make the watch disappear.

244
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,970
<10-1,CHUCK>来点掌声
<10-1,CHUCK>Give it up.

245
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,000
<10-2,CHUCK>谢谢你  布兰达

<10-2,CHUCK>I'll dine on Raman and tap water tonight and think of you.

248
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,100
<10-2,CHUCK>你呢  你有什么捐给
<10-2,CHUCK>What about you? You got a little something

<11-1,CHUCK>干嘛把我带到这里
<11-1,CHUCK>Why am I here?

259
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,000
<11-2,BECKETT>认出这个了吗
<11-2,BECKETT>You recognize this?

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,060
<11-3,CHUCK>那是一个袋子装着一封信
<11-3,CHUCK>That's a baggie and that's a letter.

261
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
<11-3,CHUCK>下个问题
<11-3,CHUCK>Next.

262
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,920
<11-4,CASTLE>小心点  小查  下个问题就是谋杀指控了
<11-4,CASTLE>Careful, Chucky. Next could be a murder charge.

263
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,210
<11-5,BECKETT>-你的指纹在这封信上  -那又如何
<11-5,BECKETT>- Your fingerprints are on it. - So?

264
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,880
<11-6,CHUCK>我觉得在别人的遗书上
<11-6,CHUCK>So I find it strange that someone else's fingerprints

265
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,170
<11-7,BECKETT>找到其他人的指纹非常奇怪
<11-7,BECKETT>are on another guy's suicide note.

266
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,220
<11-8,CHUCK>你在说什么
<11-8,CHUCK>What are you talking about?

267
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,580
<11-9,CASTLE>你的老朋友扎尔曼·德雷克
<11-9,CASTLE>Your old friend Zalman Drake.

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,960
<11-11,CHUCK>是啊  就是他
<11-11,CHUCK>Yeah, that's him.

270
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,580
<11-11,CHUCK>他自杀了吗
<11-11,CHUCK>He killed himself?

271
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,690
<11-12,BECKETT>-天呐  -我们发现
<11-12,BECKETT>- Man. - We found him drowned

272
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,980
<11-12,BECKETT>他淹死在他商店的水刑箱里
<11-12,BECKETT>in the water torture trick in his shop.

273
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,590
<11-13,CASTLE>你肯定觉得自己很聪明吧
<11-13,CASTLE>You must have thought you were pretty clever,

274
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,560
<11-13,CASTLE>把一切弄得像是拙劣的逃生术一样
<11-13,CASTLE>staging it to look like a botched escape.

275
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,770
<11-14,CHUCK>我什么都没弄  跟我没关系
<11-14,CHUCK>I didn't stage anything. I had nothing to do with it.

276
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,400
<11-15,BECKETT>那你解释一下为什么你的指纹在这上面
<11-15,BECKETT>Well, then maybe you can explain your prints on that.

277
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,520
<11-16,BECKETT>好吧
<11-16,BECKETT>All right.

278
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,190
<11-18,CHUCK>等等  好吧  听着  我给了他这张条
<11-18,CHUCK>No, wait. Okay, listen, I-I-I gave him this note.

279
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,080
<11-19,BECKETT>你给了他这遗言
<11-19,BECKETT>You gave him a suicide note?

280
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,840
<11-20,CHUCK>不是这个
<11-20,CHUCK>Not that note.

281
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,600
<11-20,CHUCK>是纸上另外一张条  你看不见的那条
<11-20,CHUCK>The other note on the paper. The one you can't see.

282
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,660
<11-20,CHUCK>在紫外光灯下看看
<11-20,CHUCK>Hold it under a black light.

283
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,550
<11-21,CHUCK>是服务的报酬清单
<11-21,CHUCK>It's an invoice for services rendered.

284
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,110
<11-22,BECKETT>什么服务
<11-22,BECKETT>What kind of services?

285
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,850
<11-23,CHUCK>他想让我帮他找到一样东西
<11-23,CHUCK>He wanted me to get him something,

286
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,620
<11-23,CHUCK>非法的东西
<11-23,CHUCK>Something illegal.

287
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,850
<11-24,BECKETT>C4炸药
<11-24,BECKETT>C4 explosives?

288
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,120
<11-25,CHUCK>很讽刺  是吧
<11-25,CHUCK>Ironic, right?

289
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,930
<11-25,CHUCK>他想从我这要炸药
<11-25,CHUCK>He wants explosives from me

290
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,730
<11-25,CHUCK>而正是因为炸药他把我踢出协会
<11-25,CHUCK>when that's what he got me booted for.

291
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,000
<11-25,CHUCK>但是他保证让我重新入会
<11-25,CHUCK>but he promised to get me reinstated in the guild,

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,510
<11-26,BECKETT>-我迫切想找到工作  -不管是谁
<11-26,BECKETT>- and I wanted to work. - Whoever wrote this note

293
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,550
<11-26,BECKETT>写的这张遗言肯定以为是拿了张白纸
<11-26,BECKETT>probably thought they took a blank piece of paper.

294
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,310
<11-27,CHUCK>反正那个人不是我
<11-27,CHUCK>Whoever being not me.

295
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,280
<11-28,BECKETT>你给他提供的炸药
<11-28,BECKETT>You provided him with enough c4

296
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,500
<11-28,BECKETT>足够炸掉半个街区了
<11-28,BECKETT>to blow up half a city block.

297
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,850
<11-29,CHUCK>-干什么用  -也许是魔术表演用
<11-29,CHUCK>- What was it for? - Maybe it was for a magic trick.

298
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,760
<11-30,BECKETT>得了吧
<11-30,BECKETT>Come on.

<11-31,CHUCK>Nah, listen, Zalman didn't just run the shop

300
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,760
<11-31,CHUCK>做做商业表演
<11-31,CHUCK>and do corporate gigs.

301
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,600
<11-31,CHUCK>他也是个天才的魔术设计师
<11-31,CHUCK>He was also this genius trick designer.

302
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,190
<11-31,CHUCK>有传言说  他为如今最红的魔术师
<11-31,CHUCK>Rumor has it, he was creating

303
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,150
<11-31,CHUCK>打造了表演用的最尖端的魔术
<11-31,CHUCK>cutting-edge illusions for the hottest guy out there.

304
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,750
<11-32,BECKETT>谁是最红的魔术师
<11-32,BECKETT>And who is the hottest guy out there?

305
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,770
<12-1,CASTLE>图比斯·斯瑞奇  他可是魔术界的约翰尼·戴普
<12-1,CASTLE>Tobias Strange? He's the Johnny Depp of magic.

<13-3,TOBIAS>是谁让他进来的
<13-3,TOBIAS>Who the hell let them in here?!

336
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,620
<13-4,BECKETT>通行证在此
<13-4,BECKETT>All-access pass.

337
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,830
<14-1,TOBIAS>自继承了他爸爸的店子以来
<14-1,TOBIAS>Zalman has been the heart

338
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,470
<14-1,TOBIAS>扎尔曼一直都是
<14-1,TOBIAS>of the New York magic community

339
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,710
<14-1,TOBIAS>纽约魔术协会的核心成员
<14-1,TOBIAS>since he inherited the shop from his dad.

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,910
<14-1,TOBIAS>这可是个巨大的损失
<14-1,TOBIAS>It's a huge loss.

341
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,470
<14-2,BECKETT>我知道他在为你做事
<14-2,BECKETT>I understand that he worked for you.

342
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,000
<14-3,TOBIAS>以前是  但上个月我们分道扬镳了
<14-3,TOBIAS>He used to. We parted ways last month.

343
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,070
<14-4,BECKETT>-为什么  -我听一个卖家说
<14-4,BECKETT>-Why?  - I heard from one of my vendors

344
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,280
<14-5,TOBIAS>他可能还在替别人做事
<14-5,TOBIAS>that he might be working for someone else,

345
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,400
<14-5,TOBIAS>于是就去质问他  结果发现  他被挖走了
<14-5,TOBIAS>so I confronted him. Turns out, he was poached.

346
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,350
<14-6,BECKETT>-知道是被谁挖走的吗  -他没说
<14-6,BECKETT>- Do you know by whom?  - He didn't say.

347
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,440
<14-7,TOBIAS>扎尔曼做我的
<14-7,TOBIAS>Look, Zalman had been

348
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,010
<14-7,TOBIAS>专用设计师和工程师已经15年了
<14-7,TOBIAS>my exclusive designer and engineer for 15 years.

349
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,790
<14-7,TOBIAS>他创造了几个我最著名的魔术
<14-7,TOBIAS>He created some of my most famous tricks.

350
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,580
<14-7,TOBIAS>如果有机会上台演出的话
<14-7,TOBIAS>If he had any stage presence,

351
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,260
<14-7,TOBIAS>他会成为一个世界一流的魔术师
<14-7,TOBIAS>he would've been a world-class magician himself.

352
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,290
<14-8,CASTLE>这么多年后  他的离开
<14-8,CASTLE>Well, it must have been very upsetting

353
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,530
<14-8,CASTLE>肯定是一件让人很心痛的事
<14-8,CASTLE>to have him leave after all those years.

354
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,800
<14-8,CASTLE>这样一来你那些小秘密岂不是有被暴露的危险
<14-8,CASTLE>Didn't that put some of your trade secrets at risk?

355
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,220
<14-9,TOBIAS>卡塞尔先生  你这是在暗暗指控我呢
<14-9,TOBIAS>A thinly veiled accusation, Mr. Castle.

356
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,870
<14-9,TOBIAS>我当然心痛了
<14-9,TOBIAS>Of course I was upset.

357
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,000
<14-9,TOBIAS>但我从没怀疑过他行事谨慎的作风
<14-9,TOBIAS>But I never doubted his discretion.

358
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,520
<14-10,BECKETT>斯瑞奇先生  你有没有哪些魔术
<14-10,BECKETT>Mr. Strange, did any of your illusions

359
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,400
<14-10,BECKETT>需要借助爆炸物的呢
<14-10,BECKETT>require the use of an explosive?

360
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,770
<14-11,TOBIAS>"雾中幻境"一词
<14-11,TOBIAS>The term "Smoke and mirrors"

361
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,220
<14-11,TOBIAS>在我们这一行里可不是说着好听的  警探
<14-11,TOBIAS>isn't metaphoric in our business, detective.

362
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,010
<14-11,TOBIAS>很多错觉都是由光影造成的
<14-11,TOBIAS>Much of misdirection depends on flashes of light.

363
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,350
<14-12,BECKETT>是否要用到C-4呢
<14-12,BECKETT>What about C-4?

364
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,070
<14-13,TOBIAS>使事情看起来很危险的关键
<14-13,TOBIAS>The key to making something look dangerous

365
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,310
<14-13,TOBIAS>就是要牢牢掌控道具的效果
<14-13,TOBIAS>is to have complete control over the outcome.

366
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,190
<14-13,TOBIAS>C-4太不稳定了  无法把握
<14-13,TOBIAS>C-4 is too volatile, unpredictable.

367
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,270
<14-13,TOBIAS>它会造成伤亡
<14-13,TOBIAS>It kills.

368
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,260
<14-14,CASTLE>知道扎尔曼会用它来干什么吗
<14-14,CASTLE>Any idea what Zalman would be using it for?

369
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,250
<14-15,TOBIAS>肯定和魔术无关  我敢保证
<14-15,TOBIAS>Nothing magical, I assure you.

370
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,580
<14-15,TOBIAS>你们检查过他的工作室没
<14-15,TOBIAS>Have you checked his workshop?

371
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,730
<14-16,BECKETT>我们没发现有工作室
<14-16,BECKETT>Uh, we haven't come across a workshop.

372
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,720
<14-17,CASTLE>有可能他离开店铺后就是去了那儿
<14-17,CASTLE>It's probably where he'd been disappearing to every day.

373
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,260
<14-18,BECKETT>你知道在哪儿吗
<14-18,BECKETT>Do you know where it is?

374
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,270
<14-19,TOBIAS>你们应该知道魔术师对隐私都很保密的
<14-19,TOBIAS>You know how magicians are about secrets.

375
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,350
<14-19,TOBIAS>但至于他到底在干什么
<14-19,TOBIAS>But whatever he was working on,

376
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,140
<14-19,TOBIAS>你们在那儿应该能找到答案
<14-19,TOBIAS>you would probably find there.

377
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,610
<15-1,CASTLE>这故事太老套了
<15-1,CASTLE>It's an age-old story--

378
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,630
<15-1,CASTLE>一个顶级魔术师
<15-1,CASTLE>Magician at the top of his game,

379
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,190
<15-1,CASTLE>因其魔术设计师
<15-1,CASTLE>angry that his trick designer

380
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,950
<15-1,CASTLE>跳槽投入对手怀抱而怀恨在心
<15-1,CASTLE>has jumped ship for the competition,

381
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,250
<15-1,CASTLE>因此杀了他
<15-1,CASTLE>kills him instead of

382
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,530
<15-1,CASTLE>以防他泄漏秘密到敌人手里
<15-1,CASTLE>letting his trade secrets fall into enemy hands.

383
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,240
<15-2,BECKETT>这是魔术  卡塞尔  又不是冷战
<15-2,BECKETT>It's magic, Castle, not the Cold War.

384
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,030
<15-2,BECKETT>既然不是冷战
<15-2,BECKETT>Well, if it's not the Cold War,

385
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,600
<15-3,CASTLE>那扎尔曼要
<15-3,CASTLE>why does Zalman need

386
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,960
<15-3,CASTLE>-军用爆炸物品干嘛呢  -我怎么知道
<15-3,CASTLE>- military-grade explosives?  - I don't know. Hell.

387
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,820
<15-4,BECKETT>我们甚至不知道他是否真的是被谋杀的
<15-4,BECKETT>We don't even know if it really was murder.

388
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,570
<15-4,BECKETT>据我们所了解的来看  有可能还真是自杀
<15-4,BECKETT>For all we know, it could've actually been a suicide.

389
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,690
<15-6,CASTLE>-是蕾妮  -我猜猜  不是自杀
<15-6,CASTLE>- It's Lanie. Let me guess.  - It wasn't a suicide.

391
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,930
<16-1,LANIE>你们这速度都快赶上乌龟了
<16-1,LANIE>It took you two long enough.

392
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,920
<16-1,LANIE>到哪儿去了  欧洲吗
<16-1,LANIE>Where were you, Europe?

393
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,460
<16-2,BECKETT>-堵车  -孩子  干嘛不用警灯呢
<16-2,BECKETT>- Traffic.  - Girl, you could've used the gumball.

394
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,370
<16-3,LANIE>盛装打扮  而且很急切
<16-3,LANIE>Dressed to the nines, in a big hurry.

395
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,220
<16-4,CASTLE>说说  要去哪儿  那幸运的倒霉蛋是谁
<16-4,CASTLE>So... Where are you going and who's the lucky victim?

396
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,740
<16-5,LANIE>行啊  卡塞尔
<16-5,LANIE>I'll tell you what, Castle,

397
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,450
<16-5,LANIE>你先说说你和吉娜之间是怎么回事
<16-5,LANIE>you tell me what's going on between you and Gina,

398
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,140
<16-5,LANIE>我再告诉你我要去哪儿
<16-5,LANIE>and I'll tell you where I'm going tonight.

399
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,710
<16-6,BECKETT>你们在说什么呢
<16-6,BECKETT>What are you talking about?

400
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,020
<16-7,LANIE>他和女友在餐厅大吵了一架
<16-7,LANIE>He and his girlfriend had a big fight at le cirque.

401
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,890
<16-7,LANIE>都上报了
<16-7,LANIE>It was in the paper.

402
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,260
<16-8,CASTLE>请说说那个被害者好吗
<16-8,CASTLE>Can we talk about the victim, please?

403
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,240
<16-8,CASTLE>好吧
<16-8,CASTLE>Okay.

404
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,170
<16-9,LANIE>肺部没有积水
<16-9,LANIE>No water in the lungs.

405
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,400
<16-10,BECKETT>他不是淹死的
<16-10,BECKETT>He wasn't drowned?

406
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,680
<16-11,LANIE>不是  是窒息而死的
<16-11,LANIE>Nope, but he was asphyxiated,

407
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,120
<16-11,LANIE>这两者有时症状很相似
<16-11,LANIE>which sometimes presents the same way.

408
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,560
<16-12,BECKETT>有瘀伤
<16-12,BECKETT>Bruising.

409
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,390
<16-13,LANIE>像是有人用手压着他的鼻子和嘴
<16-13,LANIE>Like someone held their hand over his nose and mouth.

410
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,540
<16-13,LANIE>在被放入水箱前他就被杀死了
<16-13,LANIE>He was murdered before he was put into the tank.

411
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,220
<16-14,CASTLE>然后凶手拿了一张
<16-14,CASTLE>And then his killer took what he thought

412
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,510
<16-14,CASTLE>他以为是空白的纸  打了自杀说明
<16-14,CASTLE>was a blank piece of paper and typed out the suicide note.

413
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,950
<16-15,BECKETT>但为什么要用这种方法呢
<16-15,BECKETT>But why kill him that way?

414
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,600
<16-15,BECKETT>我是说  为什么要弄的像自杀一样
<16-15,BECKETT>I mean, why make it look like a suicide?

415
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,960
<16-16,CASTLE>掩饰凶手
<16-16,CASTLE>Cover up the murder.

416
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,310
<16-17,BECKETT>是凶手呢  还是涉及爆炸物的
<16-17,BECKETT>The murder, or something bigger

417
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,300
<16-17,BECKETT>更大的阴谋
<16-17,BECKETT>involving explosives?

418
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,830
<16-17,BECKETT>我们必须找到那个工作室
<16-17,BECKETT>We gotta find that workshop.

419
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,190
<17-1,CASTLE>你们俩还真是文明夜生活的楷模啊
<17-1,CASTLE>You are the picture of a civilized evening at home.

420
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,090
<17-2,MARTHA>而你就是个山顶洞人
<17-2,MARTHA>And you are a caveman.

421
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,560
<17-2,MARTHA>亲爱的  我们可是你的家人
<17-2,MARTHA>Darling, we are your family.

422
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,580
<17-2,MARTHA>你怎么不告诉我们这件事呢
<17-2,MARTHA>Why didn't you tell us about this?

423
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,330
<17-2,MARTHA>你有和她联系过吗  自那次公众事件以来
<17-2,MARTHA>Have you spoken to her, you know, since your P.D.A.?

424
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,200
<17-4,MARTHA>-那次  -当众泄愤
<17-4,MARTHA>- My--  - Public display of anger.

425
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,900
<17-5,ALEXIS>上面说你们在吵架  爸爸  吵什么
<17-5,ALEXIS>It says you were fighting, dad. What about?

426
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,880
<17-6,CASTLE>-好吧  你们一定要知道的话  -没错
<17-6,CASTLE>- Well, if you must know...  - Yes.

427
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,270
<17-7,MARTHA>我们在争吵这么多年我们到底吵了多少架
<17-7,MARTHA>We were fighting about how much we've been fighting.

428
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,060
<17-8,CASTLE>不介意的话  我真的想
<17-8,CASTLE>If you don't mind, I'd really like

429
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,330
<17-8,CASTLE>换个话题
<17-8,CASTLE>to change the subject.

430
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,430
<17-9,ALEXIS>把我当6岁小孩呢
<17-9,ALEXIS>What am I, 6?

431
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,760
<17-9,ALEXIS>至少也变出个20美元啊
<17-9,ALEXIS>At least pull out a $20.

432
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,030
<18-2,BECKETT>-嘿  我在想  -快  卡塞尔  跟上
<18-2,BECKETT>- Hey, I was thinking--  - Come on, Castle. Keep up.

433
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,690
<18-3,CASTLE>-这是要去哪儿  -扎尔曼的工作室
<18-3,CASTLE>- Where are we going?  - Zalman's workshop.

434
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,220
<18-5,CASTLE>你找到啦  怎么找到的
<18-5,CASTLE>You found it? How?

435
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,090
<18-6,BECKETT>在他浸水的钱包里有张浸水的地铁卡
<18-6,BECKETT>In his soggy wallet was a soggy metrocard.

436
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,480
<18-6,BECKETT>莱恩查了自动收费数据库
<18-6,BECKETT>Ryan ran it through the automated fare database.

437
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,690
<18-6,BECKETT>他往来于魔术用品店附近的地铁站
<18-6,BECKETT>He was traveling from a subway stop near his magic shop

438
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,510
<18-6,BECKETT>和布朗克斯区的终点站之间
<18-6,BECKETT>to the last stop out in the Bronx.

439
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,720
<18-7,CASTLE>所以我们要去那周围调查
<18-7,CASTLE>So we're canvassing the neighborhood.

440
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,880
<18-7,CASTLE>-要穿防弹衣吗  -不  不用
<18-7,CASTLE>- Do we need vests?  - No, no vests.

441
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,700
<18-8,BECKETT>记得两星期前的停电事件吗
<18-8,BECKETT>Remember that power outage a couple of weeks ago,

442
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,760
<18-8,BECKETT>-地铁也停了  -记得
<18-8,BECKETT>- shut down the subway? - Yes.

443
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,720
<18-10,BECKETT>我查了下扎尔曼的财务报表
<18-10,BECKETT>Well, I looked into Zalman's financials.

444
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,250
<18-10,BECKETT>那天他用信用卡雇了辆车
<18-10,BECKETT>He hired a town car that day with his credit card,

445
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,170
<18-10,BECKETT>我们已经把地址搞到手了
<18-10,BECKETT>and we now have his address.

446
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,020
<19-1,CASTLE>你确定是这里吗
<19-1,CASTLE>You sure this is the place?

447
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,710
<19-2,BECKETT>他是在这儿下车的
<19-2,BECKETT>This is where they dropped him off.

448
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,030
<19-3,CASTLE>这里像是块荒地  被围起来了
<19-3,CASTLE>Well, it looks abandoned, bricked up.

449
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,470
<19-4,BECKETT>快看  快看
<19-4,BECKETT>Look, look, look.

450
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,480
<19-4,BECKETT>有脚印
<19-4,BECKETT>Footprints.

451
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,400
<19-5,CASTLE>看到了  然后就凭空消失了
<19-5,CASTLE>Yes, to nowhere.

452
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,880
<19-6,BECKETT>这正是他留给我们的难题
<19-6,BECKETT>That's what he wanted us to think.

453
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,000
<19-7,BECKETT>芝麻开门
<19-7,BECKETT>Open sesame.

454
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,550
<19-8,CASTLE>扎尔曼的世外桃源
<19-8,CASTLE>Zalman's fortress of solitude.

455
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,210
<19-8,CASTLE>哇  卡塞尔
<19-8,CASTLE>Wow, Castle.

456
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,610
<19-9,BECKETT>这地方真对我祖父的胃口
<19-9,BECKETT>My grandfather would've loved this place.

457
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,580
<19-9,BECKETT>瞧  他居然有断头台
<19-9,BECKETT>Look, he has a guillotine.

458
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,040
<19-9,BECKETT>还有铁娘子
<19-9,BECKETT>And an iron maiden.

459
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,090
<19-9,BECKETT>甚至有百折箱
<19-9,BECKETT>He even had a zig zag box.

460
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,550
<19-9,BECKETT>知道吗  你和我祖父应该挺投缘
<19-9,BECKETT>You know, you would've liked my grandfather.

461
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,130
<19-9,BECKETT>或者说  你让我想起他了
<19-9,BECKETT>In fact, you remind me of him a little.

462
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,510
<19-10,CASTLE>荣幸之至
<19-10,CASTLE>I'm flattered.

463
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,630
<19-12,CASTLE>轮椅的压痕
<19-12,CASTLE>Wheelchair tracks?

464
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,930
<19-13,BECKETT>没错  看上去是最近的
<19-13,BECKETT>Yeah, and they look fairly fresh.

465
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,830
<19-14,CASTLE>也许他有访客前来
<19-14,CASTLE>Maybe he had a visitor.

466
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,740
<19-14,CASTLE>说得对
<19-14,CASTLE>Yeah.

467
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,990
<19-15,BECKETT>都是新弄上的
<19-15,BECKETT>They look recent.

468
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,640
<19-16,CASTLE>这些纸上的日期正是他被害的那天
<19-16,CASTLE>These papers are dated the day he was killed.

469
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,970
<19-17,BECKETT>我得让鉴证组彻查一下这里
<19-17,BECKETT>I'm gonna have to get C.S.U. to sweep this whole place.

470
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,320
<19-18,CASTLE>这是意外  还是某种艺术
<19-18,CASTLE>Is this an accident or art?

471
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,900
<19-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔  来看这个
<19-19,BECKETT>Castle, take a look at this.

472
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,150
<19-19,BECKETT>有几页被撕掉了
<19-19,BECKETT>The pages are ripped,

473
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,160
<19-19,BECKETT>看来他不想
<19-19,BECKETT>Like he didn't want anyone

474
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,770
<19-19,BECKETT>别人知道他在干嘛
<19-19,BECKETT>to know what he was working on.

475
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,830
<19-20,BECKETT>扎尔曼
<19-20,BECKETT>Zalman?

476
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,750
<19-21,ZALMAN LOOKALIKE>你们又是谁
<19-21,ZALMAN LOOKALIKE>Who the hell are you?

477
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,950
<19-22,CASTLE>史上最佳魔术
<19-22,CASTLE>Best trick ever.

478
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,650
<20-1,BECKETT>纽约警察  把手放在我能看到的地方
<20-1,BECKETT>NYPD. Keep your hands where I can see them.

479
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,630
<20-2,ZALMAN LOOKALIKE>怎么回事  你们在这儿干吗
<20-2,ZALMAN LOOKALIKE>What--what's going on? What are you doing here?

480
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,230
<20-3,CASTLE>扎尔曼
<20-3,CASTLE>Zalman?

481
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,820
<20-4,ZALMAN LOOKALIKE>我是埃德蒙  埃德蒙·德雷克
<20-4,ZALMAN LOOKALIKE>Edmund. Edmund Drake.

482
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,860
<20-5,BECKETT>你是他在波基普西的哥哥
<20-5,BECKETT>His brother from Poughkeepsie?

483
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,560
<20-6,CASTLE>-你们是双胞胎  -对
<20-6,CASTLE>- You're a twin. - Yeah.

484
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,200
<20-7,EDMUND>-我手能放下来了吗  -可以
<20-7,EDMUND>- Can I put my hands down? - Uh, yeah.

485
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,050
<20-9,CASTLE>你怎么藏在铁娘子里
<20-9,CASTLE>Why were you hiding in the iron maiden?

486
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,100
<20-10,EDMUND>这是隔壁的入口
<20-10,EDMUND>It's the entrance from the other room.

487
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,710
<20-11,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  我们为你弟弟而来
<20-11,BECKETT>I'm detective Beckett. We're here about your brother.

488
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,490
<20-12,EDMUND>我也是  他在哪儿
<20-12,EDMUND>So am I. Where is he?

489
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,680
<20-13,BECKETT>你还不知道
<20-13,BECKETT>You don't know?

490
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,690
<20-14,BECKETT>德雷克先生  很遗憾地通知你
<20-14,BECKETT>Mr. Drake, I'm sorry to tell you,

491
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,420
<20-14,BECKETT>你的弟弟已经去世了
<20-14,BECKETT>but your brother is dead.

492
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,880
<21-1,CASTLE>不是开玩笑吧
<21-1,CASTLE>Are you kidding me?

493
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,130
<21-1,CASTLE>他有个和他一模一样的四眼孪生兄弟
<21-1,CASTLE>He has an identical twin who wears glasses.

494
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,600
<21-1,CASTLE>这是继克拉克·肯特后最糟的伪装
<21-1,CASTLE>That's the worst disguise since Clark Kent,

495
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,300
<21-1,CASTLE>你居然相信他
<21-1,CASTLE>and you believe him?

496
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,480
<21-2,BECKETT>我没理由不信他  你看他完全不知所措
<21-2,BECKETT>I have no reason not to. Look at him. He's devastated.

497
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,210
<21-3,CASTLE>都是演戏  难道你从来不看电影吗
<21-3,CASTLE>It's an act. Don't you ever go to movies?

498
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,500
<21-3,CASTLE>这...
<21-3,CASTLE>It's...

499
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,000
<21-3,CASTLE>很可能死者其实是埃德蒙
<21-3,CASTLE>It's probably Edmund who's dead,

500
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,380
<21-3,CASTLE>而隔壁那个傻帽才是扎尔曼
<21-3,CASTLE>And that dweeb in the next room is Zalman.

501
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,510
<21-3,CASTLE>我敢打赌他杀害他哥哥  想过上哥哥的生活
<21-3,CASTLE>I bet he killed his brother to take over his life.

502
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,500
<21-4,BECKETT>到波基浦西去做会计吗
<21-4,BECKETT>As an accountant in Poughkeepsie?

503
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,240
<21-5,CASTLE>呃...这个...
<21-5,CASTLE>Well, I...

504
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,380
<22-1,EDMUND>几天前他打电话给我
<22-1,EDMUND>I knew something was wrong

505
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,470
<22-1,EDMUND>我就知道出问题了
<22-1,EDMUND>when he called me a couple of days ago.

506
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,970
<22-2,BECKETT>他找你做什么
<22-2,BECKETT>What did he call about?

507
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,800
<22-2,BECKETT>钱
<22-2,BECKETT>Money.

508
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,210
<22-3,EDMUND>他说有人给了他五十万美金
<22-3,EDMUND>He said someone was paying him a half a million dollars,

509
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,470
<22-3,EDMUND>-想让我帮他藏匿  -为什么要藏
<22-3,EDMUND>- and he needed my help to hide it. - Hide it how?

510
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,040
<22-5,EDMUND>确保政府无法查出
<22-5,EDMUND>To make sure that the government never found out

511
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,320
<22-5,EDMUND>这笔钱的来源
<22-5,EDMUND>where it came from.

512
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,850
<22-5,EDMUND>他当时的口气让我感到
<22-5,EDMUND>The way he was talking, it sounded like

513
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,990
<22-5,EDMUND>他可能扯进什么违法的勾当了
<22-5,EDMUND>he'd gotten involved in something illegal.

514
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,380
<22-6,CASTLE>那你在他仓库里做什么
<22-6,CASTLE>And what were you doing at his warehouse?

515
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,390
<22-7,EDMUND>我昨天突然觉得
<22-7,EDMUND>Well, I just had this feeling yesterday

516
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,040
<22-7,EDMUND>有事情不对头
<22-7,EDMUND>that something was terribly wrong,

517
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,640
<22-7,EDMUND>我试图联系他  但是联系不上
<22-7,EDMUND>and when I tried to reach him, I couldn't.

518
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,380
<22-7,EDMUND>所以就开车来这儿  这是双胞胎的心灵感应
<22-7,EDMUND>I drove down to the city. I think it was the twin thing.

519
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,070
<22-7,EDMUND>我们长这么大  常常有这种情况出现
<22-7,EDMUND>You know, all our lives, we've had this connection.

520
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,280
<22-8,CASTLE>当然了  双胞胎的心灵感应
<22-8,CASTLE>Yeah, of course. The twin thing.

521
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,320
<22-8,CASTLE>德雷克先生  跟我说说
<22-8,CASTLE>Tell me, Mr. Drake,

522
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,130
<22-8,CASTLE>凭你的家学渊源
<22-8,CASTLE>given your legacy,

523
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,060
<22-8,CASTLE>为什么你没和他一起继承家业呢
<22-8,CASTLE>why didn't you ever get into the family business, too?

524
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,480
<22-9,EDMUND>我没那个激情  当然  也没那本事
<22-9,EDMUND>No, I didn't have the passion... or the skill.

525
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,470
<22-9,EDMUND>扎尔曼和我
<22-9,EDMUND>Zalman and I, we, uh,

526
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,210
<22-9,EDMUND>我们以前倒是同台演出过
<22-9,EDMUND>we did have an act together as kids.

527
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,490
<22-10,EDMUND>他从台上消失
<22-10,EDMUND>He would disappear up on stage,

528
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,740
<22-10,EDMUND>我从观众身后消失
<22-10,EDMUND>And then--then I would appear in the back of the audience.

529
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,950
<22-10,EDMUND>也许这种把戏
<22-10,EDMUND>I guess it was only amazing

530
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,520
<22-10,EDMUND>只能让不知道我们是双胞胎的人叫好
<22-10,EDMUND>to people who didn't know we were twins.

531
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,740
<22-11,CASTLE>你太谦虚了
<22-11,CASTLE>Well, you're being modest.

532
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,840
<22-11,CASTLE>我确信你们骗过了不少人
<22-11,CASTLE>I'm sure you fooled a lot of people.

533
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,120
<22-12,BECKETT>德雷克先生  刚才你说你弟弟牵扯某事
<22-12,BECKETT>Mr. Drake, the activities that your brother was involved in,

534
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,380
<22-12,BECKETT>如果让你看看他的东西
<22-12,BECKETT>if you looked through his things, do you think

535
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,740
<22-12,BECKETT>不知道你能不能猜出他在做什么
<22-12,BECKETT>that you would be able to determine what he was doing?

536
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,130
<22-13,EDMUND>扎尔曼是非常有才华的工程师
<22-13,EDMUND>Zalman was a brilliant engineer,

537
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,010
<22-13,EDMUND>凭我的脑子恐怕无法参透他的想法
<22-13,EDMUND>And, uh, I'm afraid my brain just doesn't work that way.

538
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,850
<22-13,EDMUND>他是个很特别的人  你懂么
<22-13,EDMUND>He was someone special, you know?

539
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,470
<22-13,EDMUND>家族之光
<22-13,EDMUND>Light up a room.

540
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,300
<22-13,EDMUND>探长  我不知道他到底在做什么
<22-13,EDMUND>Look, Detective, I don't know what he got mixed up in.

541
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,450
<22-13,EDMUND>但我确信他罪不至死
<22-13,EDMUND>But I just know, he didn't deserve to die.

542
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,490
<23-1,CASTLE>我简直不敢相信你就这样让他走了
<23-1,CASTLE>I can't believe you're letting him just walk out of here.

543
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,480
<23-1,CASTLE>-要在电影里...  -这才不是电影
<23-1,CASTLE>- If this was a movie... - It's not a movie,

544
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,840
<23-2,BECKETT>再说我以什么罪名起诉他
<23-2,BECKETT>and what am I supposed to charge him with,

545
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
<23-2,BECKETT>就因为他是双胞胎吗
<23-2,BECKETT>Being a twin?

546
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,420
<23-3,CASTLE>涉嫌一宗魔术谋杀案的恶魔双胞胎哥哥
<23-3,CASTLE>Being an evil twin in a magic murder.

547
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,760
<23-4,BECKETT>帮他弟弟藏匿五十万
<23-4,BECKETT>A half-a-million-dollar payment that he's hiding

548
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,830
<23-4,BECKETT>躲避政府监督  用以购买塑胶炸药
<23-4,BECKETT>from the government, bricks of C4?

549
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,250
<23-4,BECKETT>我可不觉得这是魔术
<23-4,BECKETT>That doesn't sound like magic to me.

551
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,480
<23-6,ESPOSITO>鉴证组刚刚完成初步检查
<23-6,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. is just finishing their initial sweep.

552
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,110
<23-6,ESPOSITO>目前还没有任何迹象
<23-6,ESPOSITO>So far we haven't been able to find anything

553
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,240
<23-6,ESPOSITO>表明除了图比斯·斯瑞奇
<23-6,ESPOSITO>to indicate who Zalman might have been working for

554
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,110
<23-6,ESPOSITO>扎尔曼还给谁卖命
<23-6,ESPOSITO>other than Tobias Strange,

555
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,540
<23-6,ESPOSITO>但鉴证组在工作台上发现了
<23-6,ESPOSITO>but C.S.U. did find some trace residue of C4 explosives

556
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,630
<23-6,ESPOSITO>炸药残余物
<23-6,ESPOSITO>on the workbench.

557
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,100
<23-7,BECKETT>地上的压痕呢
<23-7,BECKETT>And what about the tracks?

558
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,310
<23-8,ESPOSITO>你判断得没错  的确是轮椅造成的
<23-8,ESPOSITO>You were right. They are from a wheelchair.

559
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,880
<23-8,ESPOSITO>这种压痕特征明显
<23-8,ESPOSITO>The tracks are pretty distinctive.

560
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,860
<23-8,ESPOSITO>我们正在取样制成模型
<23-8,ESPOSITO>We're running down make and model now.

561
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,520
<23-9,BECKETT>幸运的话
<23-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, with any luck,

562
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,190
<23-9,BECKETT>扎尔曼这位客户"神秘教授"即将现身
<23-9,BECKETT>professor x will turn out to be Zalman's mystery client.

563
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,460
<23-10,ESPOSITO>明白  谢谢
<23-10,ESPOSITO>Right. Thanks.

564
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,900
<23-11,CASTLE>这个说法如何  扎尔曼一时头脑发热
<23-11,CASTLE>What about this? Zalman gets in over his head,

565
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,290
<23-11,CASTLE>把他哥哥引到这里
<23-11,CASTLE>He lures his brother down here,

566
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,740
<23-11,CASTLE>闷死了他  把他放到水箱里
<23-11,CASTLE>suffocates him, sticks him in a tank

567
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,310
<23-11,CASTLE>造成他自己死亡的假象
<23-11,CASTLE>so it looks like he's dead.

568
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,470
<23-11,CASTLE>然后扎尔曼扮成
<23-11,CASTLE>Meanwhile, Zalman, as Edmund,

569
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,840
<23-11,CASTLE>埃德蒙继承魔术店
<23-11,CASTLE>inherits his own magic shop

570
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,330
<23-11,CASTLE>收取保险金  与此同时
<23-11,CASTLE>collects his own insurance, all the while

571
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,340
<23-11,CASTLE>还能将深爱埃德蒙的妻儿
<23-11,CASTLE>takes edmund's wife and children,

572
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,240
<23-11,CASTLE>据为己有
<23-11,CASTLE>Who love him, as his own.

573
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,010
<23-11,CASTLE>这不就是"以假乱真"吗
<23-11,CASTLE>It's "dead ringer."

574
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,880
<23-12,BECKETT>原来你还在讲话啊
<23-12,BECKETT>Are you still talking?

575
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,370
<23-13,CASTLE>埃德蒙即是扎尔曼
<23-13,CASTLE>Edmund is Zalman.

576
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,890
<24-1,LANIE>绝对不可能
<24-1,LANIE>Couldn't be more wrong.

577
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,850
<24-1,LANIE>我检查了被害人的指纹  确实是扎尔曼
<24-1,LANIE>I ran the prints on our victim. He is Zalman.

578
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,250
<24-3,CASTLE>-满意了吧  卡塞尔  -不如说我很失望
<24-3,CASTLE>- Satisfied, Castle? - More like disappointed.

579
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,530
<24-4,LANIE>或许这能让你高兴点儿
<24-4,LANIE>Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

580
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,670
<24-5,CASTLE>老人的白发
<24-5,CASTLE>Old man hair.

581
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,850
<24-6,LANIE>不  是白色兔毛
<24-6,LANIE>White rabbit fur.

582
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,570
<24-6,LANIE>从他的牙齿喉咙里发现的
<24-6,LANIE>It came from his teeth and throat.

583
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,730
<24-7,CASTLE>一只誓死不肯
<24-7,CASTLE>So he was killed by a rabbit

584
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,810
<24-7,CASTLE>从魔术帽里出来的兔子杀害了他
<24-7,CASTLE>who did not want to be pulled out of a hat.

585
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,330
<24-8,LANIE>你的猜测不比我差嘛
<24-8,LANIE>Your guess is as good as mine.

586
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,900
<24-8,LANIE>在调查扎尔曼
<24-8,LANIE>In the process of trying to determine

587
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,340
<24-8,LANIE>窒息原因时
<24-8,LANIE>how Zalman was asphyxiated,

588
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,550
<24-8,LANIE>我还在他的
<24-8,LANIE>I also discovered the presence

589
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,000
<24-8,LANIE>鼻子和咽喉处
<24-8,LANIE>of a low dose of organophosphates

590
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,450
<24-8,LANIE>发现了少量的有机磷酸酯
<24-8,LANIE>in his nose and throat.

591
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,920
<24-9,BECKETT>有机磷酸酯
<24-9,BECKETT>Organophosphates?

592
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,670
<24-10,LANIE>它通常用作液压机液体  飞机引擎润滑油
<24-10,LANIE>It's found in hydraulic fluids, jet engine oil,

593
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,630
<24-11,CASTLE>-杀虫剂  神经毒剂  -神经毒剂
<24-11,CASTLE>- insecticides, nerve agents. - Nerve agents?

594
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,600
<24-12,BECKETT>加上之前发现的塑胶炸药
<24-12,BECKETT>Well, along with the C4,

595
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,340
<24-12,BECKETT>我们这位魔术师
<24-12,BECKETT>our magician's sounding

596
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,900
<24-12,BECKETT>更像是恐怖分子
<24-12,BECKETT>more like a terrorist.

597
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,770
<24-13,LANIE>但含量很低
<24-13,LANIE>The amount is too small

598
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,120
<24-13,LANIE>说明他并没有直接接触
<24-13,LANIE>to indicate that he had been working with them directly,

599
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,510
<24-13,LANIE>但最近肯定去过存放这些东西的地方
<24-13,LANIE>but he definitely was exposed to them recently.

600
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,260
<24-14,ESPOSITO>奥耶  亲爱的  我正好路过这里  就想

<24-18,ESPOSITO>只有一家公司为电动轮椅制作这种轮胎
<24-18,ESPOSITO>unique to one brand of tire made for electric wheelchairs.

610
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,830
<24-18,ESPOSITO>我们打给了六间出售该轮胎的商店
<24-18,ESPOSITO>We called the half a dozen specialty shops

611

629
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,610
<25-3,CASTLE>或者轮椅只是为了掩人耳目
<25-3,CASTLE>Maybe the wheelchair is an act.

630
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,050
<25-3,CASTLE>每个魔术秀  都有一个
<25-3,CASTLE>In every magic story, there's an unexpected twist

631
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,650
<25-3,CASTLE>出人意料的大转折
<25-3,CASTLE>where things aren't always what they seem.

632
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,260
<25-3,CASTLE>是这类表演必须出现的
<25-3,CASTLE>it's an obligation of the genre.

637
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,250
<26-1,MAGNUS>我听说他的逃脱术失败了
<26-1,MAGNUS>I hear it was a failed escape.

638
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,040
<26-2,BECKETT>-更像是一次成功的谋杀  -噢
<26-2,BECKETT>- More like a successful murder. - Oh?

639
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,180
<26-3,CASTLE>他被丢进箱子前已经窒息了
<26-3,CASTLE>He was asphyxiated before he was lowered into the tank.

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,060
<26-4,MAGUS>你是说他真的被谋杀了
<26-4,MAGUS>You mean he was really murdered?

641
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,090
<26-5,CASTLE>猜猜他遇害时谁的货车
<26-5,CASTLE>And guess whose van was spotted outside his shop

642
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,440
<26-5,CASTLE>正停泊在他店外
<26-5,CASTLE>right about when he died.

643
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,890
<26-6,MAGNUS>你能别碰那个吗
<26-6,MAGNUS>Would you just not touch that, please?

00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,980
<26-8,MAGNUS>扎尔曼是我的好友
<26-8,MAGNUS>Look, Zalman was my friend.

649
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,510
<26-8,MAGNUS>他并不替我工作
<26-8,MAGNUS>He didn't work for me.

650
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,000
<26-8,MAGNUS>我为他工作  为他设计的魔术
<26-8,MAGNUS>I worked for him, making specialty items

651
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,490
<26-8,MAGNUS>制作些特别道具

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,860
<26-8,MAGNUS>没有炸药
<26-8,MAGNUS>Nothing explosive.

653
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,700
<26-8,MAGNUS>只是  那样的东西

656
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,300
<26-10,MAGNUS>我看起来像是能把他搬进箱子里吗
<26-10,MAGNUS>Does it look like I could've lifted him into a tank?

657
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,400
<26-11,CASTLE>或许你装了一对假肢
<26-11,CASTLE>Well, maybe you borrowed a set of legs.

658
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,180
<26-11,CASTLE>-或者就是这些  -住手
<26-11,CASTLE>- Maybe these or someone else's. - Stop it.

659
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,380

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,680
<26-14,MAGNUS>他们想见他
<26-14,MAGNUS>They wanted to meet him.

<26-14,MAGNUS>Zalman... Asked me to drop him off.

668
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,640
<26-14,MAGNUS>接下来  他就死了
<26-14,MAGNUS>Next thing I hear, he's dead.

669
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,910
<26-14,MAGNUS>我不知道他是被谋杀的
<26-14,MAGNUS>I didn't know it was murder.

670
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,560
<26-15,BECKETT>你在为他做什么
<26-15,BECKETT>The job that you did for him, what was it?

671
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,900
<26-16,MAGNUS>他让我替他做一个机械手臂
<26-16,MAGNUS>Well, he wanted me to make him a mechanical arm.

672
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,870
<26-16,MAGNUS>用来远程触发一些开关
<26-16,MAGNUS>You know, something to trigger a switch remotely.

<26-17,CASTLE>理论上  它能触发些什么
<26-17,CASTLE>Theoretically, what could it trigger?

<26-18,MAGNUS>所有东西  开灯  敲铃
<26-18,MAGNUS>Well, anything-- turn on a light, ring a bell.

<26-21,BECKETT>About what?

678
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,700
<26-22,MAGNUS>他说这是他最伟大的魔术了
<26-22,MAGNUS>He said this was his greatest magic trick ever.

679
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,420
<26-22,MAGNUS>有人花大笔的钱
<26-22,MAGNUS>Said he was getting paid a fortune

680
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,350
<27-1,RYAN>聘请他来帮助逃脱谋杀罪名
<27-1,RYAN>to get away with murder.

681
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,000
<27-1,RYAN>你真的认为有人会聘请一个魔术师
<27-1,RYAN>You really think someone would hire a magician

682
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,460
<27-1,RYAN>帮自己逃脱谋杀吗
<27-1,RYAN>to help them get away with murder?

683
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,390
<27-2,BECKETT>这真的很聪明
<27-2,BECKETT>I mean, it's brilliant really.

684
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,870
<27-2,BECKETT>魔术师是误导的大师
<27-2,BECKETT>Magicians are masters at misdirection.

685
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,380
<27-2,BECKETT>如果他们能操控观众
<27-2,BECKETT>If they can manipulate audiences,

686
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,420
<27-2,BECKETT>他们就能控制目击者
<27-2,BECKETT>they can manipulate witnesses.

687
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,920
<27-2,BECKETT>他们甚至能让人们
<27-2,BECKETT>They could even make people testify

688
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,650
<27-2,BECKETT>为从没发生过的事作证
<27-2,BECKETT>to things that never happened.

689
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,310
<27-3,CASTLE>很难相信
<27-3,CASTLE>It's just so hard to believe

690
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,340
<27-3,CASTLE>这么尊敬魔术的人
<27-3,CASTLE>that a person with that much respect for magic

691
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,940
<27-3,CASTLE>会利用自己的才能去杀人
<27-3,CASTLE>would use his skills to kill.

692
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,790
<27-4,BECKETT>他需要保住他的店
<27-4,BECKETT>He needed to save his shop,

693
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,680
<27-4,BECKETT>而五十万美元的酬劳也太高了
<27-4,BECKETT>and a half-a-million-dollar payday was too good to be true.

694
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,830
<27-5,RYAN>确实太高  所以他没有拿到  而是丢了性命
<27-5,RYAN>And it was. Instead of a payday, he got whacked.

695
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,540
<27-6,BECKETT>雇他的人大概觉得
<27-6,BECKETT>Well, the people who hired him probably figured

696
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,830
<27-6,BECKETT>杀了他会比较安全
<27-6,BECKETT>it was safer to kill him than run the risk

697
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,560
<27-6,BECKETT>免得他会受到良心谴责供出他们
<27-6,BECKETT>of having an attack of conscience and rat them out.

698
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,240
<27-7,CASTLE>没有证据  我们怎么找到他们
<27-7,CASTLE>Okay, so without evidence, how are we gonna find 'em?

699
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
<27-8,BECKETT>先找出他们雇扎尔曼去杀的人是谁
<27-8,BECKETT>By finding out exactly who they hired Zalman to kill.

700
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,260
<27-8,BECKETT>我们知道他的把戏
<27-8,BECKETT>We know he was working on a trick

701
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,410
<27-8,BECKETT>用到了c4和远程触发装置
<27-8,BECKETT>involving c-4 and a remote triggering device.

702
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,430
<27-9,RYAN>他的目标是被炸弹杀死的
<27-9,RYAN>Well, whoever he killed went out with a bang.

703
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,950
<27-10,BECKETT>在最近几周  附近三州地区内
<27-10,BECKETT>There can't have been that many deaths

704
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,850
<27-10,BECKETT>因爆炸而死的人
<27-10,BECKETT>in the tristate area in the last couple of weeks

705
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,060
<27-10,BECKETT>肯定不会多到哪去
<27-10,BECKETT>where someone was killed by an explosion.

706
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,930
<27-10,BECKETT>烟酒枪管局和消防部门的进度怎么样
<27-10,BECKETT>Where are we with ATF and the fire department?

707
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,410
<27-11,RYAN>我们应该能在早上拿到报告
<27-11,RYAN>We're supposed to get their reports in the morning.

708
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,140
<27-12,BECKETT>好的  同时看看我们能查到什么
<27-12,BECKETT>Okay, meantime, let's see what we can dig up ourselves.

709
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,230
<28-1,CASTLE>你知道纽约每周发生多少
<28-1,CASTLE>You know how many explosions there are

710
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,960
<28-1,CASTLE>爆炸事件吗
<28-1,CASTLE>in New York city every week?

711
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,860
<28-1,CASTLE>蒸汽管道爆炸
<28-1,CASTLE>Steam pipe explodes.

712
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,260
<28-1,CASTLE>煤气炉爆炸
<28-1,CASTLE>Gas stove explodes.

713
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,600
<28-2,MARTHA>情侣间的不满爆发
<28-2,MARTHA>Unhappy couple explodes.

714
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,200
<28-2,MARTHA>你不是在餐厅跟那个谁大发脾气吗
<28-2,MARTHA>Well, didn't you explode in a rather ritzy restaurant

715
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,330
<28-2,MARTHA>跟
<28-2,MARTHA>With, uh...

716
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,070
<28-3,MARTHA>说曹操  曹操就到
<28-3,MARTHA>Aha. Speak of the devil.

717
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,540
<28-3,MARTHA>你不打算接电话吗
<28-3,MARTHA>You're not gonna answer that?

718
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,370
<28-5,MARTHA>-接什么  -噢  做的不错
<28-5,MARTHA>- Answer what? - Ooh. Well done.

719
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,180
<28-5,MARTHA>当然了  令你的电话消失
<28-5,MARTHA>Of course, making your phone disappear

720
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,740
<28-5,MARTHA>并不代表问题也消失了
<28-5,MARTHA>doesn't make your problem disappear.

721
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,710
<28-6,CASTLE>是啊
<28-6,CASTLE>No.

722
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,730
<28-7,MARTHA>嘿  孩子
<28-7,MARTHA>Hey, come on, kiddo.

723
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,610
<28-7,MARTHA>你们两个发生什么事了
<28-7,MARTHA>What's going on with you two, really?

724
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,740
<28-8,CASTLE>什么事也没有
<28-8,CASTLE>Nothing's going on.

725
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,560
<28-9,CASTLE>不  没事  所有事都很好
<28-9,CASTLE>No, nothing at all. Everything is fine.

726
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,820
<28-9,CASTLE>所有事都
<28-9,CASTLE>Everything is...

727
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,000
<28-9,CASTLE>很好
<28-9,CASTLE>Just fine.

728
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,680
<28-9,CASTLE>跟往常一样
<28-9,CASTLE>It's ordinary.

729
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,210
<28-9,CASTLE>问题是
<28-9,CASTLE>The problem is, I...

730
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,130
<28-9,CASTLE>我不想要一成不变
<28-9,CASTLE>I don't want ordinary.

731
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,700
<28-9,CASTLE>我想要
<28-9,CASTLE>I want--

732
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,720
<28-10,MARTHA>魔法
<28-10,MARTHA>Magic.

733
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,980
<28-11,CASTLE>对  你知道问题是
<28-11,CASTLE>Yeah. You know what the problem is,

734
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,060
<28-11,CASTLE>我们不再相爱了
<28-11,CASTLE>is we just aren't in love.

735
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,300
<28-11,CASTLE>我们都不想承认
<28-11,CASTLE>Neither one of us wants to admit...

736
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,600
<28-11,CASTLE>有机磷酸酯
<28-11,CASTLE>Organophosphates.

737
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,120
<28-12,CASTLE>那不是神经毒剂而是喷射机燃油
<28-12,CASTLE>It wasn't a nerve agent. It was jet oil.

738
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,870
<28-12,CASTLE>-扎尔曼当时在飞机场  -什么
<28-12,CASTLE>- Zalman was at an airport. - What? I--

739
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,850
<28-14,CASTLE>我得走了
<28-14,CASTLE>I gotta go.

740
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,960
<28-15,MARTHA>一眨眼就不见人影了
<28-15,MARTHA>Now you see him, now you don't.

741
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,180
<29-1,CASTLE>嘿  我知道扎尔曼要杀害的目标了
<29-1,CASTLE>Hey. I think I figured out who Zalman was paid to kill.

742
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,430
<29-2,BECKETT>亿万富翁慈善家克里斯琴·达尔
<29-2,BECKETT>Billionaire philanthropist Christian Dahl?

743
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,570
<29-3,CASTLE>你怎么也...
<29-3,CASTLE>How did you...

744
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,840
<29-4,BECKETT>有机磷酸酯  就是喷气机用油  由此联想到机场
<29-4,BECKETT>organophosphates, jet oil, airport.

745
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,100
<29-5,CASTLE>咱俩就像是一对双胞胎
<29-5,CASTLE>It's like we could be twins.

746
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,510
<29-5,CASTLE>心有灵犀
<29-5,CASTLE>Connection.

747
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,620
<29-6,BECKETT>纯属猜测
<29-6,BECKETT>Conjecture.

748
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,230
<29-6,BECKETT>目前我们只知道达尔
<29-6,BECKETT>All we know right now is that Dahl

749
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,010
<29-6,BECKETT>周六下午在泰特波罗机场起飞
<29-6,BECKETT>took off from Teterboro Saturday afternoon

750
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,510
<29-6,BECKETT>准备刷新自驾机横跨大西洋的飞行速度纪录
<29-6,BECKETT>intending to set a transatlantic speed record in his jet.

751
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,510
<29-7,RYAN>显然后来飞机出了问题
<29-7,RYAN>Apparently, something went wrong,

752
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,160
<29-7,RYAN>在半空中发生爆炸
<29-7,RYAN>and the plane broke up midair.

753
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,430
<29-7,RYAN>据长岛海峡一艘油轮上的目击者称
<29-7,RYAN>Witnesses out on an oil tanker out on long island sound

754
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,070
<29-7,RYAN>他们看到空中闪过白光  飞机冒出浓烟
<29-7,RYAN>claim to have seen a white flash and smoke in the sky.

755
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,640
<29-8,CASTLE>空中爆炸的罪魁祸首
<29-8,CASTLE>Well, a midair explosion

756
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,130
<29-8,CASTLE>也许就是扎尔曼从查克那
<29-8,CASTLE>would account for all the c4 that

757
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,920
<29-8,CASTLE>买来的全部C4炸药
<29-8,CASTLE>Zalman bought from Chuck.

758
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,020
<29-9,RYAN>还有马格纳斯的遥控引爆装置
<29-9,RYAN>And Magnus' remote triggering device.

759
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,370
<29-10,CASTLE>也许正是想取克里斯琴性命的人
<29-10,CASTLE>Well, whoever wanted Christian dead

760
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,840
<29-10,CASTLE>杀了扎尔曼以掩盖罪行
<29-10,CASTLE>probably killed Zalman to cover up the crime.

761
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,320
<29-11,BECKETT>但这一切全是我们凭空推测的
<29-11,BECKETT>Except all we have now is speculation.

762
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,820
<29-12,ESPOSITO>喂  我刚和美国联邦航空局通完电话
<29-12,ESPOSITO>Yo. I just got off with the F.A.A.

763
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,940
<29-12,ESPOSITO>他们把起飞的监控录像发过来了
<29-12,ESPOSITO>They're sending over footage of the takeoff.

764
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,950
<29-12,ESPOSITO>达尔准备刷新纪录
<29-12,ESPOSITO>亿万富翁将飞跃大西洋

765
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,130
<29-13,CASTLE>就是这  达尔登上了私人喷气机
<29-13,CASTLE>Okay, there's Dahl getting on his jet

766
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,550
<29-13,CASTLE>准备做横跨大西洋的飞行尝试
<29-13,CASTLE>for the transatlantic flight attempt.

767
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,450
<29-13,CASTLE>看来他正在为起飞作准备
<29-13,CASTLE>Looks like he's doing his preflight.

768
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,080
<29-13,CASTLE>看这里
<29-13,CASTLE>Look at that.

769
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,070
<29-14,BECKETT>车身图案跟扎尔曼作坊的墙身图案一致
<29-14,BECKETT>It matches the outline on the wall in Zalman's workshop.

770
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,760
<29-14,BECKETT>原来他是在墙上漆标
<29-14,BECKETT>He was painting a decal.

771
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,520
<29-15,CASTLE>放大那个司机
<29-15,CASTLE>Zoom in on that guy.

772
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
<29-16,BECKETT>是扎尔曼·德雷克
<29-16,BECKETT>It's Zalman Drake.

773
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,390
<29-17,RYAN>他打扮成餐饮服务商
<29-17,RYAN>He dressed like a caterer.

774
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,390
<29-18,ESPOSITO>也许他正是借此通过安检的
<29-18,ESPOSITO>Probably so he can get past security.

775
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,110
<29-18,ESPOSITO>他是去送东西的
<29-18,ESPOSITO>He delivered something.

776
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,670
<29-19,CASTLE>对啊  炸药和引爆装置嘛
<29-19,CASTLE>Yeah, explosives and a triggering device.

777
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,410
<29-19,CASTLE>这绝对是雇凶杀人
<29-19,CASTLE>This was a murder for hire.

778
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,130
<29-19,CASTLE>快进
<29-19,CASTLE>Skip ahead.

779
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,160
<29-19,CASTLE>定格
<29-19,CASTLE>And freeze it.

780
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,270
<29-20,BECKETT>他计划让克里斯琴·达尔的飞机
<29-20,BECKETT>He planned for Christian Dahl's plane

781
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,860
<29-20,BECKETT>在大西洋上空爆炸
<29-20,BECKETT>to break up over the atlantic.

782
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,010
<29-21,CASTLE>堪称完美的犯罪  找不到证据
<29-21,CASTLE>It's the perfect crime-- no evidence...

783
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,780
<29-22,RYAN>-尸体  -和凶手
<29-22,RYAN>- No body... - No killer.

784
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,410
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你太疯狂了  我从没试过像这样的...
<30-1,ESPOSITO>You are crazy. I've never even tried anything like--

785
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,420
<30-1,ESPOSITO>-行  好的  我也是  再见  -谁来的
<30-1,ESPOSITO>- Yeah. Okay. Yeah, me, too. Bye. - Who was that?

786
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,690
<30-3,ESPOSITO>海岸警卫队  我打去看看他们有否
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Coast guard. I was just seeing if they, uh,

787
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,530
<30-3,ESPOSITO>-找到飞机的数据记录器  -结果呢
<30-3,ESPOSITO>- found the plane's data recorder. - Hmm. Did they?

788
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,290
<30-5,ESPOSITO>什么结果
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Did they what?

789
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,210
<30-6,BECKETT>喂  两位  克里斯琴·达尔查得怎样了
<30-6,BECKETT>Hey, guys, where are you on Christian Dahl?

790
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,390
<30-7,RYAN>这个人太不可思议了
<30-7,RYAN>This guy was unbelievable.

791
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,870
<30-7,RYAN>他之所以成为亿万富翁是因为
<30-7,RYAN>He became a billionaire by always being exactly

792
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,630
<30-7,RYAN>他总能在最佳时机  恰到好处地投资
<30-7,RYAN>in the right place at exactly the right time to invest

793
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,720
<30-7,RYAN>任何一支即将升值的股票  产品和构思
<30-7,RYAN>in whatever stock, product or idea was just about to hit.

794
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,800
<30-8,BECKETT>那他有仇家
<30-8,BECKETT>Did he have any enemies,

795
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,030
<30-8,BECKETT>或威胁过他的人吗
<30-8,BECKETT>anyone that was threatening him?

796
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,700
<30-9,ESPOSITO>没有  我全问过了  人人都爱他
<30-9,ESPOSITO>No, all the people I talked to loved him.

797
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,390
<30-9,ESPOSITO>他的慈善捐款比奥普拉[美国名嘴]还多
<30-9,ESPOSITO>He gave away more money than Oprah,

798
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,740
<30-9,ESPOSITO>他还投资了一大笔钱研究玄学
<30-9,ESPOSITO>and he gave a lot of money to research into the occult.

799
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,940
<30-10,RYAN>他登上过珠穆朗玛峰
<30-10,RYAN>He climbed Everest,

800
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,940
<30-10,RYAN>乘坐过热气球飞越欧洲
<30-10,RYAN>he flew across Europe in a hot air balloon,

801
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,190
<30-10,RYAN>他还参加过伊迪塔罗德狗拉雪橇赛
<30-10,RYAN>he even drove a dog sled in the iditarod.

802
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,480
<30-11,BECKETT>既然他那么出类拔萃
<30-11,BECKETT>Well, with that much going for him,

803
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,850
<30-11,BECKETT>肯定有一堆仇家的啊
<30-11,BECKETT>he had to have had a couple of haters.

804
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:41,000
<30-12,RYAN>只有一个  她兼具动机和下手机会
<30-12,RYAN>Just one, and she had both motive and opportunity.

805
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,020
<30-13,BECKETT>内奥米·韦尔登
<30-13,BECKETT>Naomi Weldon?

806
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,760
<30-13,BECKETT>内奥米·韦尔登·达尔
<30-13,BECKETT>Naomi Weldon Dahl--

807
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,600
<30-14,RYAN>克里斯琴的妻子  以前是个时装模特
<30-14,RYAN>Christian's wife and a former fashion model.

808
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,030
<30-14,RYAN>显然一个月前
<30-14,RYAN>Apparently, a month ago,

809
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,840
<30-14,RYAN>克里斯琴识穿她有婚外情
<30-14,RYAN>Christian caught her having an affair,

810
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,540
<30-14,RYAN>根据他们的婚前协议  如果男方提出离婚
<30-14,RYAN>and according to their prenup, if he divorced her,

811
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,650
<30-14,RYAN>女方将一无所得
<30-14,RYAN>she wound up with nothing.

812
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,680
<30-15,BECKETT>但若是他死了  她就能继承所有家产
<30-15,BECKETT>And if he dies, she inherits billions.

813
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,340
<30-16,CASTLE>-这张照片是在哪里拍的  -你注意到了啊
<30-16,CASTLE>- Where was this photo taken? - Ah, you noticed.

814
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,040
<30-17,RYAN>六周前的达尔基金效益晚宴
<30-17,RYAN>The Dahl foundation benefit six weeks ago.

815
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,660
<30-18,CASTLE>而当晚的娱乐嘉宾是...
<30-18,CASTLE>And the entertainment for the evening was...

816
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,290
<30-19,BECKETT>扎尔曼·德雷克
<30-19,BECKETT>Zalman Drake.

817
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:08,980
<30-20,CASTLE>记得吗  杰罗姆说过
<30-20,CASTLE>You know, Jerome did say

818
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,600
<30-20,CASTLE>扎尔曼当晚曾表演过大变活人
<30-20,CASTLE>Zalman made someone disappear that night.

819
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,150
<30-21,BECKETT>内奥米看完他的魔术
<30-21,BECKETT>Naomi sees his performance

820
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,910
<30-21,BECKETT>心想扎尔曼或许能
<30-21,BECKETT>and wonders if Zalman can make

821
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,180
<30-21,BECKETT>让他丈夫永远消失
<30-21,BECKETT>her husband disappear forever.

822
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,730
<30-22,RYAN>反正即将坐拥亿万身家
<30-22,RYAN>And with billions on the line...

823
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,420
<30-23,ESPOSITO>区区五十万不过是九牛一毛
<30-23,ESPOSITO>Half a million's just chump change.

824
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,320
<31-1,NAOMI>当他们告诉我克里斯琴的飞机失事后
<31-1,NAOMI>When they told me that Christian's plane disappeared,

825
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,560
<31-1,NAOMI>我就是这样认为的
<31-1,NAOMI>that's exactly what I thought.

826
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,230
<31-2,BECKETT>认为你丈夫的死并非偶然吗
<31-2,BECKETT>That your husband's death was no accident?

827
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,670
<31-3,NAOMI>克里斯琴是个完美主义者  人也疑神疑鬼
<31-3,NAOMI>Christian was a perfectionist, and he was superstitious.

828
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,240
<31-3,NAOMI>他在娶我之前对我做了三次背景调查
<31-3,NAOMI>He did three background checks before he married me.

829
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,790
<31-4,BECKETT>你和你丈夫有一份
<31-4,BECKETT>You and your husband had

830
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,500
<31-4,BECKETT>无懈可击的婚前协议
<31-4,BECKETT>an airtight prenuptial agreement.

831
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,150
<31-5,NAOMI>这是两个知名人士结婚的标准程序
<31-5,NAOMI>Standard when two high-profile people marry.

832
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,640
<31-6,BECKETT>如果你提出离婚或有婚外情
<31-6,BECKETT>And if you left the marriage or had an affair,

833
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,050
<31-6,BECKETT>离婚后你将得不到
<31-6,BECKETT>you'd be leaving the marriage

834
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,450
<31-6,BECKETT>配偶赡养费或子女抚养费
<31-6,BECKETT>without spousal or child support.

835
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,930
<31-7,NAOMI>那就是协议条款
<31-7,NAOMI>Those were the terms.

836
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,220
<31-7,NAOMI>我有个人事业  能自食其力
<31-7,NAOMI>I have my own career. I can take care of myself.

837
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,860
<31-8,BECKETT>但你确实有外遇
<31-8,BECKETT>But you were having an affair.

838
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,370
<31-9,NAOMI>我有没有外遇不归你管
<31-9,NAOMI>Whether or not I had an affair is none of your affair.

839
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,680
<31-9,NAOMI>如果你是在暗示我谋杀了亲夫
<31-9,NAOMI>If you're implying that I murdered my husband

840
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,260
<31-9,NAOMI>和别人相宿相栖  那你就错了
<31-9,NAOMI>to be with someone else, you're mistaken.

841
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,610
<31-9,NAOMI>我才不会杀人
<31-9,NAOMI>I wouldn't kill anyone.

842
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,550
<31-10,CASTLE>哪怕能继承巨额遗产吗
<31-10,CASTLE>Not even to inherit a fortune?

843
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,380
<31-11,NAOMI>那我就真是自取其辱了
<31-11,NAOMI>Well, then the joke would be on me.

844
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,060
<31-11,NAOMI>根本就没有巨额遗产
<31-11,NAOMI>There is no fortune.

845
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,460
<31-11,NAOMI>克里斯琴的所有户口都被冻结了
<31-11,NAOMI>All of Christian's accounts have been frozen.

846
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,540
<31-12,BECKETT>你是指遗产正在认证中
<31-12,BECKETT>You mean you're in probate.

847
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,800
<31-13,NAOMI>-不是  是真的冻结了  -为什么呢
<31-13,NAOMI>- No, I mean frozen. - Why?

848
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,640
<31-14,BECKETT>这你得去问地方检察官办公室
<31-14,BECKETT>You'll have to ask the district attorney's office.

849
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,580
<31-15,NAOMI>天知道原因是什么  他们不肯告诉我
<31-15,NAOMI>God knows, they wouldn't tell me.

850
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,940
<31-15,NAOMI>刚才那是地方检察官
<31-15,NAOMI>That was the D.A.

851
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,660
<32-1,BECKETT>显然  在遇难当天
<32-1,BECKETT>Apparently, at the time of his death,

852
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,960
<32-1,BECKETT>我们的亿万富翁兼投资大师
<32-1,BECKETT>our billionaire investment guru

853
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,730
<32-1,BECKETT>正在接受证监会的调查
<32-1,BECKETT>was being investigated by the S.E.C.

854
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,390
<32-1,BECKETT>证监会认为他依靠
<32-1,BECKETT>They thought that he was making his money

855
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,150
<32-1,BECKETT>传统诈骗手段来赚钱
<32-1,BECKETT>the old-fashioned way, by stealing it.

856
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,120
<32-1,BECKETT>他那些惊人的股票全是伪造的
<32-1,BECKETT>All of his amazing stock returns were falsified.

857
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,010
<32-1,BECKETT>整件事根本就是一个庞氏骗局
<32-1,BECKETT>The whole thing was a ponzi scheme.

858
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,030
<32-1,BECKETT>原来他们早在几周前就
<32-1,BECKETT>As it turns out, they were a couple of weeks away from

859
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,230
<32-1,BECKETT>以巨额欺诈起诉克里斯琴·达尔
<32-1,BECKETT>indicting Christian Dahl for massive fraud.

860
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,690
<32-1,BECKETT>他将变得一无所有
<32-1,BECKETT>He was gonna lose everything

861
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,560
<32-1,BECKETT>并将在联邦监狱服刑50年
<32-1,BECKETT>and face 50 years in federal prison.

862
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,990
<32-2,CASTLE>如果我是他  我也会想人间蒸发
<32-2,CASTLE>If I were him, I'd want to disappear, too.

863
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,060
<32-3,BECKETT>而人间蒸发的最佳途径莫过于...
<32-3,BECKETT>And what better way to disappear...

864
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,340
<32-4,CASTLE>-雇一名魔术师  -全中
<32-4,CASTLE>- Than hire a magician? - Bingo.

865
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,400
<32-4,CASTLE>克里斯琴·达尔正在飞机上做航前检查
<32-4,CASTLE>Christian Dahl is on the plane doing his preflight check.

866
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,670
<33-1,CASTLE>扎尔曼离开飞机...
<33-1,CASTLE>Zalman leaves the plane...

867
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,680
<33-1,CASTLE>达尔沿跑道滑行并起飞
<33-1,CASTLE>Dahl taxis to the runway and takes off.

868
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,270
<33-2,BECKETT>他总得找个时机下机啊
<33-2,BECKETT>Well, he had to have gotten off at some point,

869
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,250
<33-2,BECKETT>不然就演变成自杀行动了
<33-2,BECKETT>Otherwise, it would've been a suicide mission,

870
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,160
<33-2,BECKETT>自杀可用不着魔术师
<33-2,BECKETT>and you don't need a magician for that.

871
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,180
<33-2,BECKETT>除非...
<33-2,BECKETT>Unless...

872
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,440
<33-3,CASTLE>机师并不是克里斯琴·达尔
<33-3,CASTLE>that isn't Christian Dahl.

873
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
<33-4,BECKETT>-看着像是他啊  -假人
<33-4,BECKETT>- It looks just like him. - Dummy.

874
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,390
<33-5,CASTLE>不是说你  是说驾驶座上的那个
<33-5,CASTLE>Not you. The--on-- in the cockpit.

875
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,520
<33-5,CASTLE>他们将真达尔调包成假达尔了
<33-5,CASTLE>They switched out real Dahl for dummy Dahl.

876
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,460
<33-5,CASTLE>马格纳斯做的并不是引爆装置
<33-5,CASTLE>Magnus didn't build a triggering device for an explosion.

877
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,580
<33-5,CASTLE>他做的假臂是用来做航前检查的
<33-5,CASTLE>The arm he built was for doing the preflight check.

878
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,640
<33-5,CASTLE>那飞机根本就是架自动驾驶飞机
<33-5,CASTLE>The whole thing's an automaton.

879
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,060
<33-5,CASTLE>这就是魔术的关键所在
<33-5,CASTLE>That's the magic trick.

880
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,800
<33-5,CASTLE>他让全世界以为克里斯琴·达尔
<33-5,CASTLE>He made it look to the world like Christian Dahl

881
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,440
<33-5,CASTLE>还在飞机上
<33-5,CASTLE>was still on the plane,

882
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
<33-5,CASTLE>就跟图比斯·斯瑞奇让人以为
<33-5,CASTLE>the same way Tobias Strange made it look

883
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,510
<33-5,CASTLE>他在万剑穿心那刻
<33-5,CASTLE>like he was still in the cabinet when

884
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,470
<33-5,CASTLE>人还在箱子里一样
<33-5,CASTLE>the swords went in.

885
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,440
<33-6,BECKETT>然后他利用餐车
<33-6,BECKETT>And then he used the catering box

886
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,650
<33-6,BECKETT>把假人运上飞机  把克里斯琴·达尔弄下机
<33-6,BECKETT>to get the dummy on board and Christian Dahl off.

887
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,510
<33-6,BECKETT>那驾驶飞机的人是谁
<33-6,BECKETT>Then who's piloting that plane?

888
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,580
<33-7,CASTLE>克里斯琴·达尔啊  只是并非在驾驶座上控制
<33-7,CASTLE>Christian Dahl, only not from the cockpit.

889
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,540
<33-7,CASTLE>他通过遥控器操纵飞机起飞  你看
<33-7,CASTLE>He had it rigged to fly via remote control. See?

890
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,970
<33-7,CASTLE>扎尔曼在把餐车搬进小货车
<33-7,CASTLE>Zalman puts the box in the van.

891
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,680
<33-7,CASTLE>里头可能有一部控制器
<33-7,CASTLE>There's probably a console inside there

892
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,020
<33-7,CASTLE>连着飞机的航空电子设备
<33-7,CASTLE>linked to the plane's avionics.

893
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,360
<33-7,CASTLE>达尔遥控飞机起飞
<33-7,CASTLE>Dahl takes off remotely...

894
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,680
<33-7,CASTLE>飞到大西洋上空
<33-7,CASTLE>flies out over the Atlantic...

895
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,030
<33-8,BECKETT>然后他引爆炸弹
<33-8,BECKETT>And then he detonates the explosion,

896
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,450
<33-8,BECKETT>所有人都以为他死了
<33-8,BECKETT>and everyone thinks that he's dead

897
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,180
<33-8,BECKETT>因为大家都看到他上了飞机
<33-8,BECKETT>because everyone's seen him on board.

898
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,300
<33-9,CASTLE>其实达尔还活得好好的
<33-9,CASTLE>Only Dahl is very much alive,

899
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,600
<33-9,CASTLE>而且世界上只有一个人知道他还活着
<33-9,CASTLE>and there's only one person in the world that knows it.

900
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,990
<33-10,BECKETT>那就是扎尔曼  只要他还活着  他对达尔来说就是个威胁
<33-10,BECKETT>Zalman, and as long as he's alive, he's a threat to Dahl.

901
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,990
<33-11,CASTLE>所以达尔得把这个问题解决掉
<33-11,CASTLE>So Dahl has to tie up that one loose end.

902
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,860
<33-12,BECKETT>但是他不能冒险让其他人知道他还活着
<33-12,BECKETT>But he can't risk anyone knowing that he's still alive.

903
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,230
<33-13,CASTLE>所以达尔必须亲手杀了扎尔曼
<33-13,CASTLE>So Dahl has to kill Zalman himself.

904
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,400
<33-14,BECKETT>怎么了
<33-14,BECKETT>What?

905
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,150
<33-15,CASTLE>没什么  那我们现在怎么办
<33-15,CASTLE>Nothing. So what do we do now?

906
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,660
<33-16,BECKETT>从事故发生到现在已经四天了
<33-16,BECKETT>Well, it's four days since the accident.

907
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,370
<33-16,BECKETT>克里斯琴·达尔没准已经
<33-16,BECKETT>Christian Dahl is probably

908
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:26,940
<33-16,BECKETT>带着一大笔钱
<33-16,BECKETT>in some non-extradition country

909
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,500
<33-16,BECKETT>跑到一个没有引渡条款的国家去了
<33-16,BECKETT>with a chunk of his fortune by now.

910
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,870
<33-17,CASTLE>没准
<33-17,CASTLE>Yeah, probably.

911
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,420
<33-18,BECKETT>除非
<33-18,BECKETT>Unless...

912
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,050
<33-18,BECKETT>除非什么
<33-18,BECKETT>Unless what?

913
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,550
<33-19,CASTLE>达尔做事喜欢大肆张扬
<33-19,CASTLE>Well, Dahl does everything publicly.

914
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,640
<33-19,CASTLE>这家伙喜欢受到万众瞩目  大家都以为他死了
<33-19,CASTLE>The guy loves being famous. Everyone thinks he's dead.

915
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,390
<33-19,CASTLE>对于这样一个人来说  不  这主意太疯狂了
<33-19,CASTLE>A guy like that... No, it's crazy.

916
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,280
<33-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们现在正需要点疯狂
<33-20,BECKETT>Castle, crazy is exactly what we need right now.

917
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,720
<34-1,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  这的确是很疯狂  -疯是疯了点  但是恰到好处
<34-1,BECKETT>- Castle, this is crazy.  - Crazy but in character.

918
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,640
<34-2,CASTLE>想想克里斯琴·达尔的做事风格
<34-2,CASTLE>Look at the kind of guy Christian Dahl was --

919
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,200
<34-2,CASTLE>他多喜欢成为万众瞩目的焦点
<34-2,CASTLE>how he loved the limelight,

920
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,150
<34-2,CASTLE>还有他对死后生活的着迷
<34-2,CASTLE>his fascination with life after death.

921
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,180
<34-2,CASTLE>你觉得这样一个人会错过
<34-2,CASTLE>You think a guy like that is gonna miss the opportunity

922
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,830
<34-2,CASTLE>参加自己葬礼的机会吗
<34-2,CASTLE>to attend his own funeral?

923
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,140
<34-4,CASTLE>-你会吗  -绝不可能
<34-4,CASTLE>- Would you?  - Not a chance.

924
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,690
<34-5,BECKETT>好吧  要是他在场的话  我们怎么找到他
<34-5,BECKETT>Okay, so if he's here, how do we find him?

925
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,270
<34-6,CASTLE>他肯定会做些伪装
<34-6,CASTLE>Well, he'll be in disguise, of course.

926
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,350
<34-6,CASTLE>找一些举止异常的人
<34-6,CASTLE>Look for an anomaly,

927
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,630
<34-6,CASTLE>某个想要融入这一切
<34-6,CASTLE>someone who's trying to fit in

928
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,650
<34-6,CASTLE>却始终还是格格不入的人
<34-6,CASTLE>yet sticking to the outskirts,

929
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,370
<34-6,CASTLE>某个不跟任何人交流
<34-6,CASTLE>someone who isn't engaging in conversation

930
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,750
<34-6,CASTLE>但与此同时
<34-6,CASTLE>but at the same time,

931
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,700
<34-6,CASTLE>却在一旁偷听别人讲话的人
<34-6,CASTLE>eavesdropping on other people's conversations.

932
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,530
<34-6,CASTLE>某个
<34-6,CASTLE>Someone who's --

933
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,370
<34-7,BECKETT>留着长头发  小胡子  还穿着一千美金一双的鞋吗
<34-7,BECKETT>Got long hair, a beard, and $1,000 shoes?

934
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,130
<34-8,CASTLE>这办法也行
<34-8,CASTLE>Yeah, that'll work, too.

935
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,740
<34-9,BECKETT>达尔先生
<34-9,BECKETT>Mr. Dahl.

936
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,710
<34-10,ESPOSITO>既然死了就一直装死嘛  兄弟
<34-10,ESPOSITO>You shoulda stayed dead, bro.

937
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,070
<35-1,DAHL>我是假造了自己的死亡
<35-1,DAHL>So I faked my own death.

938
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,770
<35-1,DAHL>那又怎样  这又不是犯罪
<35-1,DAHL>So what? That's not a crime.

939
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,890
<35-1,DAHL>你们要起诉我什么罪名
<35-1,DAHL>What are you gonna charge me with,

940
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,960
<35-1,DAHL>污染大西洋吗
<35-1,DAHL>littering the Atlantic?

941
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,890
<35-1,DAHL>我哪及英国石油公司污染的厉害呀
<35-1,DAHL>I'll stand in line behind BP.

942
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,420
<35-2,BECKETT>罪名是故意谋杀罪
<35-2,BECKETT>The charge is premeditated murder.

943
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,850
<35-3,CASTLE>我们看透了你的小把戏
<35-3,CASTLE>We figured out your little trick.

944
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,460
<35-3,CASTLE>扎尔曼在你的慈善晚会上演出
<35-3,CASTLE>Zalman performed for your charity event.

945
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,830
<35-3,CASTLE>他让你在舞台上消失  于是你灵机一动
<35-3,CASTLE>He made you disappear, giving you the inspiration

946
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,480
<35-3,CASTLE>想要借此来永久消失  你知道他缺钱
<35-3,CASTLE>to pull the ultimate escape. You knew he needed money,

947
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,430
<35-3,CASTLE>于是你就提出给他一大笔钱
<35-3,CASTLE>so you made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

948
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,220
<35-4,BECKETT>但是你根本没打算给他钱  对吧  达尔先生
<35-4,BECKETT>But you never planned on paying him, did you, Mr. Dahl?

949
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,290
<35-4,BECKETT>实际上  你计划利用
<35-4,BECKETT>No, you planned on using his desperation

950
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,360
<35-4,BECKETT>他害怕丢掉家族遗产的绝望
<35-4,BECKETT>over the loss of his family's legacy

951
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,450
<35-4,BECKETT>来使人以为他选择了自杀
<35-4,BECKETT>to make people think that he committed suicide.

952
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,450
<35-5,CASTLE>假造枪击太复杂了
<35-5,CASTLE>Staging a shooting, it's too cumbersome.

953
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,940
<35-5,CASTLE>会引发太多的问题  像是枪是哪来的
<35-5,CASTLE>Too many questions. Where'd the gun come from?

954
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,740
<35-5,CASTLE>所以你就用手头上的资源来除掉
<35-5,CASTLE>So you used what you had on hand to get rid of

955
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,350
<35-5,CASTLE>世界上唯一一个知道你还活着的人
<35-5,CASTLE>the only person on earth who knew you were still alive.

956
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,930
<35-5,CASTLE>一旦把他除掉  你就自由且永无后患了
<35-5,CASTLE>Once he was gone, you'd be free and clear.

957
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,250
<35-5,CASTLE>你们
<35-5,CASTLE>Is...

958
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,290
<35-6,DAHL>你们查案无门的时候就这样吗
<35-6,DAHL>is that what you do when you can't solve a crime,

959
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,280
<35-6,DAHL>胡编乱造
<35-6,DAHL>concoct fantasies?

960
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,500
<35-7,BECKETT>我们在死者身上找到了
<35-7,BECKETT>The rabbit hair that lined your gloves

961
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,430
<35-7,BECKETT>你手套内侧的兔毛
<35-7,BECKETT>was found on our victim.

962
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,010
<35-7,BECKETT>你打电话给扎尔曼  约他在他的店里见面
<35-7,BECKETT>You called Zalman, met him at his shop,

963
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,210
<35-7,BECKETT>你戴着手套捂住他的嘴
<35-7,BECKETT>put your gloved hand over his mouth,

964
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,290
<35-7,BECKETT>然后使他窒息而死
<35-7,BECKETT>and then you smothered him.

965
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,800
<35-8,DAHL>如果你以为我会怕你或是怕证券交易委员会的话
<35-8,DAHL>If you think I'm afraid of you or the SEC...

966
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,750
<35-8,DAHL>我一定会打得你们哭爹喊娘
<35-8,DAHL>I will beat your pants off

967
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,940
<35-8,DAHL>然后笑着看你们哭
<35-8,DAHL>and enjoy every minute of it...

968
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,640
<35-8,DAHL>当然了  前提是我保释出狱后你们还能找的到我
<35-8,DAHL>Assuming you can find me once I'm out on bail.

969
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,520
<35-9,BECKETT>你该害怕的不是我  达尔先生
<35-9,BECKETT>It's not me that you should be scared of, Mr. Dahl,

970
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,270
<35-9,BECKETT>也不是证券交易委员会
<35-9,BECKETT>or the SEC.

971
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,260
<35-9,BECKETT>你该怕的是你自己现在这个样子
<35-9,BECKETT>You should be afraid of what you've become.

972
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,810
<35-10,DAHL>要是你说教完了
<35-10,DAHL>Well, if you're done with your lecture

973
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,000
<35-10,DAHL>或是没东西好恐吓我了的话  我想见一下我的
<35-10,DAHL>or your petty threats, I'd like to see my...

974
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,710
<35-11,DAHL>我的律师
<35-11,DAHL>my lawyer.

975
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,280
<35-12,CASTLE>有什么不妥吗  达尔
<35-12,CASTLE>Something wrong, Dahl?

976
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,180
<35-13,DAHL>没什么
<35-13,DAHL>No.

977
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,440
<35-14,BECKETT>克里斯琴
<35-14,BECKETT>Christian?

978
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,600
<35-14,BECKETT>你
<35-14,BECKETT>H --

979
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,450
<35-15,DAHL>你是怎么做到的
<35-15,DAHL>How are you doing that?

980
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,320
<35-16,BECKETT>做到什么
<35-16,BECKETT>Doing what?

981
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,960
<35-17,CASTLE>-他见鬼了吗  -我不知道
<35-17,CASTLE>- Is he having flashbacks?  - I don't know.

982
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:42,900
<35-19,DAHL>你看到他了吗
<35-19,DAHL>Do you see him?

983
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,770
<35-20,BECKETT>谁
<35-20,BECKETT>Who?

984
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,080
<35-21,DAHL>他刚才就在这
<35-21,DAHL>He was right here.

985
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,930
<35-21,DAHL>天啊
<35-21,DAHL>Oh, god.

986
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,550
<35-21,DAHL>你不可能  你不可能在这的呀
<35-21,DAHL>You can't...you can't be here.

987
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,220
<35-21,DAHL>你死了
<35-21,DAHL>You're dead!

988
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,160
<35-22,DAHL>你已经死了  我
<35-22,DAHL>You're dead. I...

989
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,810
<35-22,DAHL>我杀了你
<35-22,DAHL>I killed you.

990
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,970
<35-22,DAHL>阿拉卡赞姆[咒语]  混蛋
<35-22,DAHL>Alakazam, jackass.

991
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,340
<36-1,CASTLE>你怎么知道这招可行
<36-1,CASTLE>How did you know that would work?

992
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,140
<36-2,BECKETT>我不知道  我只知道他肯定会叫律师
<36-2,BECKETT>I didn't. I just knew he'd lawyer up.

993
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,940
<36-2,BECKETT>所以我想  何不试试呢
<36-2,BECKETT>So I figured, why not take a shot?

994
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,290
<36-3,CASTLE>你祖父肯定会为你骄傲的
<36-3,CASTLE>Your grandfather would be proud.

995
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,760
<36-4,BECKETT>非常感谢  先生们
<36-4,BECKETT>Thank you so much, gentlemen.

996
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,530
<36-5,TOBIAS>能帮到纽约警局是我的荣幸
<36-5,TOBIAS>Always a pleasure to lend a hand to the NYPD.

997
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,900
<36-5,TOBIAS>我也许可以把这个加到我的节目单里
<36-5,TOBIAS>I might add this one to my repertoire

998
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,690
<36-5,TOBIAS>来纪念你的哥哥
<36-5,TOBIAS>in tribute to your brother.

999
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,060
<36-6,EDMUND>谢谢你探长  还有卡塞尔先生
<36-6,EDMUND>Thank you, detective, Mr. Castle.

1000
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,230
<36-7,CASTLE>那德雷克的魔术店怎么办
<36-7,CASTLE>So what's gonna happen to Drake's magic shop?

1001
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,830
<36-8,EDMUND>我跟图比斯刚刚正在讨论这个问题呢
<36-8,EDMUND>Hmm. Tobias and I were discussing that.

1002
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,750
<36-8,EDMUND>扎尔曼拼了命地保护它
<36-8,EDMUND>Zalman put his life on the line for it,

1003
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,810
<36-8,EDMUND>所以我们希望想个办法保住它
<36-8,EDMUND>so we'd like to find a way to keep it alive.

1004
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,450
<36-9,TOBIAS>也许我们集思广益  能找到解决办法呢
<36-9,TOBIAS>Maybe we can pull a solution out of our collective hats.

1005
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,740
<36-10,BECKETT>晚安
<36-10,BECKETT>Good night.

1006
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,620
<36-10,BECKETT>再见
<36-10,BECKETT>Bye.

1007
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,120
<36-11,RYAN>你能不能
<36-11,RYAN>Hey, could you, uh...

1008
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,030
<36-12,BECKETT>没问题
<36-12,BECKETT>Oh, yeah.

1009
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,010
<36-13,BECKETT>埃斯波西托去哪了
