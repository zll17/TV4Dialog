<1-13,MARTHA>我不是一直都在指导你的人生吗
<1-13,MARTHA>Haven't I been telling you what to do your whole life?

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,100
<1-14,ALEXIS>老爸  朱莉·施密特的爸爸又进戒毒所了
<1-14,ALEXIS>Oh, uh, dad, Julie Schmidt's father is back in rehab,

32

<1-17,CASTLE>我的保护欲只能留在家了  还记得
<1-17,CASTLE>My chaperoning needs reside here, or are you forgetting

39
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,500
<1-17,CASTLE>上次奶奶一个人在家发生了什么吗
<1-17,CASTLE>What happened the last time we left her alone?

40

<1-19,CASTLE>墙上到处都是石灰粉片
<1-19,CASTLE>There were lime shards embedded in the walls.

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,200
<1-22,CASTLE>我听到死亡的声音了
<1-22,CASTLE>I hear dead people.

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,000
<1-22,CASTLE>谁被谋杀了  吓人吗
<1-22,CASTLE>Who was murdered, and was it gruesome?

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
<2-1,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>这名受害人
<2-1,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>One victim-

47
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
<2-1,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>唐纳德·肯德尔  18岁
<2-1,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>Donald Kendall,18.

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
<2-1,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>雷丁预科高中的一名高三学生
<2-1,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>He was a senior at Redding Prep.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>他要错过毕业舞会了
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>Someone's gonna miss prom night.

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
<2-3,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>雷丁预科高中

<2-4,CASTLE>派克大街(纽约市豪华大街)的一所私立学校
<2-4,CASTLE>Private school on Park Avenue.

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
<2-5,ESPOSITO>有钱人的孩子上的学校
<2-5,ESPOSITO>No trust fund baby left behind.

53
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,500
<2-6,BECKETT>-他怎么会在船里  -不清楚
<2-6,BECKETT>- What's he doing in the boat? - No idea.

54
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,100
<2-8,BECKETT>-帕里什法医  怎么样  -有点怯场
<2-8,BECKETT>- Dr. Parish, how are you doing? - Feet are cold.

55
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,300
<2-9,DR LANIE PARISH>那有什么有用的信息吗
<2-9,DR LANIE PARISH>So what do you got for me?

56
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,400
<2-11,LANIE>胸部中了一枪   大口径手枪
<2-11,LANIE>Single G.S.W. to the chest, fairly large caliber.

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,100
<2-11,LANIE>船里血量很少
<2-11,LANIE>And from the lack of blood inside the boat,

58
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,000
<2-11,LANIE>所以他并不是在船上遇害
<2-11,LANIE>I'd say he wasn't killed at sea.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,850
<2-12,BECKETT>有人移动过他
<2-12,BECKETT>Somebody moved him.

60
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,700
<2-13,LANIE>他的鞋子上都是土和草
<2-13,LANIE>He's got dirt and grass all on his Chucky t's.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
<2-13,LANIE>并不像是亡灵之旅
<2-13,LANIE>Other than the postmortem voyage,

62
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
<2-13,LANIE>是被抛尸在这儿
<2-13,LANIE>Looks like a pop and drop.

63
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
<2-13,LANIE>死亡时间推算是昨天深夜
<2-13,LANIE>I'm guessing sometime late last night.

64
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
<2-14,BECKETT>有人把他拖到这儿的
<2-14,BECKETT>Well, somebody dragged him here.

65
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
<2-14,BECKETT>死亡地点不可能太远
<2-14,BECKETT>He couldn't have come from very far.

66
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,500
<2-14,BECKETT>让同事们在周围搜查看看
<2-14,BECKETT>Let's get uniforms down here to do a perimeter walk.

67
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,600
<2-14,BECKETT>从船一直第五大道
<2-14,BECKETT>Get 'em to go from the boats over there down to fifth.

68
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,300
<2-14,BECKETT>告诉他们要找的是大滩血迹
<2-14,BECKETT>And tell 'em they're looking for a blood pool

69
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,900
<2-15,RYAN>-可能还有子弹壳  -收到
<2-15,RYAN>- And possible shell casings.  - Roger that.

70
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,700
<2-16,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  查过船库了没
<2-16,BECKETT>Esposito, did you check the boathouse?

71
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,600
<2-17,ESPOSITO>还没
<2-17,ESPOSITO>Not yet.

72
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
<2-18,BECKETT>为什么要葬在船里
<2-18,BECKETT>So why the burial at sea?

73
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,000
<2-19,CASTLE>维京人相信  如果你想
<2-19,CASTLE>The Vikings believed that if you wanted

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,800
<2-19,CASTLE>死后进入英灵殿  就需要一艘船
<2-19,CASTLE>To reach Valhalla, you needed a vessel.

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,700
<2-20,BECKETT>持枪的维京人  又是你的故事
<2-20,BECKETT>Gun- toting Viking- that's your theory?

76
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,400
<3-2,MRS KENDALL>不  不是
<3-2,MRS KENDALL>No, no, no.

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
<2-21,CASTLE>他们还会要一个女人
<2-21,CASTLE>They also launched their dead with a sacrificial woman...

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,900
<2-21,CASTLE>美酒和一匹好马作为祭品
<2-21,CASTLE>And some booze and a good horse.

80
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,200
<3-1,BECKETT>你知道他在这个公园做什么吗
<3-1,BECKETT>Do you know what he would've been doing in the park?

81
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,400
<3-2,MRS KENDALL>不知道
<3-2,MRS KENDALL>No.

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
<3-3,BECKETT>你上次见到你儿子是什么时候
<3-3,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw your son alive?

<3-4,MRS KENDALL>昨天  他去上学的时候
<3-4,MRS KENDALL>Yesterday, uh, when he left for school.

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
<3-5,BECKETT>你知道他放学后可能会去哪儿吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Do you know maybe where he went after?

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
<3-6,MRS KENDALL>他通常和朋友们在一起
<3-6,MRS KENDALL>He was usually with his friends.

86
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,800
<3-7,BECKETT>他不回家吃晚饭吗
<3-7,BECKETT>He didn't come home for dinner?

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,300
<3-8,MRS KENDALL>大多数情况  唐尼在外面吃或在别人家吃
<3-8,MRS KENDALL>Most nights, Donny ate out or at someone else's place.

88
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,100
<3-9,MR KENDALL>他和雷丁高中那群好朋友在一起
<3-9,MR KENDALL>He hung out with a pretty tight crowd at Redding.

89

<3-9,MR KENDALL>他们从初中时就一起玩了
<3-9,MR KENDALL>They've all been together since grammar school.

90
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
<3-10,MRS KENDALL>唐尼原来也常带他们回家吃饭
<3-10,MRS KENDALL>Donny used to have them over all the time.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
<3-11,CASTLE>只是  你们最近搬家了
<3-11,CASTLE>Only, you’ve moved recently.

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
<3-12,MRS KENDALL>-是的  几个月前  -我是雷曼公司的股东
<3-12,MRS KENDALL>- Yes, a few months ago. - I was a partner at Lehman.

93
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,000
<3-13,MR KENDALL>雷曼破产  我们损失很大
<3-13,MR KENDALL>When it went under, well, we- we took a big hit.

94
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
<3-14,CASTLE>这对一个十几岁的孩子来说很难适应
<3-14,CASTLE>That can be pretty tough on a teenager.

95
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,100
<3-15,MRS KENDALL>已经习惯了某种生活方式
<3-15,MRS KENDALL>You get used to a certain way of living,

96
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,500
<3-15,MRS KENDALL>但这不是任何人的错
<3-15,MRS KENDALL>But it was no one's fault.

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
<3-16,CASTLE>你觉得唐尼有因此而消沉吗
<3-16,CASTLE>Do you think Donny was depressed?

98
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
<3-17,MR KENDALL>没有  唐尼很坚强
<3-17,MR KENDALL>No, Donny was strong.

99
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,200
<3-17,MR KENDALL>但失去你拥有的一切
<3-17,MR KENDALL>But to lose everything you have...

100
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,700
<3-17,MR KENDALL>我们只是还过得去而已
<3-17,MR KENDALL>We were just getting by.

101
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,900
<3-18,BECKETT>对于你们的情况  我很遗憾
<3-18,BECKETT>I'm very sorry for your loss.

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,700
<3-18,BECKETT>你怎么知道他们搬过家
<3-18,BECKETT>How did you know they moved?

103
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,500
<4-1,CASTLE>除非肯德尔夫妇是真的喜欢艺术
<4-1,CASTLE>Either the Kendalls really like art

104
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,150
<4-1,CASTLE>否则那个中国屏风
<4-1,CASTLE>Or that Chinese screen was meant for

105
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,800
<4-1,CASTLE>该摆在更大的公寓里
<4-1,CASTLE>A much bigger apartment.

106
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,500
<4-1,CASTLE>我在想  他们怎么付得起雷丁的学费
<4-1,CASTLE>I wonder how they could still afford Redding.

107
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,800
<4-2,BECKETT>-你知道那所学校  -纽约的
<4-2,BECKETT>- You know the school?  - Oh, I've been kicked out

108
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,100
<4-3,CASTLE>所有的优秀学校都开除过我
<4-3,CASTLE>Of all of New York's finer educational institutions

109
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
<4-3,CASTLE>至少一次
<4-3,CASTLE>At least once.

110
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,300
<4-3,CASTLE>讽刺的是  因为我现在有钱又有名
<4-3,CASTLE>The irony is, now that I'm rich and famous,

111
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
<4-3,CASTLE>他们都说我是校友  想让我捐钱
<4-3,CASTLE>They all claim me as alum and want money.

112
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
<4-4,BECKETT>-像你这真辛苦  -我该忍受的苦难
<4-4,BECKETT>-It is just so rough being you. -My cross to bear.

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
<4-4,BECKETT>当肯德尔夫妇说他们付不起学费时
<4-4,BECKETT>When the Kendalls said they couldn't afford tuition,

114
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
<4-5,CASTLE>我们给唐尼提供了奖学金
<4-5,CASTLE>We put Donny on scholarship.

115
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,400
<4-6,REDDING PREP SCHOOL>他们家曾经对学校非常慷慨
<4-6,REDDING PREP SCHOOL>The family had been very generous in the past,

116
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,700
<4-6,REDDING PREP SCHOOL>而且唐尼也是最棒的学生之一
<4-6,REDDING PREP SCHOOL>And Donny was one of our brightest.

117
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,200
<4-6,REDDING PREP SCHOOL>我们认为他会有很好的未来
<4-6,REDDING PREP SCHOOL>We thought he'd do great things.

118
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,450
<4-7,CASTLE>您知道他那么晚
<4-7,CASTLE>Any idea what he would've been doing

119
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,700
<4-7,CASTLE>在中央公园做什么吗
<4-7,CASTLE>In Central Park at night?

120
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,800
<4-7,CASTLE>好吧  事实上
<4-7,CASTLE>Well, the truth is,

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
<4-8,HEADMASTER>我们对这些孩子的了解  都只是冰山一角
<4-8,HEADMASTER>All these kids are icebergs. We only see the tip.

122
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,500
<4-8,HEADMASTER>如果你想知道其他信息
<4-8,HEADMASTER>If you wanna know the rest,

123
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,300
<4-8,HEADMASTER>你可能得和他的朋友们聊聊
<4-8,HEADMASTER>You should probably talk to his friends-

124
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,000
<4-8,HEADMASTER>阿曼达  罗米  布兰登  斯宾塞和麦克斯
<4-8,HEADMASTER>Amanda, Romy, Brandon, Spencer and Max.

125
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
<4-8,HEADMASTER>少了唐尼感觉很奇怪
<4-8,HEADMASTER>It's strange seeing them without Donny.

126
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,700
<4-9,BECKETT>谢谢
<4-9,BECKETT>Thank you.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
<4-10,CASTLE>谢谢
<4-10,CASTLE>Thanks.

128
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,900
<4-10,CASTLE>爆炸新闻  我爸妈去阿布扎比了
<4-10,CASTLE>Breaking news- my parents are off to Abu Dhabi,

129
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,500
<4-10,CASTLE>所以我家现在是自由区  晚上过来一起看
<4-10,CASTLE>So I'm in a rents-free zone. Come over tonight for

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,200
<4-10,CASTLE>与星共舞(真人秀节目)总决赛吧
<4-10,CASTLE>The "Dancing with the Stars" results show.

131
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,900
<4-10,CASTLE>七点半开始下注
<4-10,CASTLE>Betting opens at 7:30.

132
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,500
<4-10,CASTLE>然后开一桶我爸珍藏的16年份纯麦芽酒
<4-10,CASTLE>My dad's cask- aged, 16- year- old single malt opens next.

133
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,900
<5-1,BRANDON>那是在他家搬家和这事以前拍的
<5-1,BRANDON>That was before they moved and everything.

134
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
<5-2,BECKETT>你们中有谁昨晚和唐尼在一起吗
<5-2,BECKETT>Were any of you with Donny last night?

135
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,100
<5-3,SPENCER>我们放学的时候一起出去玩
<5-3,SPENCER>We hung out after school,

136
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,800
<5-3,SPENCER>但是五点左右就各回各家了
<5-3,SPENCER>But we all headed home around 5:00.

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,500
<5-4,BECKETT>你们知道他可能是为什么去公园吗
<5-4,BECKETT>Do you know of any reason he'd be in the park?

138
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,400
<5-4,BECKETT>孩子们  我上过约克预科
<5-4,BECKETT>Look, you guys, I went to York.

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,800
<5-4,BECKETT>我知道诚信制度  保护朋友
<5-4,BECKETT>I know all about honor codes and protecting your friends.

140
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,300
<5-5,AMANDA>你上过约克预科
<5-5,AMANDA>You went to York prep?

141
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,800
<5-6,BRANDON>那你怎么会当警察的
<5-6,BRANDON>How does a Yorkie end up a cop?

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,200
<6-1,BECKETT>天有不测风云  比如这样的事
<6-1,BECKETT>Things happen. Things like this.

143
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,400
<5-6,BRANDON>重点是  如果你们想要
<5-6,BRANDON>Point is, is that if you're trying

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,600
<5-7,BECKETT>保护你们朋友的隐私  我理解
<5-7,BECKETT>To protect your friend's memory, I get it.

145
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
<5-7,BECKETT>但总有一天会真相大白的
<5-7,BECKETT>But eventually, the truth comes out.

146
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,400
<5-7,BECKETT>但越快知道真相  我们就越容易
<5-7,BECKETT>And the faster it does, the easier it'll be for us

147
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
<5-7,BECKETT>找出凶手
<5-7,BECKETT>To help find who did it.

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
<5-8,BRANDON>他们家已经一无所有了
<5-8,BRANDON>His family had lost everything.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,500
<5-9,AMANDA>虽然大家无所谓  但是我们要出去玩的
<5-9,AMANDA>Not that we cared, but we go out, you know?

150
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,200
<5-10,ROMY>我们一直想帮他付  但他不愿意
<5-10,ROMY>We always offered to cover him, but he couldn't handle it.

151
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,600
<5-12,BECKETT>-他有点儿崩溃了  -怎么个崩溃法
<5-12,BECKETT>- Yeah, he just kinda fell apart. - Fell apart how?

152
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,200
<5-13,CASTLE>各位  他不会再卷入任何麻烦了
<5-13,CASTLE>Guys, he can't get in trouble.

153
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,500
<5-14,AMANDA>他似乎染上毒瘾了
<5-14,AMANDA>He kind of got into drugs.

154
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,900
<5-15,CASTLE>如果他没钱了  怎么支持吸毒的开销
<5-15,CASTLE>If he had money problems, how'd he support a drug habit?

155
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,600
<5-16,AMANDA>他开始在公园做毒品交易
<5-16,AMANDA>He started dealing... in the park.

156
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,300
<6-2,CASTLE>经典悲剧
<6-2,CASTLE>Classic tragedy.

157
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,500
<6-1,BECKETT>显赫的家族衰落了
<6-1,BECKETT>Prominent family falls into disrepute,

158
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,300
<6-1,BECKETT>-第二代们开始堕落  -然后坏事就来了
<6-1,BECKETT>- Scion spirals down... - And bad things happen.

159
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,200
<6-1,BECKETT>坏事当然会来
<6-1,BECKETT>Of course bad things happen.

160
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
<6-2,CASTLE>否则就不叫悲剧了
<6-2,CASTLE>Otherwise, it wouldn't be a tragedy.

161
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,900
<6-2,CASTLE>知道吗  在希腊语里
<6-2,CASTLE>Did you know, in the original Greek,

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,800
<6-2,CASTLE>悲剧的字面意思  是指山羊之歌
<6-2,CASTLE>"Tragedy" literally means "goat song"?

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
<6-2,CASTLE>好吧  其实我也搞不懂
<6-2,CASTLE>I know, it doesn't make any sense to me, either.

164
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,400
<6-2,CASTLE>但不管开始的故事如何
<6-2,CASTLE>But whatever that first story was,

165
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,200
<6-2,CASTLE>我总是忍不住去想
<6-2,CASTLE>I can't help but think

166
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
<6-2,CASTLE>那只山羊肯定遭遇了非常悲惨的事情
<6-2,CASTLE>Bad things must've happened to that goat.

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
<6-2,CASTLE>是  好的
<6-2,CASTLE>Yep. Okay.

169
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,400
<6-3,BECKETT>当然  好的  我马上到
<6-3,BECKETT>Of course. Sure, I’ll be right there.

170
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,800
<6-4,CASTLE>下次用免提嘛
<6-4,CASTLE>Next time, put it on speakerphone.

171
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,100
<6-4,CASTLE>我会想看你
<6-4,CASTLE>I'm gonna want to see the pictures of those

172
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
<7-1,BECKETT>-穿格子裙和过膝袜的照片  -你说什么?
<7-1,BECKETT>- Plaid skirts and knee socks. - Excuse me?

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,400
<7-2,CASTLE>我看过约克预科的校服
<7-2,CASTLE>I've seen those York school uniforms.

174
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,700
<7-3,BECKETT>好吧  我想加入你的扑克游戏
<7-3,BECKETT>Okay, I want in on your poker game.

175
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
<7-3,BECKETT>我上的是公立学校
<7-3,BECKETT>I went to public school.

176
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
<7-3,BECKETT>我这么说是想让他们觉得亲切点
<7-3,BECKETT>I just told them that to make them feel comfortable.

177
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,700
<7-4,CASTLE>演得不错嘛  斯特里普女士(著名女演员)
<7-4,CASTLE>Well played, Ms. Streep.

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
<7-5,BECKETT>是像走出非洲里的她  还是妈妈咪呀里的
<7-5,BECKETT>Which Meryl -"Out of Africa" or "Mamma Mia!"?

179
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,350
<7-7,RYAN>昨晚有人报警
<7-7,RYAN>So a 9-1-1 call comes in last night

180
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,100
<7-8,RYAN>大概是离这儿50米的地方
<7-8,RYAN>About 50 yards from here.

181
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,500
<7-8,RYAN>埃斯波西托正在追查  但我们发现这个
<7-8,RYAN>Esposito's following up, but we found this.

182
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,900
<7-8,RYAN>看着像泥巴  但其实是血迹
<7-8,RYAN>Looks like mud. It's actually blood.

183
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,500
<7-8,RYAN>表明他当时是坐在长凳上的
<7-8,RYAN>Figured he was sitting on top of the bench,

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,300
<7-8,RYAN>胸部中了一枪后
<7-8,RYAN>Takes one to the chest,

185
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,600
<7-8,RYAN>往后跌倒在这儿
<7-8,RYAN>Falls back over here...

186
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,800
<7-8,RYAN>然后被拖到了湖里
<7-8,RYAN>And then he's dragged to the lake.

187
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,300
<7-9,BECKETT>晚上坐在公园的长凳上干嘛
<7-9,BECKETT>So what's he doing sitting on a park bench at night?

188
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,750
<7-10,RYAN>我当缉毒警察时
<7-10,RYAN>During my Narc days,

189
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,200
<7-10,RYAN>这里是公开的交易场所
<7-10,RYAN>This area was pretty much an open bazaar,

190
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
<7-11,BECKETT>-尤其是夜里  -交易失败
<7-11,BECKETT>- Especially at night. - A drug deal gone bad.

191
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,500
<7-12,RYAN>接受过私立学校教育
<7-12,RYAN>Fancy private school education

192
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,800
<7-12,RYAN>也不代表就不蠢
<7-12,RYAN>Don't mean you aren't stupid.

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,150
<7-13,CASTLE>当过缉毒警察也不怎么样
<7-13,CASTLE>Neither does a career in narcotics.

194
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,500
<7-14,BECKETT>什么意思
<7-14,BECKETT>What are you talking about?

195
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,400
<7-15,CASTLE>这是很大面积的一滩血
<7-15,CASTLE>This is a very large pool of blood.

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
<7-16,BECKETT>蕾妮说过  击中他的是大口径手枪
<7-16,BECKETT>Lanie said he was shot with a large-caliber bullet.

197
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,800
<7-17,CASTLE>如果这个孩子是刚被杀就被拖走
<7-17,CASTLE>So if this kid is dragged when he's a fresh kill,

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,400
<7-17,CASTLE>延着这条路上不是该有更多血迹吗
<7-17,CASTLE>Wouldn't there be more of a blood trail?

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
<7-18,BECKETT>也就是他在这儿躺了会儿
<7-18,BECKETT>He was lying here for a while.

200
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,500
<7-19,RYAN>为什么会有人回来把他移走
<7-19,RYAN>Why would someone come back and move him?

201
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,200
<7-20,CASTLE>如果凶手是毒贩子  那么他会意识到
<7-20,CASTLE>If it was a drug dealer, then he's gonna realize

202
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,500
<7-20,CASTLE>尸体放在这儿
<7-20,CASTLE>The cops are gonna think drug dealer

203
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,100
<7-20,CASTLE>警察会想到毒贩子
<7-20,CASTLE>If they find a body here.

204
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,500
<7-21,BECKETT>就增加了他被逮到的几率
<7-21,BECKETT>Increasing his chances of getting caught.

205
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,200
<7-22,CASTLE>所以他把尸体拖到了那边
<7-22,CASTLE>So he drags the body over there

206
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,800
<7-22,CASTLE>只是为了转移我们的注意力
<7-22,CASTLE>Just to try to throw us off.

207
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
<7-23,RYAN>我不明白  卡塞尔
<7-23,RYAN>I don't know, Castle.

208
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,500
<7-23,RYAN>一个聪明的毒贩
<7-23,RYAN>A smart drug dealer?

209
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,600
<7-24,CASTLE>一切都在进化  为什么罪犯不能
<7-24,CASTLE>Ah, everything evolves. Why not criminals?

210
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,200
<8-1,BECKETT>她报的警
<8-1,BECKETT>9-1-1 caller?

211
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,700
<8-2,ESPOSITO>是的  法尔西诺太太
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, Mrs. Falcigno-

212
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,000
<8-2,ESPOSITO>昨晚遛狗时听到枪声
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Was walking her dog when she heard the shot last night.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,250
<8-2,ESPOSITO>她说几秒钟后
<8-2,ESPOSITO>A few seconds later,

214
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,500
<8-2,ESPOSITO>看见一个白人从她身边跑过
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Said she saw a white dude run past her.

215
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
<8-2,ESPOSITO>我让她看看嫌犯照片
<8-2,ESPOSITO>I got her looking through mug books

216
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
<8-2,ESPOSITO>都是在这一带抓到的毒贩
<8-2,ESPOSITO>At dealers arrested in that area.

217
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,900
<8-3,MRS FALSIGNO>警官  快过来
<8-3,MRS FALSIGNO>Hey, detective, get over here!

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
<8-4,ESPOSITO>看到你认识的了吗  法尔西诺太太
<8-4,ESPOSITO>See someone you recognize, Mrs. Falcigno?

219
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,300
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>不  我想念你才情洋溢的人格魅力  当然
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>No, I miss your sparkling personality. Yeah!

220
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,400
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>-我当时看到的就是这家伙  -你确定
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>- That's the guy I saw right here. - You sure?

221
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>还要给我测谎吗  就是他
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>What, do you want to give me a lie detector? That's him!

222
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,100
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>知道你为什么在这儿吗
<8-5,MRS FALSIGNO>Do you know why you're here?

223
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,600
<9-1,KENT SCOVILLE>不知道
<9-1,KENT SCOVILLE>No idea.

224
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,500
<9-2,BECKETT>逮捕你的警官说他曾看到你
<9-2,BECKETT>The arresting officer said that he saw you

225
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,300
<9-2,BECKETT>在公园进行毒品交易
<9-2,BECKETT>In a hand-to-hand sale of narcotics in the park.

226
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
<9-3,SCOVILLE>肯定是把我和别人弄混了
<9-3,SCOVILLE>Must have me confused with somebody else.

227
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,900
<9-4,BECKETT>是吗  你的意思是说
<9-4,BECKETT>Really? Is that what you're giving me,

228
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,700
<9-4,BECKETT>所有的毒贩子都长一个样
<9-4,BECKETT>That all drug dealers look alike?

229
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,800
<9-4,BECKETT>抓你可是人赃并获  斯科维尔先生
<9-4,BECKETT>You were arrested with money and dope, Mr. Scoville.

230
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,200
<9-4,BECKETT>而且事实上
<9-4,BECKETT>Given the fact that

231
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,500
<9-4,BECKETT>你可是早有两起重罪在身
<9-4,BECKETT>You have two prior felony sales on your sheet,

232
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,070
<9-4,BECKETT>你最好
<9-4,BECKETT>You should probably

233
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,610
<9-4,BECKETT>赶紧交代一切
<9-4,BECKETT>Come up with something better pretty quick.

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
<9-5,SCOVILLE>为什么你要这样跟我作对
<9-5,SCOVILLE>Why you jammin' me up like this?

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
<9-6,BECKETT>你昨天晚上在公园干什么
<9-6,BECKETT>What were you doing in the park last night?

236
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
<9-7,SCOVILLE>什么让你肯定我昨晚在公园
<9-7,SCOVILLE>What makes you think I was even in the park?

237
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,000
<9-8,BECKETT>一个非常可信的证人说她看见你
<9-8,BECKETT>A very reliable witness said she saw you

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,600
<9-8,BECKETT>半夜跑向72大街的方向
<9-8,BECKETT>Runnin' toward 72nd street about midnight.

239
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,750
<9-9,CASTLE>她不是该一针见血
<9-9,CASTLE>Shouldn't she put him on his heels,

240
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,900
<9-9,CASTLE>直接问枪杀案吗
<9-9,CASTLE>Go straight for the shooting?

241
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,200
<9-10,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>关键不在于这个
<9-10,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>It's not about putting him on his heels.

242
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
<9-10,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>主要是让公诉人立案
<9-10,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>It's about building a case for the D.A.

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,100
<9-11,SCOVILLE>那又怎么了  我在公园跑步  怎么样
<9-11,SCOVILLE>So? I was running in the park. So what?

244
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,000
<9-12,MONTGOMERY>她已经让他承认曾在犯罪现场了
<9-12,MONTGOMERY>See? She just got him to put himself at the crime scene.

245
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,400
<9-13,BECKETT>跑步不犯法  但是开枪杀人犯法
<9-13,BECKETT>So running isn't illegal, but shootin' someone is.

246
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,900
<9-14,SCOVILLE>开枪  杀人
<9-14,SCOVILLE>Shootin' someone?

247
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,200
<9-15,BECKETT>认识这个人吗  唐尼·肯德尔
<9-15,BECKETT>Do you recognize his person- Donny Kendall?

248
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
<9-16,SCOVILLE>从没见过
<9-16,SCOVILLE>Never seen him before.

249
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,100
<9-17,BECKETT>是吗  为什么我感觉
<9-17,BECKETT>Really? How come I'm getting the feeling

250
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,800
<9-17,BECKETT>你并没有完全跟我说实话呢
<9-17,BECKETT>That you're not being completely truthful with me?

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,500
<9-18,MONTGOMERY>看她  看好了
<9-18,MONTGOMERY>Watch this. Watch her now.

252
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,600
<9-19,SCOVILLE>我想要豁免权
<9-19,SCOVILLE>I want immunity.

253
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,500
<9-20,BECKETT>怎么获  因为你的腮腺炎
<9-20,BECKETT>From what? The mumps?

254
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,400
<9-20,BECKETT>你知道什么是第三次的失败者吗  斯科维尔
<9-20,BECKETT>Do you know what a 3- time loser is, Scoville?

255
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
<9-20,BECKETT>第三次被控重罪的人  要判无期徒刑
<9-20,BECKETT>It's a person facing a third felony conviction,

256
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,700
<9-20,BECKETT>事实上  我说的就是你
<9-20,BECKETT>Someone just like you, in fact.

257
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
<9-21,SCOVILLE>好吧  我看见过他
<9-21,SCOVILLE>All right. I seen him.

00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
<9-23,SCOVILLE>-昨天晚上  -是的  昨晚
<9-23,SCOVILLE>- Last night?  - Yeah, last night.

259
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,600
<9-24,MONTGOMERY>现在把他和受害人联系起来了
<9-24,MONTGOMERY>Just placed him with the victim.

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,500
<9-25,BECKETT>你卖毒品给他了
<9-25,BECKETT>You sell to him?

261
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,100
<9-26,SCOVILLE>没有
<9-26,SCOVILLE>No.

262
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
<9-27,BECKETT>你是个毒贩  怎么认识他的
<9-27,BECKETT>You're a drug dealer. How'd you know him?

263
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,100
<9-27,BECKETT>通过你的牌友们
<9-27,BECKETT>You poker buddies?

264
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,700
<9-27,BECKETT>跟你交谈真愉快啊  斯科维尔先生
<9-27,BECKETT>It was real nice chatting with you, Mr. Scoville.

265
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,500
<9-27,BECKETT>也许25年后你能写信给我
<9-27,BECKETT>Maybe you can drop me a line in about 25 years.

266
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,800
<9-28,SCOVILLE>等等  我都说  我全都说
<9-28,SCOVILLE>All right, all right, hold up. Hold up. All right!

<9-31,BECKETT>小伙伴

<9-33,BECKETT>说清楚点

<9-37,MONTGOMERY>现在我们找到证人了
<9-37,MONTGOMERY>And now we got some witnesses.

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
<9-38,CASTLE>说谎的证人

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,000
<10-1,BECKETT>你们没跟我说实话
<10-1,BECKETT>You guys lied to me.

281

<10-1,BECKETT>唐尼中枪的时候你们都在  是不是
<10-1,BECKETT>You were all with Donny when he got shot, weren't you?

<10-1,BECKETT>知道什么叫妨碍司法公正吗
<10-1,BECKETT>Anyone know what obstruction is?

283
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,400
<10-2,CASTLE>如果你们在罪案调查中
<10-2,CASTLE>I believe that's when you deliberately

284
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,500
<10-2,CASTLE>蓄意提供虚假信息
<10-2,CASTLE>Give false information in a criminal case.

285
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,600
<10-3,BECKETT>是要坐牢的
<10-3,BECKETT>You go to prison for it.

286

<10-3,BECKETT>麦克斯

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,700
<10-5,BECKETT>你们当时在公园
<10-5,BECKETT>You were at the park?

290

<10-6,ROMY>唐尼已经失控了  我们只是想阻止他
<10-6,ROMY>Donny was out of control. We were just trying to stop him.

291
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,400
<10-7,CASTLE>我怎么觉得你没说实话
<10-7,CASTLE>Why don't I believe you?

292
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
<10-8,BRANDON>伙计们  说出真相吧
<10-8,BRANDON>Guys, just tell the truth.

293
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,700
<10-8,BRANDON>有时候  我们也会去公园
<10-8,BRANDON>Sometimes we'd go to the park, too.

294
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,400
<10-9,SPENCER>然后跟父母说
<10-9,SPENCER>We'd tell our parents

295
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,900
<10-9,SPENCER>我们去其中一个人的家里玩
<10-9,SPENCER>We're hanging out at one of our apartments,

296
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,600
<10-9,SPENCER>但实际上我们去公园或者聚会
<10-9,SPENCER>But we'd actually go to the park and party,

297
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
<10-9,SPENCER>然后唐尼就会
<10-9,SPENCER>And Donny would-

298
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,100
<10-10,CASTLE>给你们任何想要的东西
<10-10,CASTLE>Would get you whatever you wanted.

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,100
<10-11,BECKETT>到底发生了什么
<10-11,BECKETT>So what happened?

300
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,300
<10-12,BRANDON>我们当时在一起  玩得很开心
<10-12,BRANDON>We're all just hanging out, having a good time, partying.

301
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,100
<10-12,BRANDON>然后那家伙走过来  搞砸了一切
<10-12,BRANDON>And this guy came over, and he's a messed up,

302
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,300
<10-12,BRANDON>他拿着把枪  而且他
<10-12,BRANDON>And he's got this gun. And he- and he's-

303
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,350
<10-12,BRANDON>他冲着唐尼喊
<10-12,BRANDON>He's yelling at Donny

304
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,400
<10-12,BRANDON>我的钱呢  我他妈要我的钱
<10-12,BRANDON>"Where’s my money? I need my friggin' money!"

305
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,000
<10-12,BRANDON>唐尼欠他两百块  但当时身上没钱
<10-12,BRANDON>Donny owes him 200 bucks. Donny didn't have it.

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
<10-14,AMANDA>那个人用枪指着他  然后听到砰的一声
<10-14,AMANDA>Then the guy points the gun. And there's this loud pop,

307
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
<10-15,ROMY>唐尼就倒在地上了
<10-15,ROMY>And you just see Donny's body crumple.

308
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,300
<10-16,BECKETT>那你们呢
<10-16,BECKETT>What did you guys do?

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,400
<10-17,MAX>我们跑了 我们吓跑了
<10-17,MAX>We ran. We just ran.

310
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,100
<10-18,BECKETT>你们没想到要报警吗
<10-18,BECKETT>You didn't think to call the police?

311
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,720
<10-19,SPENCER>他死了
<10-19,SPENCER>He was dead.

312
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,900
<10-19,SPENCER>我们知道他死了  如果报警了
<10-19,SPENCER>I mean, we knew he was dead. Calling someone-

313
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,500
<10-20,CASTLE>你们就会有麻烦了
<10-20,CASTLE>Would have just gotten you into trouble?

314
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,200
<10-21,BECKETT>你们看清楚了那个人的长相吗
<10-21,BECKETT>Did you get a good look at this guy?

315
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,900
<10-21,BECKETT>能指认他吗
<10-21,BECKETT>Do you think you'd be able to identify him?

316
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,900
<10-22,SPENCER>当时天很暗
<10-22,SPENCER>It- it was dark.

317
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,200
<10-22,SPENCER>唐尼坐在长椅的另一头
<10-22,SPENCER>You know, Donny was at the end of the bench.

318
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
<10-23,BECKETT>那谁离得最近
<10-23,BECKETT>Who was the closest?

<11-2,BECKETT>他们不会知道我们在这儿
<11-2,BECKETT>They have no idea who's back here.

<12-2,CASTLE>谁会知道  这么多年过去了
<12-2,CASTLE>Who'd have thought, all these years later,

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,900
<12-2,CASTLE>你还是这么可爱呢

<12-4,CASTLE>每呼吸10到15次  你会发出点小噪音
<12-4,CASTLE>Well, every 10 or 15 breaths, you make a little snort noise.

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,590
<12-4,CASTLE>有时候甚至吹起泡泡
<12-4,CASTLE>And then sometimes you'll even get a little spit bubble-

<12-12,CASTLE>除非你病了

<12-17,ALEXIS>可以肯定  我是没有吸毒的
<12-17,ALEXIS>For parents and teachers, it's a pretty safe bet I'm clean.

360
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,800
<12-18,CASTLE>你分析得很棒
<12-18,CASTLE>You make an excellent case.

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,900
<12-24,CASTLE>在酒店开派对的人
<12-24,CASTLE>And partying winehouse-style?

371
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,340
<12-25,ALEXIS>因为你很了解他们
<12-25,ALEXIS>Um, because you know them really well,

372
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,530
<12-25,ALEXIS>知道他们是好孩子
<12-25,ALEXIS>and they're good kids?

373
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,280
<12-26,CASTLE>我的了解可能只是冰山一角
<12-26,CASTLE>But maybe they're icebergs.

374
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,660
<12-27,ALEXIS>你说这些  是跟雷丁那个男生有关吗
<12-27,ALEXIS>Does this have something to do with that Redding kid?

<12-27,ALEXIS>爸爸  他大半夜待在中央公园
<12-27,ALEXIS>Dad, he was in Central Park really, really late at night.

<12-28,CASTLE>其实如果你做过  可以告诉我
<12-28,CASTLE>But if you did, you could tell me.

<12-28,CASTLE>我不想让你  非得跟我说谎
<12-28,CASTLE>I don't want you to feel you ever have to lie to me.

379

<12-28,CASTLE>无论你和朋友们做过什么
<12-28,CASTLE>Anything you and your friends have done,

386
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
<12-29,ALEXIS>对
<12-29,ALEXIS>Right.

387
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,960
<12-30,CASTLE>朋友就是这样的
<12-30,CASTLE>Because that's what friends do.

390
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,960
<13-2,CASTLE>为什么唐尼的朋友不给毒贩钱呢
<13-2,CASTLE>Why didn't Donny's friends just give him the money?

391
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,720
<13-3,BECKETT>在说什么呢
<13-3,BECKETT>What are you talking about?

<13-4,CASTLE>没有一个借他救命钱呢
<13-4,CASTLE>one of them couldn't spring a few bucks to save his life?

395
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,560
<13-5,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  发疯的毒贩挥着把枪
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Castle, some demented drug dealer's waving a gun.

396
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,260
<13-5,ESPOSITO>他们大概吓傻了
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Um, they probably froze up.

397
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,660
<13-6,CASTLE>全部都是吗  他又不是在问高考题
<13-6,CASTLE>But all of them? He wasn't asking S.A.T. questions.

398
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,460
<13-6,CASTLE>他只是要钱
<13-6,CASTLE>He was asking for money

399
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,160
<13-6,CASTLE>这些孩子睡着了都会数钱
<13-6,CASTLE>Something these kids probably count in their sleep.

400
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,660
<13-7,ESPOSITO>这个斯科维尔是个坏家伙
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Look, this Scoville is a bad dude,

401
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
<13-7,ESPOSITO>而且证据确凿
<13-7,ESPOSITO>And we got more than enough.

402

<13-8,RYAN>对  有那个女孩  我们赢定了
<13-8,RYAN>Yeah, with the girl, it's a slam dunk.

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,160
<13-9,CASTLE>你们怎么找到那个女孩的
<13-9,CASTLE>And who gave you the girl?

404
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,860
<13-10,BECKETT>斯科维尔说的
<13-10,BECKETT>Scoville.

405
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,860
<13-11,RYAN>所以这家伙并不聪明
<13-11,RYAN>So the guy's not a genius.

406
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
<13-11,RYAN>行行行  就算你是对的
<13-11,RYAN>Okay, okay. Say you're right.

407

<13-12,ESPOSITO>这些孩子为什么咬定一个不相干的人谋杀
<13-12,ESPOSITO>Why would these kids peg the wrong guy for a murder?

408
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,660
<13-13,CASTLE>简单  他们中的一个是真凶

<14-6,YENKMAN>Yeah? Well, uh, shouldn't you consult the consultant

414
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
<14-6,YENKMAN>咨询一下你的顾问呢
<14-6,YENKMAN>Before you arrest the wrong guy?

415
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,660
<14-7,BECKETT>我还不确定是否抓错人  扬克姆安
<14-7,BECKETT>I'm not sure I have the wrong guy yet, Yankman.

416
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,410
<14-8,YENKMAN>我的当事人不高兴了
<14-8,YENKMAN>Well, my client's not happy.

417
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,160
<14-8,YENKMAN>是他为你们提供的潜在证人
<14-8,YENKMAN>He gave you potential witnesses,

418
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,060
<14-8,YENKMAN>你们却用其中一个来对付他
<14-8,YENKMAN>And then you used one against him.

419
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,260
<14-9,BECKETT>你的当事人并不乐意提供消息
<14-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, your client wasn't exactly forthcoming.

420
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,160
<14-9,BECKETT>但是  如果他肯向我坦白一切
<14-9,BECKETT>But I'm willing to reconsider

421
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,660
<14-9,BECKETT>我会重新考虑的
<14-9,BECKETT>If he tells me everything he knows.

422
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,560
<14-10,SCOVILLE>别相信她
<14-10,SCOVILLE>Don't trust her.

423
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,360
<14-11,CASTLE>想想你是怎么被控谋杀的
<14-11,CASTLE>Seeing as how you're facing a murder charge,

424
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,660
<14-11,CASTLE>为什么不听大家的意见呢
<14-11,CASTLE>Why don't you just go with the flow?

425
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,460
<14-12,YENKMAN>小顾问是对的  你是破罐子破摔了
<14-12,YENKMAN>Consultant boy is right. You got nothing to lose.

426
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,960
<14-13,BECKETT>唐尼被杀那晚
<14-13,BECKETT>The night that Donny was killed,

427
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,660
<14-13,BECKETT>你卖毒品给他和他的朋友了  是吗
<14-13,BECKETT>You sold to him and his friends, right?

00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,060
<14-15,BECKETT>-没有  -没有吗

429
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,060
<14-16,YENKMAN>你这样是不会让她重新考虑的
<14-16,YENKMAN>That's not how you really get her to reconsider.

430
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,560
<14-16,YENKMAN>我没有卖给他
<14-16,YENKMAN>I didn't sell to him!

431
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,360
<14-17,SCOVILLE>他们为我工作
<14-17,SCOVILLE>They were workin' for me.

432
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,860
<14-18,BECKETT>为你工作
<14-18,BECKETT>Workin' for you?

<14-19,SCOVILLE>我给那个小混蛋供货
<14-19,SCOVILLE>I supplied that punk.

434
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,260
<14-19,SCOVILLE>他的朋友也是从我这儿买进
<14-19,SCOVILLE>All right? His friends bought off me, too.

435
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
<14-19,SCOVILLE>他们再倒卖
<14-19,SCOVILLE>Then they'd go play dealer,

436
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,360
<14-19,SCOVILLE>给绵羊草地(中央公园景观)的上流客户
<14-19,SCOVILLE>selling to the upscales up in Sheeps Meadow.

437
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
<14-20,BECKETT>等等  他们替你卖毒品
<14-20,BECKETT>Wait a minute. They sold for you?

438
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,960
<14-21,SCOVILLE>唐尼是的  其他人游手好闲
<14-21,SCOVILLE>Donny, yeah. The others, it was just like a goof,

439
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,260
<14-21,SCOVILLE>他们的生活很疯狂  就像真心话大冒险
<14-21,SCOVILLE>Like walk on the Wild Side, like Truth or Dare.

440
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,160
<14-22,BECKETT>那么唐尼被杀的时候你在哪儿
<14-22,BECKETT>So where were you when Donny got shot?

441
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,660
<14-23,SCOVILLE>我当时跟一帮朋友
<14-23,SCOVILLE>I was hanging with my boys down by

442
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,360
<14-23,SCOVILLE>在爱丽丝梦游仙境雕塑那儿
<14-23,SCOVILLE>The "Alice in Wonderland" statue.

443
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,960
<14-23,SCOVILLE>我们什么都没看见  听到那声枪响就跑了
<14-23,SCOVILLE>We didn't see nothing. We heard the shot, took off.

444
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,560
<14-25,SCOVILLE>-那枪呢  -我告诉你了  我没带枪
<14-25,SCOVILLE>- What about the gun?  - I told you, I don't pack.

445
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,360
<14-26,YENKMAN>记录显示他从未因为枪支获罪
<14-26,YENKMAN>Criminal record with no firearms convictions

446
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,260
<14-26,YENKMAN>听上去是说实话了
<14-26,YENKMAN>Does sort of give it the ring of truth.

447
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,260
<14-26,YENKMAN>如果过去不过是序幕  重新审查该怎么做
<14-26,YENKMAN>If past is prologue, how we doing on reconsideration?

<14-26,YENKMAN>你们跟我开玩笑吧
<14-26,YENKMAN>You gotta be kidding me.

452
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,960
<14-26,YENKMAN>我已经告诉上头说抓到人了
<14-26,YENKMAN>I already told the brass that we got the guy.

453
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,260
<15-1,CASTLE>我知道这比较尴尬
<15-1,CASTLE>I can see how that'd be a little awkward.

454
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,960
<15-2,MONTGOMERY>市长都打电话来感谢我
<15-2,MONTGOMERY>The mayor even called to thank me.

455
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,260
<15-2,MONTGOMERY>-他会去看尼克斯队(NBA球队)的比赛  -很好
<15-2,MONTGOMERY>- He's in for the Knicks game, by the way.  - Sweet.

456
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,860
<15-4,BECKETT>大家都希望这个残暴的毒贩是凶手
<15-4,BECKETT>Look, I know everyone likes the violent drug dealer for this-

457
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,360
<15-5,MONTGOMERY>不  是非常非常希望
<15-5,MONTGOMERY>No, we love the violent drug dealer for this.

458
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,460
<15-6,BECKETT>但残暴的毒贩的口供
<15-6,BECKETT>Only the violent drug dealer's story

459
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,200
<15-6,BECKETT>比证人的更可信
<15-6,BECKETT>makes more sense than our witness'.

460
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,960
<15-7,CASTLE>虽然我是新来的  但是
<15-7,CASTLE>Plus- and I know I'm new here but-

461
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,860
<15-7,CASTLE>你们应该抓住真凶是吗
<15-7,CASTLE>Aren't you supposed to arrest the right guy?

462
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,160
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>好  再去跟那个女孩谈谈
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>Okay, go and talk to the girl again.

463
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,460
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>但是没有我的命令  毒贩谁都不能放
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>But my violent drug dealer stays where he is until I say so.

464
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>球赛见
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>I'll see you at the game.

465
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,760
<15-9,CASTLE>收到
<15-9,CASTLE>Got it.

466
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
<16-1,BECKETT>你说过毒贩向唐尼索要
<16-1,BECKETT>So this dealer asked Donny

467
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
<16-1,BECKETT>欠他的几百块
<16-1,BECKETT>for the couple hundred he owed him,

468
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,360
<16-2,ROMY>-对吗  -没错
<16-2,ROMY>- Right?  - Yeah.

469
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,060
<16-3,BECKETT>但是唐尼说他没这么多钱
<16-3,BECKETT>And Donny told him he didn't have it?

470
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,760
<16-4,ROMY>是的
<16-4,ROMY>Right.

471
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,360
<16-5,BECKETT>你介意我看一看你的钱包吗
<16-5,BECKETT>You mind if I take a look at your purse?

472
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,260
<16-6,MRS LEE>她的钱包  为什么
<16-6,MRS LEE>Her purse? What for?

473
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,860
<16-7,BECKETT>如果有需要  我可以申请搜查令
<16-7,BECKETT>I can get a warrant if you want.

474
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,660
<16-7,BECKETT>古奇的包
<16-7,BECKETT>Gucci.

475
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,460
<16-8,ROMY>我的包跟这个有什么关系
<16-8,ROMY>What does my bag have to do with anything?

476
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,310
<16-9,BECKETT>如果唐尼真是你的好朋友
<16-9,BECKETT>If Donny was such a good friend,

477
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,760
<16-9,BECKETT>为什么眼睁睁看着他被杀
<16-9,BECKETT>Why did you let him get shot?

478
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,860
<16-10,ROMY>眼睁睁看着
<16-10,ROMY>Let him?

479
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,760
<16-11,BECKETT>你用足够的钱付给那个人
<16-11,BECKETT>You had more than enough money to pay off the guy.

480
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,660
<16-11,BECKETT>我相信你们都有足够的钱
<16-11,BECKETT>I bet you all had more than enough.

481
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,660
<16-11,BECKETT>但是唐尼还是死了
<16-11,BECKETT>And yet Donny is dead.

482
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,160
<16-11,BECKETT>为什么没有一个人帮他还钱
<16-11,BECKETT>Why didn't any of you front him the money?

483
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,360
<16-12,MR LEE>你在暗示什么
<16-12,MR LEE>What are you implying?

484
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,560
<16-13,CASTLE>她没有暗示
<16-13,CASTLE>She isn't implying.

485
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,960
<16-13,CASTLE>她是直说  关于当晚
<16-13,CASTLE>She's saying your daughter is lying about

486
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
<16-13,CASTLE>你的女儿在说谎
<16-13,CASTLE>about what happened that night.

487
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,060
<16-14,BECKETT>根本就没有那个人  对吗  罗米
<16-14,BECKETT>There wasn't a guy, was there, Romy?

488
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,930
<16-15,ROMY>我什么也没做
<16-15,ROMY>I- I didn't do anything.

489
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,930
<16-16,MR LEE>罗米
<16-16,MR LEE>Romy.

490
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,230
<16-17,BECKETT>那晚唐尼到底怎么了
<16-17,BECKETT>What really happened to Donny that night?

491
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,130
<16-18,ROMY>是场意外
<16-18,ROMY>It was an accident.

492
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,930
<16-18,ROMY>当时我们在玩游戏
<16-18,ROMY>We were just playing a game.

493
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,630
<16-19,BECKETT>游戏
<16-19,BECKETT>A game?

494
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,730
<16-20,ROMY>-有点像俄式轮盘赌  -罗米  用枪吗
<16-20,ROMY>- Like Russian roulette. - Romy! With a gun?

495
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,530
<16-22,ROMY>只是好玩  我们玩了好多回了
<16-22,ROMY>It was just for fun. We- we did it all the time.

496
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,230
<16-23,MR LEE>好玩
<16-23,MR LEE>For fun?

<16-24,BECKETT>-罗米你从哪儿来的枪  -斯宾塞的
<16-24,BECKETT>- Where'd you get the gun, Romy? - Spencer had it.

498
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,230
<16-25,ROMY>我们没想到枪里有子弹
<16-25,ROMY>We never meant for there to be bullets.

499
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,130
<16-25,ROMY>我们只是用枪指着对方
<16-25,ROMY>We just pointed the gun at each other

500
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,130
<16-25,ROMY>扣动扳机  体验那一刻的感受
<16-25,ROMY>And pulled the trigger, just to see what it felt like.

501
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,830
<16-26,BECKETT>-唐尼是怎么中枪的  -斯宾塞买的子弹
<16-26,BECKETT>- Then how did Donny get shot? - Spencer bought bullets.

502
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,830
<16-27,ROMY>我们去他家在蒙托克(度假胜地)的避暑别墅
<16-27,ROMY>We went up to his summer house in Montauk

503
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,630
<16-27,ROMY>只是射击罐子和别的东西
<16-27,ROMY>Just to shoot around at cans and stuff.

504
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,830
<16-27,ROMY>一颗子弹无意中留在了枪里
<16-27,ROMY>One must have got left in by accident.

<16-28,BECKETT>是谁  开枪打死了他
<16-28,BECKETT>Who? Who shot him?

537
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,480
<18-6,ALEXIS>记得那个假日聚会吗
<18-6,ALEXIS>Remember the holiday formal,

538
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,080
<18-6,ALEXIS>之后我和凯尔茜是怎么离开泰勒家的
<18-6,ALEXIS>How Kelsey and I went to Taylor's house after?

539
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
<18-6,ALEXIS>我们离开的时候  天开始下雨
<18-6,ALEXIS>Well, when we left, it was already raining,

540
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,180
<18-6,ALEXIS>我们花了半小时打出租车
<18-6,ALEXIS>And we tried for, like, half an hour to get a taxi,

541
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,480
<18-6,ALEXIS>还是没打到车
<18-6,ALEXIS>But we couldn't,

542
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,780
<18-6,ALEXIS>我们都湿透了很冷
<18-6,ALEXIS>and we were already so soaking wet and cold

543
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,780
<18-6,ALEXIS>于是最后决定去坐地铁
<18-6,ALEXIS>That we finally decided to take the subway,

544
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,780
<18-6,ALEXIS>尽管已经十点多了
<18-6,ALEXIS>Even though it was way after 10:00.

545
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,380
<18-7,CASTLE>但考虑到  在雨中打到车的可能性
<18-7,CASTLE>Well, considering that getting a cab in the rain

546
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,030
<18-7,CASTLE>就像强力球(美国全国性彩票)中头奖
<18-7,CASTLE>Is kind of like winning the Powerball jackpot,

547
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,780
<18-7,CASTLE>我原谅你了
<18-7,CASTLE>I forgive you.

548
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,210
<18-8,ALEXIS>不是  听着  2号线有车来了
<18-8,ALEXIS>No, listen. The 2 was coming,

549
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,690
<18-8,ALEXIS>凯尔茜跑过大门
<18-8,ALEXIS>And Kelsey ran through the door

550
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,290
<18-8,ALEXIS>下楼去帮我开着门
<18-8,ALEXIS>And was going down the stairs to hold the door for me,

551
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,790
<18-8,ALEXIS>但我刷卡的时候  已经没钱了
<18-8,ALEXIS>But when I swiped my card, it was empty,

552
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,490
<18-8,ALEXIS>我没时间去充钱
<18-8,ALEXIS>And I didn't have any time to add any more money to it,

553
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,090
<18-8,ALEXIS>凯尔茜叫我快点过去  所以我
<18-8,ALEXIS>And Kelsey was screaming for me to come, and I was-

554
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,990
<18-8,ALEXIS>我很累  急着回家
<18-8,ALEXIS>I was just so tired, and I was just anxious to get home,

555
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,790
<18-8,ALEXIS>-爸爸  我都不想说了  -怎么了
<18-8,ALEXIS>- That, dad... I don't even want to say it. - What?

556
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,890
<18-10,ALEXIS>我跳过栅门  逃票了
<18-10,ALEXIS>I jumped the turnstile.

557
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,490
<18-11,CASTLE>那你坐上地铁了吗
<18-11,CASTLE>Did you make the train?

558
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,190
<18-12,ALEXIS>坐上了  关键是我没告诉你
<18-12,ALEXIS>Y- yeah, but- but the point is, I didn't tell you,

559
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,590
<18-12,ALEXIS>尽管昨天你那么好  那么担心我
<18-12,ALEXIS>Even after you were so sweet and concerned yesterday.

560
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,890
<18-13,CASTLE>-对不起  -你真的跳过栅门了
<18-13,CASTLE>- I'm sorry. - Oh, you actually jumped the turnstile?

561
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,390
<18-14,ALEXIS>第二天我刷了两次卡
<18-14,ALEXIS>But I swiped my card twice the next day

562
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,590
<18-14,ALEXIS>但是我都没坐
<18-14,ALEXIS>And didn't even ride.

563
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,190
<18-15,CASTLE>好吧  宝贝  如果
<18-15,CASTLE>Okay. Oh, sweetie. If that-

564
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,890
<18-15,CASTLE>如果这是你做过的最差劲的事
<18-15,CASTLE>If that's the worst thing you've done,

565
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,790
<18-15,CASTLE>那我真是个幸福的父亲
<18-15,CASTLE>I'm a happy, happy man.

566
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,590
<18-16,ALEXIS>但是我说谎了  难道你不惩罚我吗
<18-16,ALEXIS>But I lied to you. Shouldn't you punish me?

567
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,990
<18-17,CASTLE>当然了
<18-17,CASTLE>Yes. No, you're right.

568
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,490
<18-17,CASTLE>冰激凌做为早餐  无条件执行
<18-17,CASTLE>Um... Mandatory ice cream for breakfast. No excuses.

569
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,190
<18-18,ALEXIS>我是认真的  我会自己惩罚自己
<18-18,ALEXIS>I'm serious. If you won't, I will.

570
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,390
<18-19,CASTLE>冰激凌的惩罚  我也是认真的
<18-19,CASTLE>I'm serious about the ice cream.

571
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,890
<18-20,ALEXIS>好吧  这个礼拜我禁足
<18-20,ALEXIS>Fine. I'm grounded for a week.

572
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,490
<18-21,CASTLE>-虽然苛刻但也合理  -在华盛顿之行后吧
<18-21,CASTLE>- All right. You're tough but fair. - After the D.C. Trip.

573
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,290
<18-23,CASTLE>真是我的好女儿
<18-23,CASTLE>That's my girl.

574
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,190
<18-24,ALEXIS>谢谢你  爸爸
<18-24,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad.

575
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,490
<18-24,ALEXIS>-在干吗呢  -一些文件
<18-24,ALEXIS>- What you doing? - Paperwork to dismiss

576
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,390
<19-1,BECKETT>要撤销对斯科维尔的指控
<19-1,BECKETT>The homicide charges against Scoville.

577
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,190
<19-1,BECKETT>弹道学证实  麦克斯自杀的这把枪
<19-1,BECKETT>Ballistics confirms that the gun used on Donny

578
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,590
<19-1,BECKETT>就是当晚在公园里
<19-1,BECKETT>In the park that night was the same one

579
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,990
<19-1,BECKETT>杀害唐尼的那把
<19-1,BECKETT>Max used on himself.

580
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,290
<19-1,BECKETT>我擅长揣摩人的心思
<19-1,BECKETT>I'm usually better at reading people.

581
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,320
<19-2,CASTLE>你和麦克斯呆了半小时
<19-2,CASTLE>You spent half an hour with Max.

582
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,950
<19-2,CASTLE>你不可能看清楚整件事
<19-2,CASTLE>There's no way you could have seen that coming.

583
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,790
<19-3,BECKETT>可怜的孩子  肯定很痛苦
<19-3,BECKETT>Poor kid must have been a mess.

584
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,700
<19-3,BECKETT>想象枪杀你最好的朋友
<19-3,BECKETT>Imagine shooting your best friend

585
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,950
<19-3,BECKETT>但你不得不一直隐瞒此事
<19-3,BECKETT>And then having to lie about it.

586
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,190
<19-4,CASTLE>他可不只是隐瞒此事
<19-4,CASTLE>Well, he did more than just lie about it.

587
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,970
<19-5,BECKETT>你是什么意思
<19-5,BECKETT>What do you mean?

588
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,990
<19-6,CASTLE>他回到案发地点  搬走了他朋友的尸体
<19-6,CASTLE>He went back and moved his friend's body.

589
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,590
<19-6,CASTLE>他回到案发地点  搬走了他朋友的尸体
<19-6,CASTLE>He went back and moved his friend's body.

590
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,820
<19-7,BECKETT>镇定自若地移尸
<19-7,BECKETT>Having the presence of mind to move the body

591
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,380
<19-7,BECKETT>这跟他的内疚情绪是否自相矛盾
<19-7,BECKETT>Isn't exactly consistent with a guilty conscience, is it?

592
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,700
<19-8,CASTLE>我想说  这超过了冷血杀手之所为
<19-8,CASTLE>I'd say that's more an act of a cold-blooded killer.

593
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,200
<19-9,BECKETT>冷血杀手不会突然有内疚感
<19-9,BECKETT>And a cold-blooded killer doesn't suddenly feel guilty

594
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,300
<19-9,BECKETT>而去自杀  对不对
<19-9,BECKETT>Enough to commit suicide, does he?

595
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,000
<19-10,CASTLE>我的小说里没写过
<19-10,CASTLE>Not in any story I'd write.

596
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,200
<19-11,BECKETT>如果我们没错  不是麦克斯移尸
<19-11,BECKETT>So if we're right and Max didn't move Donny's body,

597
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,300
<19-11,BECKETT>那会是谁呢
<19-11,BECKETT>Then who did?

598
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,200
<19-13,LANIE>看起来像是普通的自杀案
<19-13,LANIE>Looks like your basic, garden- variety suicide.

599
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,100
<19-14,BECKETT>但是你在电话里说有些疑点
<19-14,BECKETT>But you said on the phone that there was something

600
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,350
<19-14,BECKETT>是与自杀有矛盾的
<19-14,BECKETT>That wasn't consistent with a suicide.

601
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,100
<19-14,BECKETT>看起来像是自杀
<19-14,BECKETT>Looks like suicide.

602
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,700
<19-15,LANIE>但仔细研究他开枪的手
<19-15,LANIE>But his shooting hand- more specifically,

603
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,200
<19-15,LANIE>右手食指有细微的擦伤
<19-15,LANIE>His right index finger- has a slight abrasion

604
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,500
<19-15,LANIE>在显微镜下才能看到  在验尸报告里
<19-15,LANIE>Visible only under the scope. Department autopsy protocol

605
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
<19-15,LANIE>可是一点儿都没提
<19-15,LANIE>Doesn't even call to look for that kind of thing.

606
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,300
<19-16,BECKETT>你怎么看这处擦伤
<19-16,BECKETT>And the abrasion means what to you?

607
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,900
<19-17,LANIE>另有其人帮他扣动了扳机
<19-17,LANIE>That someone may have helped him pull the trigger.

608
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,300
<19-17,LANIE>毒理分析显示他的血液酒精含量为0.28
<19-17,LANIE>Plus toxicology has his blood alcohol content at.28.

609
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,700
<19-19,BECKETT>-0.28  -所以他喝醉了
<19-19,BECKETT>- .28! - So he was drunk

610
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,600
<19-20,CASTLE>酩酊大醉
<19-20,CASTLE>Way drunk.

611
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
<19-21,LANIE>酒精含量0.28  他可能毫无知觉
<19-21,LANIE>At.28, he may not have even been conscious.

612
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
<19-22,BECKETT>所以麦克斯是被谋杀的
<19-22,BECKETT>So Max was murdered.

613
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,900
<19-22,BECKETT>导演麦克斯自杀的人  想让我们相信
<19-22,BECKETT>Whoever staged Max's suicide wanted us to believe that

614
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,500
<19-22,BECKETT>他的自杀是由于杀死唐尼的负罪感
<19-22,BECKETT>He killed himself out of guilt over shooting Donny,

615
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,300
<19-22,BECKETT>这让我相信不是麦克斯杀死唐尼
<19-22,BECKETT>Which makes me think Max didn't kill Donny after all.

616
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,100
<20-1,CASTLE>但其他孩子证实了罗米的描述
<20-1,CASTLE>The other kids corroborated Romy's story

617
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,600
<20-1,CASTLE>是麦克斯扣动了扳机
<20-1,CASTLE>That Max pulled the trigger.

618
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,100
<20-2,BECKETT>我并非说不是他开的枪
<20-2,BECKETT>I didn't say he didn't shoot him.

619
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,600
<20-2,BECKETT>我说的是  不是他要杀唐尼
<20-2,BECKETT>I said he didn't kill him.

620
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,500
<20-3,CASTLE>是禅宗公案说的孤掌难鸣吗
<20-3,CASTLE>Is that a zen koan "one hand clapping" thing? I...

621
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,300
<20-4,BECKETT>这群孩子玩游戏
<20-4,BECKETT>These kids played a game of pretending

622
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,500
<20-4,BECKETT>假装朝对方开枪
<20-4,BECKETT>To shoot at each other.

623
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,200
<20-4,BECKETT>要是某人真的想让唐尼死呢
<20-4,BECKETT>What if one of them wanted Donny dead for real?

624
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,820
<20-4,BECKETT>还有什么能比
<20-4,BECKETT>What better way than to

625
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,400
<20-4,BECKETT>让别人替他扣动扳机更好呢
<20-4,BECKETT>Get someone else to pull the trigger?

626
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,900
<20-5,CASTLE>你认为在枪里放子弹的另有其人
<20-5,CASTLE>You think one of the other kids put a bullet in the gun

627
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,400
<20-6,BECKETT>-而麦克斯却不知道  -这个人就是凶手
<20-6,BECKETT>- Without Max knowing? - That's our killer.

628
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,800
<20-7,CASTLE>确实如此
<20-7,CASTLE>Oh, I like that.

629
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,500
<20-7,CASTLE>斯宾塞  子弹是你买的
<20-7,CASTLE>You bought the bullets, Spencer.

630
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,000
<21-1,SPENCER>我只是闹着玩而已
<21-1,SPENCER>It was just to screw around.

631
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,300
<21-2,BECKETT>你说的闹着玩  就是明明知道
<21-2,BECKETT>If by "screwing around" you mean intentionally putting

632
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,680
<21-2,BECKETT>麦克斯会向唐尼开枪
<21-2,BECKETT>A bullet in a chamber knowing that

633
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,600
<21-2,BECKETT>还把子弹放进枪膛
<21-2,BECKETT>Max was gonna shoot Donny,

634
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,800
<21-2,BECKETT>那就对了  我们意见一致
<21-2,BECKETT>Then yes! You and I are in totally agreement!

635
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,930
<21-2,BECKETT>贝克特探长
<21-2,BECKETT>Detective Beckett

636
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,200
<21-3,BECKETT>如果这个游戏的规则是  不用子弹开枪
<21-3,BECKETT>If the point of the game was to shoot without bullets,

637
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,720
<21-3,BECKETT>那你怎么会有子弹
<21-3,BECKETT>Then why would you have bullets

638
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,800
<21-3,BECKETT>除非你是故意的
<21-3,BECKETT>Unless you intended to use'em?

639
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,880
<21-3,BECKETT>我过告诉你
<21-3,BECKETT>I told you, I didn't know

640
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,500
<21-4,SPENCER>我不知道枪里有子弹
<21-4,SPENCER>There were any bullets in the gun.

641
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,900
<21-5,BECKETT>有人知道  而他就是杀麦克斯的凶手
<21-5,BECKETT>Well, somebody did, and I think whoever it is killed Max.

642
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,300
<21-5,BECKETT>你的枪  你的子弹
<21-5,BECKETT>Your gun, your bullets-

643
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,700
<21-5,BECKETT>从我的立场看  斯宾塞  你就是凶手
<21-5,BECKETT>From where I'm standing, Spencer, you did it.

644
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,600
<21-5,BECKETT>昨晚6点30分到9点之间你在哪儿
<21-5,BECKETT>So where were you between 6:30 and 9:00 last night?

645
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,000
<21-6,SPENCER>在我父亲的俱乐部
<21-6,SPENCER>Uh... At- at my dad's club.

646
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,700
<21-6,SPENCER>世纪俱乐部  和布兰登在一起
<21-6,SPENCER>The Century. With Brandon.

647
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,100
<21-7,BECKETT>你最好希望布兰登  能给你作证
<21-7,BECKETT>You better hope that Brandon corroborates that.

648
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,900
<21-7,BECKETT>我知道罗米和斯宾塞全都告诉你们了
<21-7,BECKETT>Look, I know Romy and Spencer told you guys everything,

649
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,500
<21-7,BECKETT>我们都有了麻烦
<21-7,BECKETT>And that we're all in big trouble...

650
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,900
<21-7,BECKETT>但是我很高兴
<21-7,BECKETT>But I'm glad.

651
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,030
<21-7,BECKETT>你很高兴
<21-7,BECKETT>You're glad?

652
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,500
<22-1,BECKETT>在意外发生之后
<22-1,BECKETT>We should have just come clean with you guys

653
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
<22-1,BECKETT>-我们就应该跟你们说清楚  -确实如此
<22-1,BECKETT>- After the accident. - You're damn right you should've.

654
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,200
<22-2,BRANDON>我知道  但我们不想给麦克斯带来麻烦
<22-2,BRANDON>I know. But we didn't want to screw Max over.

655
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,900
<22-3,CASTLE>这就是你们诬陷毒贩的原因  对吗
<22-3,CASTLE>That's why you fingered the drug dealer, right?

656
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,800
<22-3,CASTLE>他是可以牺牲的
<22-3,CASTLE>'Cause he's expendable.

657
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,500
<22-4,BRANDON>我告诉罗米这样不对  但她想保护麦克斯
<22-4,BRANDON>I told Romy that was wrong, but she wanted to protect Max.

658
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,430
<22-4,BRANDON>那个毒贩就是
<22-4,BRANDON>And that junkie's the one

659
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,300
<22-4,BRANDON>把唐尼拉进毒品交易的人
<22-4,BRANDON>Who got Donny into dealing in the first place.

660
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,800
<22-5,CASTLE>麦克斯被害的时候你在哪儿
<22-5,CASTLE>So where were you when Max was killed?

661
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,600
<22-6,BRANDON>和斯宾塞在他父亲的俱乐部
<22-6,BRANDON>With Spencer at his dad's club.

662
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,400
<22-6,BRANDON>问他  他能证明
<22-6,BRANDON>Ask him, he’ll confirm it.

663
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,500
<22-7,BECKETT>你们总是很坦白  是吗
<22-7,BECKETT>You guys always have your stories straight, don’t you?

664
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,700
<22-7,BECKETT>我们不在公园  那个毒贩是凶手
<22-7,BECKETT>"We weren't at the park. It was the drug dealer.

665
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,300
<22-7,BECKETT>是麦克斯  你们总是异口同声
<22-7,BECKETT>It was Max. " You guys are always in sync.

666
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,800
<22-7,BECKETT>所以  我不相信你们
<22-7,BECKETT>Maybe that's why I don't believe you.

667
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
<22-8,BRANDON>你可以不相信我
<22-8,BRANDON>You don't have to believe me.

668
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,200
<22-8,BRANDON>可是我有证据
<22-8,BRANDON>I have proof.

669
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,300
<22-8,BRANDON>知道吗  我们有视频
<22-8,BRANDON>We'd take these videos, you know,

670
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,000
<22-8,BRANDON>只是因为好玩  做疯狂的事情
<22-8,BRANDON>I mean, just for laughs, doing crazy stuff.

671
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,300
<22-8,BRANDON>罗米的父亲李先生是个电脑高手
<22-8,BRANDON>Romy's dad Mr. Lee is like this big I.T. Guy,

672
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
<22-8,BRANDON>他用蓝牙让我们的文件共享
<22-8,BRANDON>And he hooked us up with a file share over bluetooth.

673
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,510
<22-8,BRANDON>这样大家都有这些文件了
<22-8,BRANDON>That way we'd all get the files.

674
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,700
<22-8,BRANDON>阿曼达那晚拍的
<22-8,BRANDON>Amanda shot this that night.

675
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,420
<22-9,BECKETT>什么内容
<22-9,BECKETT>What is it?

676
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,300
<22-9,BECKETT>这个视频
<22-9,BECKETT>A video...

677
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,600
<22-10,BRANDON>是唐尼遭枪击的情况
<22-10,BRANDON>Of Donny getting shot.

678
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,200
<22-10,BRANDON>我们本应该删除的
<22-10,BRANDON>We were all supposed to erase it.

679
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,500
<22-10,BRANDON>但我知道如果真相大白
<22-10,BRANDON>But I knew that if the truth came out,

680
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,700
<22-10,BRANDON>我们就都有麻烦了
<22-10,BRANDON>We'd all be screwed.

681
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,500
<22-10,BRANDON>在杜克大学的强奸案里就是这样
<22-10,BRANDON>And after what happened to those kids in that Duke case,

682
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,400
<22-10,BRANDON>我只是
<22-10,BRANDON>I just...

683
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
<22-10,BRANDON>不想有那样一个结局
<22-10,BRANDON>I didn't want to end up like that.

684
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,000
<22-10,BRANDON>给你
<22-10,BRANDON>Here.

685

<22-10,BRANDON>喝光它  布兰
<22-10,BRANDON>Oh, yeah, suck it down, Bran.

686
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,500
<22-10,BRANDON>喝光  喝光  你真差劲
<22-10,BRANDON>Suck it! Suck it! You suck.

687
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,900
<22-10,BRANDON>小布兰登尿裤子了
<22-10,BRANDON>Little Brandon wet himself!

688
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,300
<22-10,BRANDON>太棒了  又被耍了  妈妈
<22-10,BRANDON>Oh, great. "Punk'd" is back. Hi, mom!

<22-10,BRANDON>All right, let's do this, baby!

690
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
<22-10,BRANDON>你拉着我妈的海瑞·温斯顿(珠宝品牌)手镯
<22-10,BRANDON>Hey, you pulled my mom's Harry Winston tennis bracelet.

691
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,900
<22-10,BRANDON>-你偷的吧  -借的
<22-10,BRANDON>- That you stole. - Borrowed.

692
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,600
<22-10,BRANDON>这手镯顶我们全家的家当了
<22-10,BRANDON>That's worth my entire family.

693
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,500
<22-10,BRANDON>快来  伙计们  我的胳膊好累
<22-10,BRANDON>Come on, guys. My arm's getting tired.

694
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,300
<22-10,BRANDON>-我们开始吧  -开始喽
<22-10,BRANDON>- Let's do this! - Okay, here we go.

695
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,900
<22-10,BRANDON>好吧  好吧
<22-10,BRANDON>All right, all right.

696
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,800
<22-10,BRANDON>再见  安德森先生
<22-10,BRANDON>Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

697
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,300
<22-10,BRANDON>天哪
<22-10,BRANDON>Oh, my god!

698
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,900
<22-10,BRANDON>你没事吧
<22-10,BRANDON>You okay?

699
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,600
<23-1,CASTLE>我在想唐尼的父母
<23-1,CASTLE>I was just thinking about Donny's parents,

700
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,700
<23-1,CASTLE>看到这个视频怎么受得了
<23-1,CASTLE>What they'll go through when they watch that video.

701
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
<23-1,CASTLE>我猜这种情况不多
<23-1,CASTLE>Guess it's not too often

702
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,300
<23-1,CASTLE>从录像带里抓住凶手
<23-1,CASTLE>You get a murder caught on tape, huh?

703
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,600
<23-2,BECKETT>他很聪明没删掉
<23-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he was smart to keep it.

704
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,800
<23-2,BECKETT>否则  他们都将面临谋杀的指控
<23-2,BECKETT>Otherwise they'd all be facing a manslaughter charge.

705
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,500
<23-3,CASTLE>是啊  很聪明
<23-3,CASTLE>Yeah... That was pretty smart

706
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,200
<23-3,CASTLE>当你想到这点的时候  对不对
<23-3,CASTLE>When you think about it, wasn't it?

707
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
<23-4,BECKETT>-我明白你的意思  卡塞尔  -我只是说
<23-4,BECKETT>- I know that tone, Castle. - I'm just saying,

708
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,140
<23-5,CASTLE>他们很幸运
<23-5,CASTLE>It's pretty lucky

709
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,500
<23-5,CASTLE>拍下了那晚的聚会
<23-5,CASTLE>They filmed their little game that night.

710
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,700
<23-6,BECKETT>人们在视频网站发布疯狂的事情
<23-6,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, people post crazy stuff on You Tube.

711
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,200
<23-7,CASTLE>刚开始拍的几次  很激动
<23-7,CASTLE>I get filming it the first few times. It's exciting.

712
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
<23-7,CASTLE>但是第10次  第15次呢
<23-7,CASTLE>But the 10th? The 15th?

713
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,950
<23-7,CASTLE>那个晚上有什么特别的呢
<23-7,CASTLE>What was so special about that night?

714
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,850
<23-8,BECKETT>唐尼中枪了
<23-8,BECKETT>Donny got shot.

715
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,560
<23-9,CASTLE>所以录像的唯一理由就是
<23-9,CASTLE>So the only reason to film it is...

716
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,550
<23-10,BECKETT>你知道要发生什么事
<23-10,BECKETT>You knew something was gonna happen.

717
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,280
<23-10,BECKETT>什么时候  谢谢你  肯德尔先生
<23-10,BECKETT>And that was when? Okay, thank you, Mrs. Kendall.

718
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,450
<23-10,BECKETT>得到消息
<23-10,BECKETT>Get this

719
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,150
<23-10,BECKETT>直到上个月唐尼和阿曼达一直谈恋爱
<23-10,BECKETT>Donny and were dating until about a month ago.

720
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,950
<24-1,CASTLE>唐尼和她分手了
<24-1,CASTLE>When Donny broke it off?

721
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,000
<24-1,CASTLE>今天没上学  阿曼达
<24-1,CASTLE>You weren't in school today, Amanda.

722
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,320
<25-1,AMANDA>怎么了  我对上学没兴趣
<25-1,AMANDA>So? I wasn't up for it.

723
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,890
<25-2,CASTLE>说谎会令人精疲力尽的
<25-2,CASTLE>Yes. Lying can be so exhausting.

724
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,350
<25-3,AMANDA>-又不是你们失去了朋友  -我们看到视频了
<25-3,AMANDA>- So can losing two of your friends. - We saw the video.

725
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,950
<25-5,AMANDA>布兰登告诉我了  你们都知道了
<25-5,AMANDA>Brandon told me. So now you know everything.

726
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,530
<25-6,CASTLE>那天晚上你们为什么录像
<25-6,CASTLE>Why did you shoot the video that night?

727
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,430
<25-7,AMANDA>我不知道  我们经常这样做
<25-7,AMANDA>I don't know. We did lots of times.

728
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,050
<25-8,CASTLE>那晚的上一次是什么时候
<25-8,CASTLE>When was the last time before that night?

729
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,300
<25-9,AMANDA>我不记得了
<25-9,AMANDA>I don't remember.

730
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,560
<25-9,AMANDA>你们不是说  你们什么都看见了吗
<25-9,AMANDA>Look, I thought you said you saw what happened.

731
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,500
<25-10,CASTLE>不错  可是为什么我们能看到
<25-10,CASTLE>We did. We're just not sure why we saw what happened.

732
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,440
<25-11,BECKETT>你们决定当晚录像
<25-11,BECKETT>Your decision to make a video that night

733
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,750
<25-11,BECKETT>这事解释不通
<25-11,BECKETT>doesn't make any sense

734
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,750
<25-11,BECKETT>除非你知道将要发生什么
<25-11,BECKETT>Unless you knew something was gonna happen.

735
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,450
<25-12,AMANDA>你说我知道吗  那完全是个意外
<25-12,AMANDA>You think I knew? It was totally an accident!

736
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,350
<25-12,AMANDA>我根本不可能会知道
<25-12,AMANDA>There's no way I could have known

737
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,730
<25-12,AMANDA>唐尼会中枪
<25-12,AMANDA>Donny was gonna get shot.

738
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,150
<25-13,BECKETT>当然可能
<25-13,BECKETT>Sure there is,

739
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,180
<25-13,BECKETT>如果是你在枪里放了子弹
<25-13,BECKETT>If you're the one who put a bullet in the gun.

740
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,480
<25-15,CASTLE>-什么  -我们和唐尼的父母谈过了
<25-15,CASTLE>- What? - We spoke to Donny's parents.

741
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,780
<25-15,CASTLE>你们曾经恋爱
<25-15,CASTLE>We know you two were dating.

742
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,550
<25-16,BECKETT>而且在一个月之前唐尼和你分手了
<25-16,BECKETT>We also know Donny broke up with you about a month ago.

743
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,210
<25-17,AMANDA>-天啊  -这就是你的动机  阿曼达
<25-17,AMANDA>- Oh, my god. - It gives you motive, Amanda.

744
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,250
<25-18,BECKETT>事情不是这样的
<25-18,BECKETT>It's not what happened!

745
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,250
<25-19,AMANDA>对  唐尼和我分手了
<25-19,AMANDA>Yes, Donny broke up with me,

746
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,650
<25-19,AMANDA>那只是因为他发现我和布兰登在一起
<25-19,AMANDA>But only because he found out I hooked up with Brandon.

747
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,850
<25-20,BECKETT>布兰登
<25-20,BECKETT>Brandon?

748
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,510
<25-21,AMANDA>都是因为他的家里
<25-21,AMANDA>Everything with his family...

749
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,150
<25-21,AMANDA>唐尼退出了
<25-21,AMANDA>Donny checked out.

750
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,150
<25-21,AMANDA>唐尼不在身边了  但是布兰登在
<25-21,AMANDA>He wasn't there for me, and Brandon was.

751
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,250
<25-22,CASTLE>我相信
<25-22,CASTLE>I bet he was.

752
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,950
<25-23,AMANDA>不是那样的  布兰登真是个好人
<25-23,AMANDA>It's not like that. Brandon's a really good guy.

753
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,650
<25-24,CASTLE>他是好人  还会留着那仅有的视频
<25-24,CASTLE>A good guy who kept the only copy of a video

754
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,050
<25-24,CASTLE>而且他说是你录的
<25-24,CASTLE>He told us you shot.

755
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,250
<25-25,AMANDA>如果他留着视频  自然有原因
<25-25,AMANDA>If Brandon kept the video, he had his reasons.

756
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,550
<25-26,CASTLE>当晚是布兰登让你录像的  对吗
<25-26,CASTLE>Brandon told you to shoot the video that night, didn't he?

757
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,050
<25-26,CASTLE>对
<25-26,CASTLE>Yeah.

758
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,050
<25-26,CASTLE>知道谁改口供了吗
<25-26,CASTLE>Guess who just changed his story?

759
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,550
<26-1,BECKETT>你哥们儿  斯宾塞
<26-1,BECKETT>Your buddy Spencer.

760
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,550
<26-2,CASTLE>他不能提供麦克斯死亡时  你的不在场证明
<26-2,CASTLE>Your comrade just gave up your alibi for Max's murder.

761
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,650
<26-2,CASTLE>你说麦克斯是自杀的  对吗
<26-2,CASTLE>You mean Max's suicide, don't you?

762
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,020
<26-3,BRANDON>而且我认为
<26-3,BRANDON>And last I checked,

763
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,850
<26-3,BRANDON>我不需要不在场证明  不是吗
<26-3,BRANDON>I wouldn't need an alibi for that, would I?

764
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,150
<26-4,BECKETT>法医鉴定
<26-4,BECKETT>The medical examiner concluded

765
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,750
<26-4,BECKETT>麦克斯是被谋杀的
<26-4,BECKETT>That Max's death was a homicide.

766
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,750
<26-5,BRANDON>我相信我们能雇到很多的专家
<26-5,BRANDON>Oh. Well, I'm sure there are any number of experts

767
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,450
<26-5,BRANDON>为我辩护
<26-5,BRANDON>We can hire who will disagree with a city employee.

768
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,050
<26-6,CASTLE>专家为你辩护  不在作案现场
<26-6,CASTLE>Expert witnesses? Scrambling for alibis?

769
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,350
<26-6,CASTLE>你好像已经准备好辩护了
<26-6,CASTLE>Sounds like you're already building a defense.

770
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,250
<26-7,BRANDON>你们不是一直
<26-7,BRANDON>You guys have been running around

771
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,250
<26-7,BRANDON>在我们中找谋杀凶手吗
<26-7,BRANDON>Accusing everyone of murder.

772
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,050
<26-7,BRANDON>我想该轮到我了  所以我最好有所准备
<26-7,BRANDON>I figured my turn was coming, and I'd better be ready.

773
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,550
<26-8,CASTLE>只是现在  我们知道你是凶手
<26-8,CASTLE>Only now we know it was you.

774
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,650
<26-8,CASTLE>麦克斯遇害那晚
<26-8,CASTLE>All three of your friends have solid alibis

775
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,550
<26-8,CASTLE>你的那三个朋友都有不在场证明
<26-8,CASTLE>For the night Max was killed.

776
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,550
<26-9,BRANDON>你说他是被杀  我说他是自杀
<26-9,BRANDON>You say killed, I say suicide.

777
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,950
<26-10,BECKETT>-那晚你在哪儿  -我去散步了
<26-10,BECKETT>- Where were you that night? - I took a walk.

778
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,050
<26-11,BRANDON>我知道你们不会相信
<26-11,BRANDON>I knew you guys wouldn't believe me,

779
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,750
<26-11,BRANDON>所以找斯宾塞打掩护
<26-11,BRANDON>So I asked Spencer to cover for me.

780
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,150
<26-12,BECKETT>你们总是互相打掩护  是吗
<26-12,BECKETT>That's what you guys do, right, cover for each other?

781
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,100
<26-13,BRANDON>没错  探长
<26-13,BRANDON>Exactly. Look, detective,

782
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,750
<26-13,BRANDON>你对每件事都感兴趣
<26-13,BRANDON>You're hot in everything,

783
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,050
<26-13,BRANDON>但如果你们有了确切的证据
<26-13,BRANDON>But if you had any actual evidence,

784
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,450
<26-13,BRANDON>早已经把我抓了
<26-13,BRANDON>You'd have already arrested me.

785
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,050
<26-13,BRANDON>我有视频能够证明麦克斯杀了唐尼
<26-13,BRANDON>Me? I have a video that proves Max killed Donny.

786
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,150
<26-13,BRANDON>你们真的认为陪审团会相信
<26-13,BRANDON>Do you really think a jury's gonna believe

787
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,050
<27-3,CASTLE>他没有喝醉  然后自杀吗
<27-3,CASTLE>He didn't get drunk and off himself?

788
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,550
<26-14,BECKETT>对你这只不过是个游戏  不是吗
<26-14,BECKETT>This is just a game for you, isn’t it?

789
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,850
<26-14,BECKETT>就像在公园里卖毒品
<26-14,BECKETT>Like selling drugs in the park.

790
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,550
<26-15,BRANDON>好吧  如果是  那我就赢了
<26-15,BRANDON>Well, if it was, looks like I'd be winning.

791
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,750
<26-15,BRANDON>不过  如果你认为我是凶手
<26-15,BRANDON>But hey, if you think I did it...

792
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,150
<26-15,BRANDON>就拿出证据来
<26-15,BRANDON>Let's see you prove it.

793
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,650
<26-16,CASTLE>我讨厌这孩子
<26-16,CASTLE>I hate that kid.

794
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,850
<27-1,CASTLE>你知道的  寻找证据真的很枯燥
<27-1,CASTLE>You know, actually having to prove things is really tedious.

795
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,650
<27-2,BECKETT>-欢迎加入我的世界  -布兰登策划了一切
<27-2,BECKETT>- Welcome to my world. - Brandon had this all planned.

796
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,350
<27-3,CASTLE>他借麦克斯之手杀死唐尼
<27-3,CASTLE>He gets Max to shoot Donny

797
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,460
<27-3,CASTLE>然后将麦克斯灌醉  杀了他
<27-3,CASTLE>Then gets Max drunk and kills him.

798
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,770
<27-4,BECKETT>世上没有完美的罪案  卡塞尔
<27-4,BECKETT>There's no such thing as a perfect crime, Castle.

799
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,350
<27-5,CASTLE>暂时没有  有一天我会写出完美的罪案
<27-5,CASTLE>Not yet. But one day I'm gonna write it.

800
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,850
<27-6,RYAN>从72街公园入口到案发现场的
<27-6,RYAN>Okay, we canvassed every store, stand and homeless guy

801
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,050
<27-6,RYAN>商店摊位和流浪汉  我们全问过了
<27-6,RYAN>From the park's entrance at 72nd to the scene.

802
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,050
<27-7,ESPOSITO>那晚没人见过麦克斯或布兰登
<27-7,ESPOSITO>And no one remembers seeing Max or Brandon last night.

803
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,250
<27-8,BECKETT>如果不能证明布兰登在作案现场
<27-8,BECKETT>If we can't put Brandon at Max's murder scene,

804
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,950
<27-8,BECKETT>那么检察官无法进一步行动
<27-8,BECKETT>Then the D.A. Will never move.

805
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,850
<27-9,CASTLE>那些孩子们互相传阅视频
<27-9,CASTLE>These kids were hooked on video sharing.

806
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,750
<27-9,CASTLE>一定有问题
<27-9,CASTLE>There has to be something.

807
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,650
<27-10,RYAN>我已经查过所有有关的视频  音频
<27-10,RYAN>Eh, I already scrolled through every video, audio,

808
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,450
<27-10,RYAN>照片和短信
<27-10,RYAN>Photo and text file in that thing.

809
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,330
<27-11,ESPOSITO>还是不够走运
<27-11,ESPOSITO>Guess we weren't lucky enough

810
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,650
<27-11,ESPOSITO>麦克斯没录下自己被布兰登谋害
<27-11,ESPOSITO>To have Max take video of Brandon killing him.

811
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,350
<27-12,CASTLE>有趣的是  如果他录了  布兰登会知道
<27-12,CASTLE>Funny thing is, if he did, Brandon would have known.

812
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,150
<27-12,CASTLE>那个文件会出现
<27-12,CASTLE>It would have popped up

813
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,330
<27-12,CASTLE>在他手机的共享文件中  只要他们的手机
<27-12,CASTLE>In his shared folder as soon as their phones...

814
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,350
<27-12,CASTLE>同步
<27-12,CASTLE>Synced.

815
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,350
<27-13,BECKETT>谢谢
<27-13,BECKETT>Thank you.

816
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,650
<27-14,CASTLE>同步
<27-14,CASTLE>Synced.

817
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,150
<27-15,BECKETT>麦克斯被杀时如果他们在一起
<27-15,BECKETT>If they were together when Max was murdered,

818
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,950
<27-15,BECKETT>那么他们的手机会自动同步
<27-15,BECKETT>Then their phones would have automatically synced.

819
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,850
<27-15,BECKETT>应该会有记录
<27-15,BECKETT>There'd be a record.

820
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,450
<28-1,BECKETT>你现在有权找位律师  布兰登
<28-1,BECKETT>You have the right to have a lawyer present, Brandon.

821
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,050
<28-1,BECKETT>如果你请不起  我们可以帮你安排
<28-1,BECKETT>If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.

822
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,830
<28-2,CASTLE>他请得起身价百万的律师
<28-2,CASTLE>Oh, he could afford a million lawyers.

823
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,630
<28-3,BRANDON>-但她还是得告知我的权利  对吗  -对
<28-3,BRANDON>- But she still has to advise me of my rights, right? - Right.

824
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,950
<28-4,BECKETT>算了吧  我不需要律师
<28-4,BECKETT>Anyway, that's cool. I don't want a lawyer.

825
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,750
<28-5,BRANDON>这样会更有趣儿
<28-5,BRANDON>This is way more fun.

826
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,650
<28-6,BECKETT>那你就直接在这儿签字吧
<28-6,BECKETT>Maybe you'd like to just sign a confession, then?

827
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,650
<28-6,BECKETT>可以
<28-6,BECKETT>Sure.

828
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,750
<28-7,BRANDON>我承认
<28-7,BRANDON>I confess...

829
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,550
<28-7,BRANDON>对你上衣的里面很感兴趣
<28-7,BRANDON>That I'm dying to cop a feel under your cop blouse.

830
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,750
<28-7,BRANDON>就这样
<28-7,BRANDON>There.

831
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,250
<28-7,BRANDON>现在我感觉超好
<28-7,BRANDON>Now I feel so much better.

832
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,450
<28-8,CASTLE>你不想打电话吗
<28-8,CASTLE>You sure you don't want to call somebody-

833
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,950
<28-8,CASTLE>给你的父母
<28-8,CASTLE>Your parents maybe?

834
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,950
<28-9,BRANDON>我为什么要让他们担心
<28-9,BRANDON>Why would I worry them?

835
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,950
<28-10,CASTLE>刚才给我的赌注经纪打了个电话
<28-10,CASTLE>You know, I made a call just a little while ago to my bookie.

836
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,850
<28-11,BRANDON>好啊
<28-11,BRANDON>Sweet.

837
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,180
<28-12,CASTLE>我站在诺布(著名日式餐厅)外的大街上
<28-12,CASTLE>I was standing in the street outside Nobu

838
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,950
<28-12,CASTLE>等我的车
<28-12,CASTLE>Waiting for my car.

839
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,180
<28-13,BRANDON>我很喜欢那里
<28-13,BRANDON>Oh, yeah? I love that place.

840
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,180
<28-14,CASTLE>那里的鱿鱼意粉非常好
<28-14,CASTLE>The black squid pasta is amazing.

841
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,000
<28-14,CASTLE>服务生停车的时候
<28-14,CASTLE>Anyway, I was talking on the phone

842
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,950
<28-14,CASTLE>我一直在打电话
<28-14,CASTLE>When the valet pulled up with my car.

843
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,260
<28-14,CASTLE>突然  我的电话断了
<28-14,CASTLE>And all of a sudden, my call got cut off.

844
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,150
<28-14,CASTLE>这才想起  车里的蓝牙耳机
<28-14,CASTLE>And I realized- oh, the bluetooth in my car

845
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,750
<28-14,CASTLE>自动转接了电话  因为它们是连着的
<28-14,CASTLE>Picked up the call automatically because they were linked.

846
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,000
<28-15,BECKETT>你曾说过  你们的手机自动共享媒体文件
<28-15,BECKETT>You told us that all your phones autoshare media files

847
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,550
<28-15,BECKETT>-通过蓝牙连接  对吗  -怎么了
<28-15,BECKETT>- Via a bluetooth link, right? - So?

848
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,250
<28-17,CASTLE>所以在麦克斯被杀那晚
<28-17,CASTLE>So your phone linked with Max's phone

849
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,750
<28-17,CASTLE>你们俩的手机是连着的
<28-17,CASTLE>The night he was killed.

850
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,350
<28-18,BECKETT>这个数字指纹指出
<28-18,BECKETT>It's a digital fingerprint that places you

851
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,050
<28-18,BECKETT>麦克斯被杀时  你在离他6米的范围内
<28-18,BECKETT>Within 20 feet of Max at the time of his murder.

852
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,350
<28-19,CASTLE>你说过  如果她找到确实的证据
<28-19,CASTLE>You did say if she got some actual evidence,

853
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,460
<28-19,CASTLE>她应该逮捕你
<28-19,CASTLE>She should arrest you.

854
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,120
<28-20,BECKETT>你利用了麦克斯杀死唐尼的内疚感
<28-20,BECKETT>You took advantage of Max's guilt over Donny's death,

855
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,250
<28-20,BECKETT>然后灌醉了他
<28-20,BECKETT>And you got him blackout drunk,

856
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,950
<28-20,BECKETT>把枪放在他手里
<28-20,BECKETT>And then you put a gun in his hand,

857
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,730
<28-20,BECKETT>对准他的太阳穴
<28-20,BECKETT>Pressed it against his temple,

858
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,160
<28-20,BECKETT>扣动扳机
<28-20,BECKETT>And then you pulled the trigger.

859
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,550
<28-21,BRANDON>我为什么要这样做
<28-21,BRANDON>Why would I do that?

860
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,550
<28-22,BECKETT>用来掩饰唐尼是你杀的
<28-22,BECKETT>To cover your tracks over killing Donny.

861
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,850
<28-23,BRANDON>我为什么要杀唐尼
<28-23,BRANDON>Why would I kill Donny?

862
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,950
<28-24,CASTLE>阿曼达
<28-24,CASTLE>Amanda.

863
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,350
<28-25,BRANDON>阿曼达是我的  不是唐尼的
<28-25,BRANDON>Amanda is with me, not Donny.

864
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,950
<28-26,CASTLE>对  在唐尼家破产之后
<28-26,CASTLE>Yeah, only after Donny lost all his money.

865
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,750
<28-27,BECKETT>这让你感到有点失落吧
<28-27,BECKETT>Which makes you sloppy seconds.

867
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,150
<28-28,CASTLE>尤其是他得到的
<28-28,CASTLE>Especially 'cause he got way more

868
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,350
<28-29,BECKETT>不仅是上衣里面的
<28-29,BECKETT>Than just under her blouse, right?

869
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:29,550
<28-30,BRANDON>我有视频证明唐尼是麦克斯杀的
<28-30,BRANDON>I have that video that shows that Max killed Donny,

870
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,550
<28-30,BRANDON>我不是凶手
<28-30,BRANDON>Not me.

871
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,250
<28-31,CASTLE>你的安排  非常令人佩服
<28-31,CASTLE>And arranging that was very impressive.

872
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,680
<28-31,CASTLE>骗骗斯宾塞  罗米和阿曼达不是困难
<28-31,CASTLE>Fooling Spencer, Romy and Amanda wasn't that hard.

873
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,650
<28-31,CASTLE>因为他们不拿枪  不过麦克斯就不一样了
<28-31,CASTLE>They didn't handle the gun. But Max was another story.

874
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,250
<28-31,CASTLE>他的确扣动了扳机
<28-31,CASTLE>He actually pulled the trigger,

875
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,650
<28-31,CASTLE>他就是放不下  是不是
<28-31,CASTLE>And he just couldn't let it go, could he?

876
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,150
<28-31,CASTLE>后来他记起  是你给他的枪
<28-31,CASTLE>And then he remembered, you gave him the gun.

877
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,250
<28-31,CASTLE>所以他打电话给你  约你见面
<28-31,CASTLE>So he called you and asked to meet you.

878
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,850
<28-32,BECKETT>我们有通话记录
<28-32,BECKETT>We have a record of the call.

879
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,450
<28-32,BECKETT>你知道接下来会发生什么
<28-32,BECKETT>You knew something was up,

880
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,450
<28-32,BECKETT>所以你带着枪和什么呢  伏特加酒
<28-32,BECKETT>So you brought the gun and, what, vodka?

881
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,050
<28-33,CASTLE>或者麦克斯喜欢威士忌
<28-33,CASTLE>Or was Max a scotch guy?

882
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,950
<28-33,CASTLE>他知道你  阿曼达  和唐尼的事情
<28-33,CASTLE>He knew all about you, Donny and Amanda.

883
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,650
<28-33,CASTLE>他想到  是不是你设计圈套
<28-33,CASTLE>He had to wonder," did you set me up

884
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,150
<28-33,CASTLE>害我杀死了我最好的朋友
<28-33,CASTLE>To kill my best friend?"

885
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,950
<28-33,CASTLE>当他意识到是你
<28-33,CASTLE>And when he realized you had,

886
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,250
<28-33,CASTLE>他将不会保持沉默  是不是
<28-33,CASTLE>He wasn't gonna keep it quiet, was he?

887
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,350
<28-33,CASTLE>即使你告诉他  你们都将进监狱
<28-33,CASTLE>Even with you telling him, " you'd all go to jail."

888
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,850
<28-33,CASTLE>如果麦克斯足够强硬
<28-33,CASTLE>If only Max had been strong enough just to man up...

889
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,850
<28-26,CASTLE>如果唐尼能意识到
<28-26,CASTLE>If only Donny realized

890
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:28,350
<28-32,BECKETT>他和你们再没什么关系了
<28-32,BECKETT>He didn't belong with you guys anymore,

891
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,850
<28-33,CASTLE>他和阿曼达已经分手了  那么这一切
<28-33,CASTLE>He and Amanda were through, well, then none of this

892
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,850
<28-33,CASTLE>都没必要发生了
<28-33,CASTLE>Would have been necessary.

893
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,180
<28-33,CASTLE>弱者往往想不到的
<28-33,CASTLE>Weak people just don't get it,

894
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,870
<28-34,BRANDON>不是吗  布兰登
<28-34,BRANDON>Do they, Brandon?

895
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,550
<28-34,BRANDON>有时他们不得不被人领着  认识真相
<28-34,BRANDON>Sometimes they just have to be led to the truth.

896
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,450
<28-34,BRANDON>没错
<28-34,BRANDON>Exactly.

897
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,250
<28-35,CASTLE>他说的是  没错
<28-35,CASTLE>Did he just say "exactly"?

<28-38,BECKETT>这个叫做  不利于己的供认
<28-38,BECKETT>It's called "admission against interest."

902
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,950
<28-39,CASTLE>这个术语用在招供里真棒
<28-39,CASTLE>It's just a fancy term for a confession.

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,450
<28-40,BECKETT>很管用啊
<28-40,BECKETT>Pretty sweet, huh?

906
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,050

00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,350
<28-43,CASTLE>如果你没这么做  我们就错过真相了
<28-43,CASTLE>Is we would have never figured it out if you hadn't.

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,450
<28-45,CASTLE>我肯定可以的
