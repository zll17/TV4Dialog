22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,140
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>脏弹不在卡车里
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>The bomb was not in the truck.

23
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,300
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>不  长官  不在里面
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>No, sir. That's negative.

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,220
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>脏弹不在卡车里面
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>The bomb was not in the truck.

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,380
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>辐射小组正在检测
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>We have rad crews on the ground now.

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,520
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>是的  长官  我会与你保持联系
<1-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Yes, sir. I'll keep you apprised.

27
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,170
<1-2,MONTGOMERY>将搜查范围扩至三个街区
<1-2,MONTGOMERY>Keep the perimeter at a 3-block radius.

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,610
<1-2,MONTGOMERY>让那些媒体滚远点
<1-2,MONTGOMERY>And keep the press the hell outta here.

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,160
<1-2,MONTGOMERY>我们不能引起恐慌
<1-2,MONTGOMERY>We don't need a panic on our hands, all right?

30
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,110
<1-3,UNIFORM>长官  辐射小组已经完成了
<1-3,UNIFORM>Sir, radiation teams have finished sweeping

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,340
<1-3,UNIFORM>附近地区的扫描  没有脏弹存在的痕迹
<1-3,UNIFORM>the immediate area-- negative across the board.

32
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,440
<1-3,UNIFORM>如果他们移动了炸弹  一定不再附近
<1-3,UNIFORM>If they moved the device, it's not nearby.

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,080
<1-4,MONTGOMERY>没道理啊
<1-4,MONTGOMERY>It makes no sense.

34
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,210
<1-4,MONTGOMERY>-他们为什么要移走  -它是牛仔小丑
<1-4,MONTGOMERY>- Why would they move it? - It's a rodeo clown.

35
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,430
<1-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>-牛仔小丑吗  -卡车只是为了虚晃一枪
<1-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>- Rodeo clown? - The truck...it's a diversion.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,450
<1-6,MONTGOMERY>杰马尔一定感觉到我们逼近了
<1-6,MONTGOMERY>Jamal must have sensed we were closing in.

37
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,730
<1-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>他给我们一个诱饵  让我们远离真正的目标
<1-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>He gave us something to chase, throw us off the target.

38
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,990
<1-8,MONTGOMERY>-他在耍我们  -也就是说我们又回到起点了
<1-8,MONTGOMERY>- He's playing us. - So we're back to square one?

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,800
<1-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们得找到杰马尔  在他们的雇员上多下功夫
<1-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>We gotta find Jamal. Move in on his employees.

40
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,940
<1-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>调查整个公司
<1-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Shake the trees.

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,730
<1-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>肯定有人知道内幕
<1-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Somebody's gotta know something.

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,170
<2-1,CASTLE>你觉得法伦知不知道自己在追查的是个死人
<2-1,CASTLE>You think Fallon knows he's chasing a dead man?

43
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,920
<2-2,BECKETT>不知道  他只有在我们出去之后才会知道
<2-2,BECKETT>No. And he won't know unless we get out of here.

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,090
<2-3,CASTLE>你觉得他们会回来吗
<2-3,CASTLE>Think they're coming back?

45
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,500
<2-4,BECKETT>他们干嘛要回来
<2-4,BECKETT>Why would they?

46
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,710
<2-5,CASTLE>为了杰马尔
<2-5,CASTLE>For Jamal.

47
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,720
<2-5,CASTLE>不然他们干嘛把他的尸体放在冰柜里
<2-5,CASTLE>Why else would they keep his body on ice?

48
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,340
<2-5,CASTLE>这件事的主谋
<2-5,CASTLE>Whoever's behind this

49
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,010
<2-5,CASTLE>因为某种原因才把杰马尔的尸体冷藏起来
<2-5,CASTLE>wanted to preserve his body for some reason.

50
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,520
<2-5,CASTLE>我是这样想的
<2-5,CASTLE>I'm thinking...

51
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,870
<2-5,CASTLE>他们想把尸体和脏弹一起放到面包车里
<2-5,CASTLE>they wanted his body in that van with the bomb.

52
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,260
<2-5,CASTLE>那样的话  当脏弹爆炸的时候
<2-5,CASTLE>That way, when the bomb goes off...

53
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,640
<2-6,BECKETT>会使得他的尸首和DNA留在案发现场
<2-6,BECKETT>They'd have his remains and his D.N.A. at the crime scene.

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,360
<2-6,BECKETT>-人们就会认为他是恐怖分子  -没错
<2-6,BECKETT>- People would think that he was the terrorist. - Right.

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,710
<2-7,CASTLE>然后真正的恐怖分子就会逍遥法外
<2-7,CASTLE>And then the real terrorists would get away scot-free.

56
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,640
<2-8,BECKETT>好了  那现在的问题是  为什么
<2-8,BECKETT>Okay, so then the question is, why?

57
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,940
<2-8,BECKETT>他们到底打的什么如意算盘
<2-8,BECKETT>What is their agenda?

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,600
<2-9,CASTLE>我们俩待在这里面是不会查出来的
<2-9,CASTLE>We're not gonna find out in here.

59
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,460
<2-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  明摆的事还用你说
<2-10,BECKETT>Well, Castle, thank you for stating the obvious.

60
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,560
<2-11,BECKETT>-你有信号吗  -没有
<2-11,BECKETT>- You got anything? - No, no.

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,310
<2-12,CASTLE>没有恒温器  也没有控制箱
<2-12,CASTLE>No thermostat, no control box.

62
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,480
<2-12,CASTLE>肯定是安在冰柜外面了
<2-12,CASTLE>Must be on the outside.

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,850
<2-13,BECKETT>你手机有信号吗
<2-13,BECKETT>Got any bars on your phone?

64
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,280
<2-12,CASTLE>没有
<2-12,CASTLE>No.

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,450
<2-14,CASTLE>等下  等下
<2-14,CASTLE>Wait, wait, wait.

66
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,760
<2-14,CASTLE>没有  你呢
<2-14,CASTLE>No. You?

67
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,990
<2-15,BECKETT>没有
<2-15,BECKETT>No.

68
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,420
<2-16,CASTLE>你觉得这里能有多冷
<2-16,CASTLE>How cold do you think it is in here?

69
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,310
<2-17,BECKETT>从感觉上来判断
<2-17,BECKETT>Um, judging by the way that it feels,

70
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,110
<2-17,BECKETT>我敢说绝对远低于零度
<2-17,BECKETT>I'd say it's well below freezing.

71
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,880
<2-18,CASTLE>你觉得咱俩穿成这样能撑多久
<2-18,CASTLE>How long do you think we're gonna last dressed like this?

72
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,440
<2-19,BECKETT>顶多几个小时
<2-19,BECKETT>A couple of hours at the most.

73
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,900
<2-20,CASTLE>我也这么觉得
<2-20,CASTLE>That's what I thought, too.

74
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,370
<2-21,CASTLE>那扇门是铁做的  我不认为
<2-21,CASTLE>That door is made of steel. I don't...

75
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,840
<2-21,CASTLE>我不认为你那样撞门能管用
<2-21,CASTLE>I don't think that's gonna do anything.

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
<2-22,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没人知道咱俩在这里
<2-22,BECKETT>Castle, nobody knows that we're in here.

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
<2-22,BECKETT>甚至没人会试图来找咱俩
<2-22,BECKETT>Nobody even knows to look for us.

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,400
<2-22,BECKETT>如果我们出不去就只能在这里冻死了
<2-22,BECKETT>We're gonna freeze to death if we don't get outta here.

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,970
<2-23,CASTLE>也许有别的方法可以出去
<2-23,CASTLE>Well, maybe there's another way out.

80
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,130
<2-24,CASTLE>好吧  倒数三下
<2-24,CASTLE>Right. Uh... On three?

81
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,700
<2-25,BECKETT>好  一  二
<2-25,BECKETT>Yeah. One. Two.

82
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,840
<2-26,CASTLE>-三  好  再来一次  一  -二
<2-26,CASTLE>- Three. Okay, again. One. - Two.

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,440
<2-27,BECKETT>三
<2-27,BECKETT>Three.

84
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,570
<2-27,BECKETT>再来  一
<2-27,BECKETT>again. One.

85
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,390
<2-27,BECKETT>-二  -三
<2-27,BECKETT>- Two. - Three.

86
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,640
<3-1,ALEXIS>我们没有必要回来
<3-1,ALEXIS>We didn't have to come back.

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,820
<3-1,ALEXIS>-我挺好的  -挺好的吗
<3-1,ALEXIS>- I was fine, you know. - Fine?

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,470
<3-2,MARTHA>我明显地感受到  我们离城越远
<3-2,MARTHA>I could literally feel your anxiety level rising

89
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,080
<3-2,MARTHA>你的焦躁程度就越发飙升
<3-2,MARTHA>the further we got from the city.

90
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,430
<3-2,MARTHA>一个灵修度假村
<3-2,MARTHA>A spiritual retreat

91
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,740
<3-2,MARTHA>应该让人放松身心  亲爱的
<3-2,MARTHA>is supposed to be spiritual, darling,

92
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,140
<3-2,MARTHA>不是充满压力
<3-2,MARTHA>Not stressful.

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,880
<3-2,MARTHA>等你没有考试缠身的时候
<3-2,MARTHA>We'll do it another time when you don't have a test

94
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,450
<3-2,MARTHA>我们再去吧
<3-2,MARTHA>hanging over you.

95
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,380
<3-2,MARTHA>尽管我能说出一大堆完美的借口
<3-2,MARTHA>Although I could've written you a brilliant excuse.

96
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,540
<3-2,MARTHA>我曾经在你爸身上用了很多经典的
<3-2,MARTHA>I used to write the best ones for your father...

97
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,440
<3-2,MARTHA>马戏团事故啊  公寓失火啊
<3-2,MARTHA>Circus accidents, apartment...fires.

98
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,390
<3-2,MARTHA>电影之夜吗
<3-2,MARTHA>Movie night?

99
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,210
<3-3,ALEXIS>我不知道
<3-3,ALEXIS>I don't know.

100
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,330
<3-3,ALEXIS>他用了投影仪  但是
<3-3,ALEXIS>He has the projector up, but...

101
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,760
<3-3,ALEXIS>他不在家
<3-3,ALEXIS>he's not here.

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,200
<3-4,MARTHA>也许他出去了  我的意思是...
<3-4,MARTHA>Well, maybe he's out, as in...

103
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,500
<3-5,ALEXIS>明白  恶心  但他若是在外面肯定会打来电话
<3-5,ALEXIS>Yes. Ew. But he always calls when he's out

104
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,780
<3-5,ALEXIS>或是留下字条
<3-5,ALEXIS>or leaves a note.

105
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,450
<3-6,MARTHA>他一想咱俩已经出城了
<3-6,MARTHA>Well, he figured we were gone,

106
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,980
<3-6,MARTHA>干嘛还要这么麻烦呢
<3-6,MARTHA>so why bother?

107
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,100
<3-6,MARTHA>很晚了  亲爱的  睡吧
<3-6,MARTHA>It's late, darling. Come on.

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,660
<3-6,MARTHA>我们明早上再问他
<3-6,MARTHA>We'll ask him in the morning.

109
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,810
<4-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这可不是好现象
<4-1,BECKETT>Castle, that's not good.

110
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,380
<4-2,CASTLE>的确不是
<4-2,CASTLE>No, it's not.

111
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,570
<4-3,BECKETT>好吧
<4-3,BECKETT>All right.

112
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,180
<4-3,BECKETT>往后站
<4-3,BECKETT>Stand back. Mm.

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,010
<4-4,CASTLE>-你要干嘛  -往后站就是了
<4-4,CASTLE>- What are you gonna do? - Just stand back.

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,250
<4-7,CASTLE>你想让咱俩早点挂掉吗
<4-7,CASTLE>Are you trying to kill us sooner?

115
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,520
<4-8,BECKETT>你难道有更好的办法吗
<4-8,BECKETT>Do you have a better idea?

116
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,750
<4-9,CASTLE>也许应该省几发子弹以防他们回来
<4-9,CASTLE>Maybe just save a few rounds in case they come back.

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
<4-9,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<4-9,CASTLE>Castle...

118
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,240
<4-10,BECKETT>在这困境中  我想找到
<4-10,BECKETT>I could use a silver lining

119
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,900
<4-10,BECKETT>最后一线生机  知道吗
<4-10,BECKETT>right about now, okay?

120
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,000
<4-11,CASTLE>知道
<4-11,CASTLE>Yeah. Um...

121
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,990
<4-11,CASTLE>我倒希望能有一线生机
<4-11,CASTLE>I wish I had one.

122
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,080
<5-1,RYAN>这解释不通啊
<5-1,RYAN>This doesn't make any sense.

123
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,820
<5-2,ESPOSITO>咋了  老兄
<5-2,ESPOSITO>What, bro?

124
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,900
<5-3,RYAN>给杰马尔搬家公司打工的那帮家伙
<5-3,RYAN>These guys that work for Jamal's moving company,

125
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,960
<5-3,RYAN>他们的确是中东人
<5-3,RYAN>they are middle eastern,

126
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,440
<5-3,RYAN>但绝大多数已经成为了美国公民
<5-3,RYAN>but most of 'em are citizens

127
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,930
<5-3,RYAN>就出生在美国
<5-3,RYAN>born here in the states.

128
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,940
<5-3,RYAN>除了几次交通违章
<5-3,RYAN>Aside from a couple of traffic violations,

129
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,180
<5-3,RYAN>他们案底清白
<5-3,RYAN>their records are clean.

130
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,510
<5-4,ESPOSITO>也许正因为这他们才被招募的
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Maybe that's why they were recruited.

131
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,920
<5-5,RYAN>你现在说话的口气开始像法伦了
<5-5,RYAN>Now you're starting to sound like Fallon.

132
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,970
<5-5,RYAN>也许卡塞尔是对的
<5-5,RYAN>You know, maybe Castle was right.

133
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,960
<5-5,RYAN>也许这件案子的确是另有蹊跷
<5-5,RYAN>Maybe there is something else going on here.

134
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,310
<5-5,RYAN>莱恩
<5-5,RYAN>Ryan.

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,400
<6-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>你查到什么了吗
<6-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>You get anything?

136
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,070
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>到目前为止还没有
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>Nothing so far.

137
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,300
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>他们声称根本不知道杰马尔的行踪
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>They claim to not know anything about Jamal's whereabouts

138
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,640
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>也不知道他要干什么
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>or his activities.

139
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,670
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>那些请了律师的人
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>And the ones that are lawyering up

140
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,220
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>控诉我们歧视性种族评判
<6-2,MONTGOMERY>are accusing us of racial profiling.

141
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,000
<6-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>他们没做错什么
<6-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>They're not wrong.

142
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,730
<6-4,MONTGOMERY>你还好吧
<6-4,MONTGOMERY>You okay?

143
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,140
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>和核弹相比
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>Compared to a nuke,

144
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,340
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>脏弹是一种粗制的装置
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>a dirty bomb is a fairly crude device.

145
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,660
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>它被设计用来在居民区引起恐慌
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's designed to instill fear in the populace.

146
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,540
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>瞬间性的杀伤力将会主要
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>The majority of the immediate damage

147
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,380
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>来自传统式的爆炸物
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>is gonna come from the conventional explosion,

148
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,460
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>形成一个死亡区域
<6-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>creating a kill zone.

149
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,650
<6-6,MONTGOMERY>就像俄克拉荷马市那次
<6-6,MONTGOMERY>Like Oklahoma city.

150
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,770
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>只不过这次不只会倒塌一栋大楼
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Except for it's not just a building that falls.

151
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,520
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>它会辐射到好几个街区
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>It spreads radiation for several blocks.

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,170
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>那是次生死亡区域
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>That's your secondary kill zone.

153
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,130
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>如果没有及时治疗  人们会在不到一周内
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>If left untreated, people can die from radiation poisoning

154
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,340
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>因辐射中毒而死
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>in less than a week.

155
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,570
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>但是真正使其成为如此有效的恐怖袭击武器
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>But what makes this such an effective terror weapon

156
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,090
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>是其对外区域的影响
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>is the outer zone.

157
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,280
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>在这片区域  每个人一开始都没有不良反应
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Now in this area, everybody seems fine at first.

158
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,730
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>随后开始有人患癌症
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Then the cancers start showing up...

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,670
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>婴儿  小孩  成年人
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>babies, kids, adults.

160
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,450
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>每报告新增一起病例
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>And with every new case that's reported,

161
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,620
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>人们就涌进急诊室  让医疗系统几近崩溃
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>people flock to the emergency rooms, overwhelm the system.

162
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,860
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>就好像我们又被恐怖袭击了一样
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's like we're being attacked all over again.

163
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,530
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>如果我们找不到脏弹
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Look, if we can't find the bomb,

164
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,570
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>也许我们可以找到袭击目标
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>maybe we can find the target.

165
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,010
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>动用手下所有人
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Pull everybody you got.

166
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,520
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>给我一份接下来四十八小时内
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Give me a list of every significant event

167
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,220
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>市内即将发生的所有重大事件的清单
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>going on in the city for the next 48 hours...

168
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,110
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>任何人口可能会密集的地方
<6-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>anyplace were people might gather in large numbers.

169
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,740
<6-8,MONTGOMERY>这可是纽约  每天都有数以百计的
<6-8,MONTGOMERY>This is New York city. There are a hundred events

170
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,170
<6-8,MONTGOMERY>大事件发生  我们必须缩小范围
<6-8,MONTGOMERY>going on every day. We have to narrow it down.

171
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,610
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>集中关注政治性的或是涉及到政府的事件
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Focus on anything political or government related.

172
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,250
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>这里要举办体育赛事吗
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Are there any sporting events going on?

173
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,810
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>联合国总部最近有什么动静
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>What's happening at the U.N.?

174
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,360
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>他们选择现在袭击也许是有原因的
<6-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Maybe there's a reason they're choosing to strike now.

175
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,920
<6-10,RYAN>长官  我能和你单独谈谈吗
<6-10,RYAN>Sir, can I speak with you alone?

176
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,770
<6-11,MONTGOMERY>失陪
<6-11,MONTGOMERY>Excuse us.

177
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,820
<7-1,MONTGOMERY>什么事
<7-1,MONTGOMERY>So what's wrong?

178
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,350
<7-2,RYAN>我刚和卡塞尔的女儿通完电话
<7-2,RYAN>I just got off the phone with Castle's daughter.

179
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,760
<7-2,RYAN>显然他没有回家
<7-2,RYAN>Apparently, he hasn't come home,

180
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,280
<7-2,RYAN>而她至今无法接通她老爸的电话
<7-2,RYAN>and she hasn't been able to reach him on his cell.

181
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,260
<7-4,ESPOSITO>-那又怎样  -卡塞尔被踢出特别行动组
<7-4,ESPOSITO>- So? - Castle got kicked off the task force.

182
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,670
<7-4,ESPOSITO>那他怎么可能不在家呢
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Why isn't he at home?

183
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,390
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>我怎么知道
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>How should I know?

184
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,120
<7-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特也一直没有接电话
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Well, Beckett's not answering her phone either.

185
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,060
<7-7,RYAN>鉴于他俩的作风  我们想...
<7-7,RYAN>We thought, given their history, that...

186
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,870
<7-8,ESPOSITO>我们认为他们可能卷入了某些事里
<7-8,ESPOSITO>we thought the two of them might have got on to something.

187
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,820
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>你俩明白一个恐怖组织
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>You two do realize that a terrorist cell

188
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,190
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>正威胁袭击本市
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>is threatening to strike

189
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,670
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>无数生命危在旦夕吗
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>and thousands of lives may be at risk?

190
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,870
<7-10,RYAN>-明白  但是...  -你们想我怎么做
<7-10,RYAN>- Yes, sir. But-- - What do you want me to do,

191
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,700
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>派出一队搜索队
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>send out a search party

192
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,080
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>就因为你们的同伴半夜三更
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>because your pals aren't answering their cell phones

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,940
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>没接电话吗
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>in the middle of the night?

194
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,900
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>-他俩可能正在外头小酌呢  -头儿
<7-11,MONTGOMERY>- For all I know, they could be out having a cold one. - Captain--

195
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,040
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>感谢你们的担心
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>I appreciate your concern,

196
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,570
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>想必他们也跟我一样
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>and I'm sure they appreciate your concern,

197
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,700
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>但他们能照顾好自己
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>but they can take care of themselves.

198
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,340
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>况且  我们还要找一名恐怖分子
<7-13,MONTGOMERY>Besides, we have a terrorist to find.

199
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,370
<7-14,RYAN>遵命  头儿
<7-14,RYAN>Yes, sir.

200
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,810
<7-14,RYAN>遵命  头儿
<7-14,RYAN>Yes, sir.

201
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,220
<7-14,RYAN>卡塞尔
<7-14,RYAN>Castle.

202
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,940
<8-1,BECKETT>你在吗
<8-1,BECKETT>Are you there?

203
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,170
<8-2,CASTLE>在在  我就在...
<8-2,CASTLE>Yeah, yeah. No, I'm-- I'm right--

204
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,730
<8-2,CASTLE>我就在这
<8-2,CASTLE>I'm right here.

205
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,570
<8-3,BECKETT>我都冻僵了
<8-3,BECKETT>I can't feel anything.

206
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,910
<8-3,BECKETT>我以前总是想....
<8-3,BECKETT>I always thought...

207
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,740
<8-3,BECKETT>当警察  最后准会中枪牺牲
<8-3,BECKETT>being a cop, I'd take a bullet.

208
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,870
<8-3,BECKETT>却从没想过会冻死
<8-3,BECKETT>I never thought I'd freeze to death.

209
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,280
<8-4,CASTLE>我们还没死啊
<8-4,CASTLE>W-w-we're not dead yet.

210
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,050
<8-5,BECKETT>我真希望这只是你的一个故事
<8-5,BECKETT>I just wish this was one of your books.

211
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,060
<8-5,BECKETT>那你就可以重写结局
<8-5,BECKETT>Then you could rewrite the ending.

212
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,830
<8-5,BECKETT>对
<8-5,BECKETT>Mm.

213
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,450
<8-6,CASTLE>我...对不起
<8-6,CASTLE>I'm s--I'm sorry.

214
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,370
<8-7,BECKETT>为什么道歉
<8-7,BECKETT>For what?

215
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,480
<8-8,CASTLE>都怪我太自我
<8-8,CASTLE>Fo-for being me...

216
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,090
<8-8,CASTLE>我行我素  结果把你拖进...
<8-8,CASTLE>going rogue, getting you into...

217
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,510
<8-8,CASTLE>这险境
<8-8,CASTLE>into this.

218
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,110
<8-8,CASTLE>如果我们没有单独行动
<8-8,CASTLE>If we hadn't gone on our own--

219
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,390
<8-9,BECKETT>嘘  别说了  卡塞尔
<8-9,BECKETT>Oh, shh. Shh. Castle, no.

221
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,090

<8-9,BECKETT>You were right.

222
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,780
<31-22,BECKETT>我们找到了炸弹
<31-22,BECKETT>We found the bomb.

223
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,720
<32-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>但为时已晚了  好吧
<32-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>We were just too late. Okay?

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,440
<10-12,JOSH>-不清楚  大概一小时了吧  -炸弹
<10-12,JOSH>- Uh, I don't know. About an hour? - The bomb.

255
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,860
<10-14,ESPOSITO>我们搜查了整座仓库  炸弹不见了
<10-14,ESPOSITO>We searched the entire warehouse. It's gone.

256
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,230
<10-15,CASTLE>你怎么找到我们的
<10-15,CASTLE>How'd you find us?

257
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,220
<10-16,ESPOSITO>阿丽克西斯打来  说你没回家
<10-16,ESPOSITO>Oh, Alexis called. Said you didn't come home.

258
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,860
<10-17,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  她不是出城了吗
<10-17,CASTLE>Alexis? She's supposed to be out of town.

259
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,190
<10-18,ESPOSITO>我想她回来了
<10-18,ESPOSITO>I guess she came back.

260
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,140
<10-18,ESPOSITO>我们本以为你和贝克特在一块  直到乔什来电话
<10-18,ESPOSITO>We figured you were with Beckett until Josh called.

261
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,840
<10-19,RYAN>我们想你们俩肯定在外头
<10-19,RYAN>We thought you must be out there

262
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,420
<10-19,RYAN>做着一些违反命令的大蠢事
<10-19,RYAN>doing something incredibly stupid against orders,

263
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,580
<10-19,RYAN>所以我们派出巡警
<10-19,RYAN>So we sent patrol units

264
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,870
<10-19,RYAN>四处巡查你俩笨得会单枪匹马前往的地方
<10-19,RYAN>everywhere we figured you'd be moronic enough to go.

265
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,700
<10-19,RYAN>接着找到了贝克特的车  搜查整个区域
<10-19,RYAN>Found Beckett's car, searched the area

266
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,000
<10-19,RYAN>最后找到了透着光线的贮藏箱
<10-19,RYAN>till we found the light from the storage container.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,080
<10-20,CASTLE>我很庆幸你们猜到我会做蠢事
<10-20,CASTLE>Well, I'm glad my stupidity is predictable.

268
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,280
<10-20,CASTLE>你们把我们救出来的吗
<10-20,CASTLE>You pulled us outta there?

269
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,870
<10-21,CASTLE>感激不尽
<10-21,CASTLE>Thanks.

270
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,810
<10-22,CASTLE>你的男朋友回来了
<10-22,CASTLE>So your boy's back in town.

271
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,320
<10-23,BECKETT>对
<10-23,BECKETT>Mm-hmm.

272
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,740
<10-23,BECKETT>他回来了
<10-23,BECKETT>He came back.

273
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,270
<10-24,CASTLE>那对你来说意味着什么
<10-24,CASTLE>So what does that mean to you?

274
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,970
<10-25,BECKETT>我和他还有希望
<10-25,BECKETT>It means we have a chance.

275
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,000
<10-25,BECKETT>来吧  法伦要听取汇报
<10-25,BECKETT>Come on. Fallon wants to debrief.

276
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,490
<10-26,CASTLE>你觉得他愿意相信咱们了吗
<10-26,CASTLE>Think he's ready to believe us?

277
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,130
<10-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>核能应急支持小组检测到了军用可变塑胶炸药
<10-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>N.E.S.T. confirms high levels of residual radiation

278
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,970
<10-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>和高强度残余辐射的痕迹
<10-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>along with a military-grade semtex.

279
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,750
<10-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>爆炸装置之前肯定放在了这里
<10-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>There's no question that device was here.

280
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,240
<10-28,MONTGOMERY>我已派人调出此地
<10-28,MONTGOMERY>I'll have my team pull surveillance tape

281
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,160
<10-28,MONTGOMERY>四百米内的所有监控器的录像带
<10-28,MONTGOMERY>on every camera within a quarter-mile of here.

282
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,390
<10-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>很好  我之后再向你跟进
<10-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>Sounds good. I'll catch up to you.

283
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,560
<10-30,MONTGOMERY>-贝克特  -头儿
<10-30,MONTGOMERY>- Beckett. - Sir.

284
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,010
<10-32,AGENT MARK FALLON>你们两个总是这么固执兼违抗命令的吗
<10-32,AGENT MARK FALLON>You two. Are you always this stubborn and insubordinate?

285
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,740
<10-33,CASTLE>只有当我们想拯救世人的时候会这样
<10-33,CASTLE>Only when we're trying to save the world.

286
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,180
<10-34,AGENT MARK FALLON>如果你们成功了  我会更赏识
<10-34,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'd be more impressed if you succeeded.

287
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,650
<10-34,AGENT MARK FALLON>你俩怎么知道找来这里的
<10-34,AGENT MARK FALLON>How did you know to come here?

288
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,900
<10-35,BECKETT>因为阿米尔的士上的监控器
<10-35,BECKETT>Security cameras in Amir's cab.

289
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,830
<10-35,BECKETT>我们认为他在监视租他车的
<10-35,BECKETT>We think that he was keeping tabs on

290
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,540
<10-35,BECKETT>其中一个司机凯文·麦凯恩
<10-35,BECKETT>one of his drivers--Kevin Mccann.

291
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,180
<10-36,CASTLE>我们调出了麦凯恩的行车记录
<10-36,CASTLE>We pulled Mccann's route records.

292
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,590
<10-36,CASTLE>结果发现他去过华盛顿高地
<10-36,CASTLE>Turns out he visited that storage facility in Washington heights

293
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,510
<10-36,CASTLE>存放着放射性物质的储藏公司
<10-36,CASTLE>where the radioactive material was being kept

294
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,230
<10-36,CASTLE>还早在阿米尔之前就来过这仓库
<10-36,CASTLE>and this warehouse long before Amir did.

295
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,650
<10-37,AGENT MARK FALLON>麦凯恩在他之前来过这里
<10-37,AGENT MARK FALLON>Mccann was here before him?

296
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,330
<10-38,BECKETT>对  看来阿米尔在跟踪麦凯恩
<10-38,BECKETT>Yeah, it looks like Amir was following Mccann,

297
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,580
<10-38,BECKETT>想查出他在密谋什么
<10-38,BECKETT>trying to figure out what he was up to

298
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,840
<10-38,BECKETT>结果自己却被抓住杀害了
<10-38,BECKETT>until he was caught and killed.

299
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,950
<10-39,CASTLE>因为他们原本的替罪羊阿米尔死了
<10-39,CASTLE>And with Amir, their intended patsy dead,

300
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,060
<10-39,CASTLE>我们认为他们想把
<10-39,CASTLE>we think they were trying to

301
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,980
<10-39,CASTLE>罪名栽赃给他的表哥杰马尔
<10-39,CASTLE>implicate his cousin Jamal as the bomber.

302
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,830
<10-39,CASTLE>所以他们才把他的尸体冷冻起来
<10-39,CASTLE>That's why they were keeping his body on ice.

303
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,540
<10-40,AGENT MARK FALLON>你们有看清在场的任何一名恐怖分子吗
<10-40,AGENT MARK FALLON>Did you see any other members of the cell here?

304
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,290
<10-41,BECKETT>没有  环境太暗了
<10-41,BECKETT>No, it was dark.

305
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,090
<10-42,CASTLE>-他们还开枪了  -但我们
<10-42,CASTLE>- And they were shooting. - But we do

306
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,300
<10-43,BECKETT>确定炸弹安放在一辆车后车侧
<10-43,BECKETT>know that the bomb is housed in a white commercial van

307
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,150
<10-43,BECKETT>都有车门的白色面包车里
<10-43,BECKETT>with a rear and side passenger door.

308
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,040
<10-44,AGENT MARK FALLON>在纽约找一辆白色面包车吗
<10-44,AGENT MARK FALLON>A white van in new york city?

309
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,180
<10-44,AGENT MARK FALLON>这个范围还真是"窄"啊
<10-44,AGENT MARK FALLON>Well, that narrows it down.

310
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,600
<10-45,CASTLE>我们看到了计时器  炸弹设置在今天4点爆炸
<10-45,CASTLE>We saw the counter. It's set to go off at 4:00 today.

311
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,480
<10-46,AGENT MARK FALLON>距离爆炸时间不足10小时了  好了
<10-46,AGENT MARK FALLON>That's less than ten hours from now. All right.

312
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,980
<10-46,AGENT MARK FALLON>我会设立关卡  但炸弹已经运到市里了
<10-46,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'll put up checkpoints. But it's already in the city.

313
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,440
<10-47,BECKETT>我知道所有的证据都指向阿米尔和杰马尔
<10-47,BECKETT>Look, I know all the evidence points to Amir and Jamal,

314
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,280
<10-47,BECKETT>但当中肯定有更重大的隐情
<10-47,BECKETT>but something bigger is going on here,

315
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,550
<10-47,BECKETT>凯文·麦凯恩绝对脱不了关系
<10-47,BECKETT>and Kevin Mccann is involved.

316
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,780
<10-47,BECKETT>收到  喂
<10-47,BECKETT>Got it. Yo.

317
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,360
<10-48,ESPOSITO>刚和的士公司联系过
<10-48,ESPOSITO>That was a taxi company.

318
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,880
<10-48,ESPOSITO>麦凯恩本该现在轮班
<10-48,ESPOSITO>Mccann's supposed to be on shift right now,

319
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,890
<10-48,ESPOSITO>但他却没有出现
<10-48,ESPOSITO>but he didn't show up

320
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,930
<10-48,ESPOSITO>他也没有接电话
<10-48,ESPOSITO>and he's not answering his phone.

321
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,820
<10-49,AGENT MARK FALLON>查到他家地址了吗
<10-49,AGENT MARK FALLON>Did you get an address?

322
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,700
<10-50,RYAN>车管所登记的住址是
<10-50,RYAN>D.M.V. lists an apartment off

323
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,160
<10-50,RYAN>布朗克斯区杰若姆大道的一间公寓
<10-50,RYAN>Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

324
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,460
<10-51,AGENT MARK FALLON>好了  召集一个小队
<10-51,AGENT MARK FALLON>All right. Get a team together.

325
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,380
<10-51,AGENT MARK FALLON>-马上去那里抓人  -法伦探员
<10-51,AGENT MARK FALLON>- Go up there and get him. - Agent Fallon?

326
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,080
<10-54,BECKETT>-什么事  -鉴于目前情况  我们请求
<10-54,BECKETT>- Yeah? - Given the circumstances, we'd like to request

327
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,460
<10-54,BECKETT>重回特别行动组
<10-54,BECKETT>to be reinstated on the task force.

328
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,890
<10-55,AGENT MARK FALLON>那不是我说了算
<10-55,AGENT MARK FALLON>Well, that's not up to me.

329
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,890
<10-55,AGENT MARK FALLON>得由你的医生说了算  对吧
<10-55,AGENT MARK FALLON>It'll be up to your doctor, isn't it?

330
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,270
<10-56,AGENT MARK FALLON>真有趣
<10-56,AGENT MARK FALLON>You know, it's funny.

331
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,210
<10-56,AGENT MARK FALLON>我第一次见到你俩时  以为你俩是一对
<10-56,AGENT MARK FALLON>When I first met you two, I thought you were together.

332
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,190
<10-57,CASTLE>没有  我们只是朋友
<10-57,CASTLE>Oh. No, just--just friends.

<10-58,AGENT MARK FALLON>去洗个澡
<10-58,AGENT MARK FALLON>Get cleaned up.

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,990
<10-58,AGENT MARK FALLON>接下来  有我们忙的了
<10-58,AGENT MARK FALLON>We got a long day ahead of us.

335
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,070
<11-1,MARTHA>理查德  我的宝贝  你没事吧
<11-1,MARTHA>Oh, Richard, darling. Oh, are you all right?

336
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,690
<11-2,CASTLE>你还要披着那张毛毯吗
<11-2,CASTLE>Are you using that blanket?

337
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,060
<11-3,MARTHA>不用了  我正想给你
<11-3,MARTHA>Oh, no. I'm gonna give it to you.

339
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,580
<11-5,MARTHA>你看上去毫无生气
<11-5,MARTHA>You look like death warmed over.

340
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,190
<11-6,CASTLE>如果有人向你们推崇低温学说
<11-6,CASTLE>If someone tries to sell you on cryogenics,

341
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,000
<11-7,ALEXIS>-别信他们  -我知道你不会不说一声
<11-7,ALEXIS>- say no. - I knew you wouldn't turn your phone off

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,410
<11-7,ALEXIS>就关掉手机的
<11-7,ALEXIS>without leaving me a message.

343
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,570
<11-8,MARTHA>是因为那个的哥的命案吗
<11-8,MARTHA>Now is this about the cab driver?

344
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,090
<11-9,CASTLE>听着  我要你们为我做件事
<11-9,CASTLE>Look, I need you girls to do something for me.

<11-9,CASTLE>但我不希望你们多问
<11-9,CASTLE>But I don't want you to ask any questions.

<11-9,CASTLE>我要你们马上去汉普顿
<11-9,CASTLE>I want you to go the Hamptons.

<11-9,CASTLE>I want you to stay there for the weekend.

348
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,550
<11-10,MARTHA>理查德  究竟出什么事了
<11-10,MARTHA>Richard, what is this about?

349
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,720
<11-11,CASTLE>看  不让多问的
<11-11,CASTLE>See, that-- that's a question.

350
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,940
<11-11,CASTLE>听着  纽约可能会...
<11-11,CASTLE>Look, there might be a...

351
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,940
<11-11,CASTLE>有一场灾难....
<11-11,CASTLE>an event...

352
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,030
<11-11,CASTLE>继续留在市区  会有性命危险
<11-11,CASTLE>that will make it very dangerous to stay in the city.

353
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,530
<11-12,ALEXIS>-你干什么  -打给阿什利
<11-12,ALEXIS>- What are you doing? - Calling Ashley.

354
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,960
<11-13,CASTLE>不  不行  你不能告诉任何人
<11-13,CASTLE>No, no, no, no. You can't tell anybody.

355
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,240
<11-13,CASTLE>懂吗  不能告诉任何人  如果你告诉了阿什利
<11-13,CASTLE>Okay? You can't tell anybody. You tell Ashley,

356
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,490
<11-13,CASTLE>他一定会告诉他父母  他父母又会告诉亲朋好友
<11-13,CASTLE>he'll tell his parents, they'll call someone they love,

357
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,760
<11-13,CASTLE>那...就会造成市民恐慌
<11-13,CASTLE>and...a panic will make this thing

358
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,630
<11-13,CASTLE>让事件更加一发不可收拾
<11-13,CASTLE>a thousand times harder to stop.

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,070
<12-3,CASTLE>你有想过法伦吗
<12-3,CASTLE>You ever wonder about Fallon?

372
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,960
<12-3,CASTLE>对他说  那是怎样的感觉
<12-3,CASTLE>I mean, what this must be like for him,

373
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,580
<12-3,CASTLE>天天过着这样的生活
<12-3,CASTLE>living this every day?

374
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,190
<12-3,CASTLE>我让阿丽克西斯和我妈出城去
<12-3,CASTLE>I told Alexis and my mother to get out of town.

375
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,950
<12-3,CASTLE>我没告诉她们原因  但她们知道
<12-3,CASTLE>I didn't tell them why, but they knew.

376
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,460
<12-3,CASTLE>她们想告诉朋友
<12-3,CASTLE>They wanted to tell their friends,

377
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,660
<12-3,CASTLE>而我说不可以
<12-3,CASTLE>and I told them they couldn't.

378
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,370
<12-3,CASTLE>我觉得自己像个恶人
<12-3,CASTLE>I felt like a monster.

379
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,810
<12-3,CASTLE>我是说  如果这种感觉一直伴随着你
<12-3,CASTLE>I mean, that must be some kind of hell...

380
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,040
<12-3,CASTLE>肯定是很难熬的
<12-3,CASTLE>feeling that all the time.

381
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,020
<12-4,BECKETT>让想你知道
<12-4,BECKETT>Kinda makes you wonder

382
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,240
<12-4,BECKETT>自911之后  有多少这样的事发生
<12-4,BECKETT>how many times this has happened since 9/11

383
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,010
<12-4,BECKETT>而我们却蒙在鼓里
<12-4,BECKETT>and we were the ones who didn't know.

385
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,500
<13-1,ESPOSITO>麦凯恩的住址是个死胡同
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Yeah, the Mccann address is a dead end.

386
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,180
<13-1,ESPOSITO>一个韩国裔家庭住在这里
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Korean family lives here.

<13-1,ESPOSITO>已经住了4年
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Been living here for the past four years.

388
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,320
<13-2,BECKETT>你搜查过房子吗
<13-2,BECKETT>Did you search the place?

389
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,600
<13-3,ESPOSITO>是的  但没有发现异常
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary.

390
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,120
<13-3,ESPOSITO>但我们问了一个老邻居  他们说
<13-3,ESPOSITO>But we did talk to a longtime neighbor, and they said

391
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,140
<13-3,ESPOSITO>麦凯恩一家曾在这住过  已是十几年前了
<13-3,ESPOSITO>the Mccann family lived here, but it was over a decade ago.

392
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,770
<13-3,ESPOSITO>她记起他们有个儿子叫凯文
<13-3,ESPOSITO>She seems to recall something about them having a son,

393
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,810
<13-3,ESPOSITO>他参了军
<13-3,ESPOSITO>named Kevin, and he went in the military.

394
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,140
<13-3,ESPOSITO>凯文·麦凯恩

<14-2,BECKETT>六次吗
<14-2,BECKETT>Six tours?

399
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,710
<14-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>现在越来越少人当兵了
<14-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Military is stretched pretty thin these days.

400
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,000
<14-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>这说不通啊
<14-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Doesn't make any sense.

401
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,920
<14-4,CASTLE>一位战争英雄怎么跟恐怖袭击搅在一起
<14-4,CASTLE>What's a war hero doing mixed up in a terrorist plot?

402
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
<14-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>别看我  这是你的推论
<14-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>Don't look at me, pal. It's your theory.

403
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,950
<14-6,BECKETT>他们有地址吗

410
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
<14-8,BECKETT>有人盗用了他的身份
<14-8,BECKETT>So someone stole his identity.

411
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,370
<14-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>可以是任何人

412
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,660
<14-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>也可能是外国特务

413
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,990
<15-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>把这个和联邦调查局和中情局
<15-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Run this through FBI and CIA

414
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,020
<15-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>甚至是国际刑警组织的脸部识别数据库作对比
<15-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>facial recognition databases all the way up to interpol.

415
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,590
<15-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>我要这家伙的一切资料
<15-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>I want to know everything I can about this guy.

416
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,000
<15-2,BECKETT>技术组追查到
<15-2,BECKETT>All right, so tech tracked the phone

417
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,810
<15-2,BECKETT>他化名为麦凯恩的电话
<15-2,BECKETT>that he's been using under the Mccann name.

418
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,340
<15-2,BECKETT>巡警刚在垃圾桶找到的  擦拭得很干净
<15-2,BECKETT>Patrol units just found it in a dumpster. Been wiped clean.

419
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,730
<15-2,BECKETT>我们发出了全面通缉令
<15-2,BECKETT>We've got an A.P.B. out on him and

420
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,750
<15-2,BECKETT>给每个人派发他的照片
<15-2,BECKETT>we sent copies of his photo to everyone.

421
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,610
<15-3,ESPOSITO>小分队正前往出租车库
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Teams are on their way to the taxi depot

422
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,920
<15-3,ESPOSITO>扣查他开过的车  套取指纹
<15-3,ESPOSITO>and the impound to pull prints from the cabs he drove,

423
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,140
<15-3,ESPOSITO>但有太多的司机和乘客
<15-3,ESPOSITO>but with multiple drivers and passengers,

424
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,710
<15-3,ESPOSITO>每一辆车上都有成百个指纹
<15-3,ESPOSITO>there are gonna be hundreds of prints in each cab.

425
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,410
<15-3,ESPOSITO>颇费时间
<15-3,ESPOSITO>It's gonna take some time.

426
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,860
<15-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们没有时间了
<15-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's time we don't have.

427
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,150
<15-5,CASTLE>他为何要偷麦凯恩的身份吗
<15-5,CASTLE>Why would he steal Mccann's identity?

428
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,620
<15-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>我原以为这家伙是犯罪小说家
<15-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>I thought this guy was a crime novelist?

429
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,950
<15-7,CASTLE>我是
<15-7,CASTLE>I-I am.

430
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,520
<15-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>那你就该知道有时犯了法的人
<15-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>Then you should know that sometimes people who operate

431
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,840
<15-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>会拿已故者的社保号
<15-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>outside the law will take the social security number

432
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,280
<15-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>用来伪造一个新身份
<15-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>of a deceased individual and use it to forge a new identity.

433
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,490
<15-9,CASTLE>我知道  我书里出现3次了
<15-9,CASTLE>I know. I've done it three times in my books.

434
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,580
<15-9,CASTLE>我想说的是
<15-9,CASTLE>What I'm saying is,

435
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,800
<15-9,CASTLE>为什么他要偷凯文·麦凯恩的身份
<15-9,CASTLE>why would he steal Kevin Mccann's identity?

436
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,570
<15-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>因为这很方便
<15-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>Because it was convenient.

437
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,290
<15-11,CASTLE>为什么方便呢
<15-11,CASTLE>Why was it convenient?

438
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,500
<15-11,CASTLE>为了诬陷阿米尔  打进他
<15-11,CASTLE>I mean, the money that was deposited into Amir's account

439
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,230
<15-11,CASTLE>账户上的钱
<15-11,CASTLE>to implicate him,

440
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,730
<15-11,CASTLE>我们追查到阿富汗
<15-11,CASTLE>we tracked it back to Afghanistan.

441
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,350
<15-11,CASTLE>麦凯恩曾在阿富汗服役
<15-11,CASTLE>Mccann served in Afghanistan.

442
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,800
<15-11,CASTLE>也许这其中有关联
<15-11,CASTLE>Maybe there's a link.

443
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,060
<15-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>怎样的关联
<15-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>What kind of link?

444
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,550
<15-13,CASTLE>我不知道  也许这家伙并不是
<15-13,CASTLE>I don't know. Maybe... Maybe this guy wasn't just

445
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,720
<15-13,CASTLE>随便偷一个死人的身份
<15-13,CASTLE>Stealing the identity of some random dead guy.

446
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
<15-13,CASTLE>也许  麦凯恩是他认识的人
<15-13,CASTLE>Maybe... Mccann is someone he knew

447
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,630
<15-13,CASTLE>或是他必须冒名顶替的人
<15-13,CASTLE>or someone he needed to be.

<16-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>In his letters, did he ever display

470
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,220
<16-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>对国家的仇恨吗
<16-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>any animosity toward this country?

471
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,720
<16-9,COLLEEN MCCANN>他为何问我这个
<16-9,COLLEEN MCCANN>Why is he asking me that?

472
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,670
<16-10,BECKETT>海耶斯先生有可能
<16-10,BECKETT>There's a possibility that Mr. Hayes is working

473
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,630
<16-10,BECKETT>与一群极端份子策划袭击美国
<16-10,BECKETT>with a set of extremists who are plotting against the U.S.

474
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,400
<16-11,COLLEEN MCCANN>不
<16-11,COLLEEN MCCANN>No.

475

<16-12,BECKETT>科琳
<16-12,BECKETT>Colleen?

476
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,360
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>凯文死后  拉福德带我去喝酒
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>Radford took me out for a beer after Kevin died,

477
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,100
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>他当时愤愤不平
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>and he was angry--

478
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,490
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>气愤大家不再关心战争
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>Angry at how everyone stopped caring about the war.

479
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,210
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>好像这战争从未发生过
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>Like it wasn't even happening,

480
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,280
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>恼火政客对待士兵的方式
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>Angry at the way politicians were treating soldiers,

481
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,270
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>好像他们是纸巾  利用完就扔一边
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>like they were tissue paper, to be used and thrown away.

482
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,640
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>他觉得华盛顿那帮家伙
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>He thought the folks in Washington

483
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,870
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>更关心达到政治目标  而非胜利
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>cared more about scoring political points than winning.

484
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,770
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>他说也许这国家需要
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>He said that maybe what this country needed

485
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,870
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>敲响另一记警钟
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>was another wake-up call.

486
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,820
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>也许下一次  会达到目的
<16-13,COLLEEN MCCANN>Maybe next time, we'd get it right.

487
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,410
<16-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>你知道在哪可以找到他吗
<16-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>Do you know where we can find him?

488
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,460
<16-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>不知道
<16-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>No.

489
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,300
<16-15,COLLEEN MCCANN>我只有他的手机号
<16-15,COLLEEN MCCANN>All I have is his cell phone number.

490
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,820
<17-1,HOMELAND SECURITY TECH>他手机开机了  但款式很旧  无自带GPS
<17-1,HOMELAND SECURITY TECH>His phone's active, but it's old-school. No native gps.

491
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,560
<17-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>多久才能定位到他
<17-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>How long before you get a fix on him?

492
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,690
<17-3,HOMELAND SECURITY TECH>我需要几分钟通过手机信号塔三角定位
<17-3,HOMELAND SECURITY TECH>I'll need a few minutes to triangulate off the cell towers.

493
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,910
<17-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>放手去做  别让他知道我们在追踪他
<17-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>Do what you gotta do. Just don't let him know we're coming.

494
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,420
<17-5,MONTGOMERY>很难相信我们在追踪自己人
<17-5,MONTGOMERY>I can't believe we're chasing one of our own.

495
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,320
<17-6,CASTLE>他没有错  过去我们上战场
<17-6,CASTLE>He's not wrong, you know? Used to be, we'd go to war,

496
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,470
<17-6,CASTLE>大家牺牲和奉献
<17-6,CASTLE>everybody sacrifices, everybody pitches in.

497
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,100
<17-6,CASTLE>现在新闻上都看不到了
<17-6,CASTLE>Now you don't even see it on the news.

498
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,900
<17-6,CASTLE>我不是在为他辩护
<17-6,CASTLE>I'm not defending him.

499
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,370
<17-6,CASTLE>我只是说我理解他的愤慨
<17-6,CASTLE>I'm just saying, I understand the anger.

500
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,730
<17-7,BECKETT>阿米尔是完美的替罪羊
<17-7,BECKETT>Well, Amir is the perfect patsy.

<17-7,BECKETT>He has a background in weapons engineering, ties to Syria,

502
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,340
<17-7,BECKETT>正是阿尔盖达组织招募的理想对象
<17-7,BECKETT>which is a hotbed for Al Qaeda recruiting.

503
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,320
<17-7,BECKETT>上面写满了恐怖主义
<17-7,BECKETT>I mean, it has terrorist written all over it.

504
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,310
<17-8,CASTLE>他阿富汗账户里的钱
<17-8,CASTLE>And the money from his Afghanistan account

505
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,450
<17-8,CASTLE>使人们相信塔利班参与其中
<17-8,CASTLE>would've had people believing Taliban was involved.

506
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,540
<17-9,BECKETT>恐惧让我们很程序化
<17-9,BECKETT>We're so programmed by fear.

507
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,470
<17-9,BECKETT>人们完全如拉福德所愿
<17-9,BECKETT>People are gonna believe exactly what Radford wants us

508
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,970
<17-9,BECKETT>相信我们又遭恐怖袭击了
<17-9,BECKETT>to believe-that we were attacked again--

509
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,470
<17-9,BECKETT>他们就会血战血偿
<17-9,BECKETT>and then they're gonna cry out for blood.

510
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,910
<17-10,MONTGOMERY>还剩不到4个小时
<17-10,MONTGOMERY>Less than four hours.

511
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,440
<17-11,CASTLE>如果不能阻止  我们不该公之于众吗
<17-11,CASTLE>If we can't stop it, shouldn't we tell people?,

512
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,630
<17-12,MONTGOMERY>告诉大家什么  有个脏弹

<20-11,RADFORD HAYES>人们会把这当做恐怖袭击
<20-11,RADFORD HAYES>People will see this as an act of terrorism,

570
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,390
<20-11,RADFORD HAYES>然后开始寻找恐怖分子
<20-11,RADFORD HAYES>so they will be looking for a terrorist,

571
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,140
<20-11,RADFORD HAYES>而不是爱国者  决不是自己人
<20-11,RADFORD HAYES>not a patriot, not one of their own.

572
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,940
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>原来你自以为是爱国者
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>Is that what you think you are, a patriot?

573
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,980
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>有一个词专门用来形容你这种人
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>There's a word for people like you,

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,380
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>不过不是"爱国者"
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>And it's not "patriot."

575
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>而是"叛国者"
<20-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's "traitor."

576
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,770
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>当局对叛国者来说没用
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>The powers that be have no use for a traitor.

577
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>等他们找到了恐怖分子
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>So when they find their terrorist,

578
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,100
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>当然他们一定会找到恐怖分子
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>and they will find their terrorist,

579
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,450
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>你觉得我会怎么样
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>what do you think will happen to me?

580
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,350
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>我来告诉你  因为我了解他们
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>Well, let me tell you, because I know them,

581
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,120
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>所以我知道他们的思维方式
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>I know how they think.

582
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,800
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>我会成为你一堆陈旧文件里
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>I will become a footnote in one of your files

583
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,600
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>一个小小注脚  永远都不会被注意
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>buried so far back, no one will ever find it,

584
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,770
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>因为任何多余的东西
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>because anything more would be an inconvenience

585
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,010
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>都会妨碍他们自私自利蛊惑民心的演说
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>to their self-serving, rabble-rousing narrative.

586
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,440
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>所以你们干嘛不让我们省省心
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>So why don't you do us all a favor

587
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,460
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>接受不可避免的现实呢
<20-13,RADFORD HAYES>and just accept the inevitable?

588
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,030
<20-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>你以为这是个笑话  你以为我在逗你玩
<20-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>You think this is a joke? You think I'm playing with you?!

589
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,660
<20-15,AGENT MARK FALLON>炸弹在哪里
<20-15,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where's the bomb?!

590
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,760
<20-15,AGENT MARK FALLON>-炸弹在哪里  -法伦  不要
<20-15,AGENT MARK FALLON>- Where's the bomb?! - Fallon, no!

591
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,050
<20-17,AGENT MARK FALLON>在哪里  目标是哪里  拉福德
<20-17,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where is it? Where's the target, Radford?

592
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,850
<20-18,BECKETT>-法伦  放下武器  -目标是哪里
<20-18,BECKETT>- Lower your weapon, Fallon. - Where's the target?

593
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,210
<20-21,BECKETT>法伦  马上放下武器
<20-21,BECKETT>Fallon! Lower your weapon now!

594
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,190
<20-22,AGENT MARK FALLON>除非他告诉我我问题的答案
<20-22,AGENT MARK FALLON>Not until he tells me what I want to hear.

595
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,830
<20-23,BECKETT>-在哪里  -放下武器
<20-23,BECKETT>- Where is it?! - Lower your weapon!

596
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,970
<20-24,AGENT MARK FALLON>你准备好上路了吗
<20-24,AGENT MARK FALLON>You ready to go all the way? Huh?

597
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,180
<20-25,RADFORD HAYES>我做好了为我的国家献身的准备
<20-25,RADFORD HAYES>I'm prepared to die for my country.

598
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,420
<20-25,RADFORD HAYES>你呢
<20-25,RADFORD HAYES>Are you?

599
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,100
<20-26,BECKETT>马上放下武器
<20-26,BECKETT>Put down your weapon now.

600
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,740
<21-2,CASTLE>嗨  我来吧
<21-2,CASTLE>Hey. I got that.

601
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,730
<21-3,BECKETT>谢谢
<21-3,BECKETT>Thank you.

602
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,240
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>知道吗  他不会开口的
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>He wasn't gonna break, you know?

603
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,490
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>要是再多几天  或是一个周  还有可能
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>If I had a couple of days, maybe a week,

604
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,850
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>三个小时  不可能
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>but not in three hours.

605
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,460
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们得让他开口  我看到了突破口就利用了
<21-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>We needed him to break. I saw an opening. I took it.

606
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,920
<21-5,BECKETT>你侵犯了他的权利
<21-5,BECKETT>You violated his rights.

607
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,690
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>我能想出一堆联邦律师
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>I can think of probably a dozen federal lawyers

608
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,030
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>他们都会不赞同你的说法
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>that would disagree with that.

609
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,240
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>他从未真正受到威胁
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>He was never in any real danger.

610
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,430
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>我把子弹从弹匣里取出了  枪压根没上膛
<21-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>I removed the bullets from my clip. My gun wasn't even loaded.

611
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,260
<21-7,BECKETT>-我的上了  -我知道
<21-7,BECKETT>- Well, mine was. - Yeah. Well,

612
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,060
<21-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>不过我很确定你不会开枪打我
<21-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>I was pretty sure you weren't gonna shoot me.

613
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,290
<21-9,BECKETT>要是有下一次  我可不会这么确定
<21-9,BECKETT>You know, next time, I wouldn't be so sure.

614
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,370
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>探长  我明白你可能比较讨厌我
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>Detective, I understand that you probably hate me.

615
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,230
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>你俩都有这个权利
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>You have every right to, both of you.

616
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,440
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>但我的职责不是交朋友
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>But my job isn't to make friends.

617
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,830
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>而是阻止坏事发生
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's to stop bad things from happening.

618
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,580
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>还有几个小时我们就要眼睁睁看着
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>And seeing as how we're just a couple of hours

619
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,960
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>恐怖事件的发生
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>away from a major terrorist event

620
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,120
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>而现在我们竟一筹莫展
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>and we are basically back at square one.

621
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,390
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>我的确需要你的帮助
<21-10,AGENT MARK FALLON>I could really use your help.

622
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,700
<21-11,BECKETT>遵命  长官
<21-11,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

623
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,310
<21-12,CASTLE>老天  这家伙经过混蛋培训
<21-12,CASTLE>Man, does that guy take Jackhole lessons

624
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,750
<21-12,CASTLE>还是天生如此
<21-12,CASTLE>or was he born that way?

625
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,680
<21-13,RYAN>都不是
<21-13,RYAN>Neither.

626
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,150
<21-13,RYAN>我问过我在国土安全局的朋友
<21-13,RYAN>I asked my buddy at D.H.S. about him.

627
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,460
<21-13,RYAN>原来他在911中失去了妻子
<21-13,RYAN>Turns out his wife was killed on 9/11.

628
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,070
<21-13,RYAN>她在第二座塔楼倒塌时丧命了
<21-13,RYAN>She rode the second tower down.

629
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,380
<21-13,RYAN>当时他们正在通话中
<21-13,RYAN>They were on the phone together when it happened.

630
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,580
<21-14,BECKETT>他是对的
<21-14,BECKETT>He's right.

631
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,650
<21-14,BECKETT>要是不能撬开拉福德的嘴  我们就死定了
<21-14,BECKETT>If we don't get Radford to talk, we're dead in the water.

632
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,010
<21-15,CASTLE>也许不会
<21-15,CASTLE>Maybe not.

633
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,280
<22-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>我需要探测员前往
<22-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Okay, I need backpack detectors spread out

634
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,740
<22-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>十个最可能被袭击的场所
<22-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>to the ten most likely targets.

635
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,480
<22-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>让核应急支援小组准备好  出发
<22-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Get the N.E.S.T. teams ready. Go.

636
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:56,440
<22-2,CASTLE>杰马尔和阿米尔的同谋调查怎么样了
<22-2,CASTLE>Where are we on Jamal and Amir's coconspirators?

637
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,020
<22-2,CASTLE>共谋者
<22-2,CASTLE>Coconspirators?

638
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,080
<22-4,BECKETT>为什么  我们已经知道他们是替罪羊了
<22-4,BECKETT>Why? We know that they're patsies.

639
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,670
<22-5,CASTLE>记得拉福德说炸弹爆炸时的情况吗
<22-5,CASTLE>Remember what Radford said about the bomb going off?

640
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,440
<22-5,CASTLE>他说我们会找到恐怖分子
<22-5,CASTLE>He said we will find our terrorist.

641
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,120
<22-5,CASTLE>但杰马尔和阿米尔已经死了
<22-5,CASTLE>But with Jamal and Amir out of the picture...

642
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,520
<22-6,BECKETT>他们会想方设法嫁祸别人
<22-6,BECKETT>They're gonna try to pin it on someone else.

643
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,200
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>跟他们俩都有关的某人
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Somebody related to them both.

644
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,800
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>找出所有跟阿米尔和杰马尔·阿哈比
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>All right. Get locations on all known associates

645
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,850
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>有关系的人  不管之前
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>of Amir and Jamal Alhabi. I don't care

646
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,210
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>有没有排除他们
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>if we've dismissed 'em before.

647
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,440
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>不能漏过任何一个有中东血统的人
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Anybody of middle-eastern origin or descent.

648
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,990
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>纳兹哈  阿米尔的妻子  找到她
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Nazihah, Amir's wife, find her, track her down.

649
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,360
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>看她愿不愿意合作
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>See if she'll cooperate.

650
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,530
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>她信任你  也许她
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>She trusts you. Maybe she

651
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,350
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>-能帮我们缩小搜查范围  -现在就去
<22-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>- can help us narrow down the list. - On it.

653
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,940
<23-2,BECKETT>那是法伦派出的负责监视的人
<23-2,BECKETT>That's Fallon's surveillance guy.

654
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,900
<23-3,BECKETT>纳兹哈
<23-3,BECKETT>Nazihah.

655
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,210
<23-4,BECKETT>纳兹哈
<23-4,BECKETT>Nazihah!

656
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,760
<23-4,BECKETT>纳兹哈
<23-4,BECKETT>Nazihah!

657
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,280
<23-5,BECKETT>她不在  孩子也不在
<23-5,BECKETT>She's gone. So is the kid.

658
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,760
<23-5,BECKETT>什么
<23-5,BECKETT>What?

659
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,350
<23-6,CASTLE>我在桌子上发现了这个
<23-6,CASTLE>I found this on the table.

660
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,790
<23-7,BECKETT>"真主至大  上帝伟大  我执行光荣使命
<23-7,BECKETT>"Allah Akbar. God is great. I go to my glory

<23-7,BECKETT>against the forces of the infidel."

662
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,900
<23-7,BECKETT>她是新的恐怖分子
<23-7,BECKETT>She's their new terrorist.

663
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,370
<23-7,BECKETT>他们会让她引爆炸弹
<23-7,BECKETT>They're gonna have her set off the bomb.

664
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,000
<24-1,RYAN>-但谁都没看到劫持发生  -交通录像呢
<24-1,RYAN>- But none of them saw the abduction. - What about the traffic cams?

665
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,200
<24-3,RYAN>我派人去了  但还剩下不到两小时
<24-3,RYAN>I got teams out there, but with less than two hours left,

666
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,520
<24-3,RYAN>没有时间一个一个看了
<24-3,RYAN>There's no time to go through all the footage.

667
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,510
<24-4,CASTLE>蒙哥马利哪去了
<24-4,CASTLE>Where's Montgomery?

668
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,330
<24-5,RYAN>他在跟警局总部打电话协调
<24-5,RYAN>He's on the phone with one P.P. coordinating

<24-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>让他们协助空中补给  是的  长官
<24-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>Have 'em standing by to airlift to the city. Yes, sir.

672
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,990
<24-7,BECKETT>我们在她家中发现她的手机
<24-7,BECKETT>We found her phone at the house.

<24-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>-私家车停在前面  -就是说没法追踪她
<24-8,AGENT MARK FALLON>- The family car is out in front. - So we have no way to trace her.

674
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,320
<24-9,ESPOSITO>我有发现  根据国防部消息
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Yo. I got something. According to D.O.D.,

675
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,820
<24-9,ESPOSITO>跟拉福德在一个分队的人大多数还在部队里
<24-9,ESPOSITO>most of the guys in Radford's unit are still deployed.

676
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,050
<24-9,ESPOSITO>我找到了所有人  除了这两位
<24-9,ESPOSITO>I was able to locate all but two--

677

<24-9,ESPOSITO>伊凡·鲍尔和杰克·科克伦
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Evan Bauer and Jack Cochran.

<24-10,BECKETT>-钓鱼度假了  -他俩什么情况
<24-10,BECKETT>- since last week. - What do we know about them?

680
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,570
<24-11,ESPOSITO>鲍尔是武器专家
<24-11,ESPOSITO>Well, Bauer is a weapons specialist,

681
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,370
<24-11,ESPOSITO>科克伦则擅长爆炸品处理
<24-11,ESPOSITO>and Cochran did a tour in explosive ordinance disposal.

682
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,320
<24-12,RYAN>国防部的人自然懂得如何组装炸弹
<24-12,RYAN>An D.O.D. guy would know how to build a bomb.

683
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,620
<24-12,RYAN>那好  马上组织人手
<24-12,RYAN>All right. Get a team together.

684
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,050
<24-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>用显微镜给我查清这两个人的底细
<24-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>Crawl up these guys' asses with a microscope.

685

<24-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>电话记录  经济收支等等  找到他俩
<24-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>Phone records, financials, anything--get a location.

686
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,950
<24-15,CASTLE>怎么了
<24-15,CASTLE>What's wrong?

687
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,960
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们找到这些人  你猜我们会看到什么
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>We find these guys, you know what we're gonna see?

688
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,500
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>什么都看不到
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>Nothing.

689
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,090
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>这些可不是还拿着学生签证的
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>These aren't brainwashed radicalized kids

690
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,110
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>被洗了脑的激进分子
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>on a student visa.

691
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,680
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>他们是受过严格训练的军人
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>This is highly trained military.

692
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,960
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>他们很可能早猜到我们的行动计划
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>They're probably reading out of our playbook.

693
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,230
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们没时间了
<24-16,AGENT MARK FALLON>We are running out of time.

694
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,330
<24-17,AGENT>让核应急支援小组在空中待命
<24-17,AGENT>Get N.E.S.T. in the air.

695
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:35,860
<24-17,AGENT>是  长官
<24-17,AGENT>Yes, sir.

696
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,150
<24-18,AGENT MARK FALLON>也许我们会有好运气
<24-18,AGENT MARK FALLON>Maybe we'll get lucky,

697
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,760
<24-18,AGENT MARK FALLON>地面行动小组能有所进展
<24-18,AGENT MARK FALLON>The ground teams can make a move.

698
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,640
<24-19,CASTLE>还有...
<24-19,CASTLE>There, uh...

699
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,560
<24-19,CASTLE>也许还有别的办法
<24-19,CASTLE>There might be another way.

700
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,310
<24-19,CASTLE>但...
<24-19,CASTLE>But, uh...

701
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,550
<24-19,CASTLE>我觉得你不会喜欢的
<24-19,CASTLE>I don't think you're gonna like it.

702
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,940
<24-20,AGENT MARK FALLON>打电话去
<24-20,AGENT MARK FALLON>Make the call.

703
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,160
<25-1,EVAN BAUER>很简单  照我们说的做  每个人都能活
<25-1,EVAN BAUER>It's really very simple. Do what we ask, everybody lives.

704
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,140
<25-1,EVAN BAUER>不照我们说的做  每个人都得死
<25-1,EVAN BAUER>Don't do what we ask, everybody dies.

705
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,270
<25-2,NAZIHAH>-就这么简单  -你杀了我丈夫
<25-2,NAZIHAH>- It's as easy as that. - You killed my husband.

706
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,400
<25-2,NAZIHAH>我为什么要相信你
<25-2,NAZIHAH>Why should I believe you?

707
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,200
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>因为你别无选择
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>Because I'm afraid you have no other choice.

708
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,050
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>看见那辆面包车了吗
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>See the van?

709
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,360
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>你要做的就是驾驶它开到我们要求的地点
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>All you gotta do is drive it where we said,

710
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,060
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>停车  离开
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>park it, and walk away.

711
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,330
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>你照做  我们就把你的孩子还给你
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>You do that for us, we'll return your baby,

712
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,100
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>我们就可以继续彼此的生活
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>and we can all go on with our lives.

713
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,140
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>但是你要知道  驾驶座位旁有一个摄像机
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>But you should know, there's a camera on the driver's side.

714
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,480
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>如果你敢做什么蠢事  我们会知道的
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>If you do anything stupid, we'll know.

715
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,790
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>听明白了  就点点头
<25-3,EVAN BAUER>Nod if you understand.

716
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,040
<26-1,FARIQ YUSEF>卡塞尔先生
<26-1,FARIQ YUSEF>Mr. Castle.

717
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,450
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>贝克特探长
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>Detective Beckett.

718
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,200
<26-1,FARIQ YUSEF>很高兴再次见到你们
<26-1,FARIQ YUSEF>So good to see you again.

719
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,850
<26-1,FARIQ YUSEF>法伦探员  久闻您的大名
<26-1,FARIQ YUSEF>And, Agent Fallon, your reputation precedes you.

720
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,400
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>叙利亚领事馆知道你在这儿吗
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>Does the Syrian consulate even know you're here?

721
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,630
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>上次我们见面的时候
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>When last we met,

722
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,470
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>贝克特探长  你拿走了我的手枪
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>Detective Beckett, you relieved me of my pistol.

723
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,990
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>我认为现在是把枪还给我的最好时机
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>I thought now was a good time to retrieve it.

724
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,720
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>尤瑟夫  上次我们见面的时候
<26-3,FARIQ YUSEF>Mr. Yusef, when we last met,

725
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,120
<27-1,CASTLE>你告诉我保持消息灵通是你的工作
<27-1,CASTLE>You told me it was in your business to stay informed.

726
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,950
<27-2,FARIQ YUSEF>就我的工作而言  我认为...
<27-2,FARIQ YUSEF>I find, in my business, it's important to...

727
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,030
<27-2,FARIQ YUSEF>知晓时事是很重要的
<27-2,FARIQ YUSEF>keep up with current events.

728
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,430
<27-3,CASTLE>我肯定你的国家
<27-3,CASTLE>And I'm sure that your country

729
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,450
<27-3,CASTLE>会尽其全力
<27-3,CASTLE>would do everything in its power

730
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,020
<27-3,CASTLE>避免后果严重的误会的产生
<27-3,CASTLE>to avoid a terrible misunderstanding.

731
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,050
<27-3,CASTLE>如果因为未知原因阿米尔和他的妻子纳兹哈
<27-3,CASTLE>If somehow Amir or his wife Nazihah

732
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,450
<27-3,CASTLE>被错误地认为卷入了一场
<27-3,CASTLE>were mistakenly believed to be involved

733
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,190
<27-3,CASTLE>国内恐怖主义行动
<27-3,CASTLE>in an act of domestic terrorism.

734
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,750
<27-4,FARIQ YUSEF>我得说  这是你我共同关心的事
<27-4,FARIQ YUSEF>I would say, it's in both our interests.

735
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,530
<27-5,CASTLE>你也提到了阿米尔得到了你的特别关注
<27-5,CASTLE>You also mentioned that Amir was of special interest to you.

736
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,030
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>我们叙利亚领事馆的人
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>We at the Syrian consulate

737
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,060
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>想要确认他喜欢自己的新家
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>wanted to make sure he liked his new home,

738
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,310
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>没错
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>So, yes.

739
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:58,760
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>我们时不时地会和他见面
<27-6,FARIQ YUSEF>we checked in with him from time to time.

740
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,880
<27-7,BECKETT>那纳兹哈呢  你们会和她见面吗
<27-7,BECKETT>And what about Nazihah, did you check in on her?

741
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,070
<27-8,FARIQ YUSEF>在这种情况下  我们认为去传达我们的悼念
<27-8,FARIQ YUSEF>Under the circumstances, we thought it would be appropriate

742
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,440
<27-8,FARIQ YUSEF>是合乎情理的事
<27-8,FARIQ YUSEF>to send our condolences.

743
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,360
<27-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>你们监视她了  对吧
<27-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>You had her under surveillance, didn't you?

744
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,980
<27-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>她在哪
<27-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where is she?

745
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,010
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>法伦先生  叙利亚领事馆
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>Mr. Fallon, the Syrian consulate

746
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,910
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>是一个严格遵守外交使命的机构
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>is strictly a diplomatic mission.

747
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,800
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>我们当然不会
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>We're certainly not

748
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,920
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>做出监视美国公民这种事
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>in the business of spying on U.S. citizens.

749
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,710
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>然而
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>However...

750
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,180
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>如果你们刚好去了第158街和富兰克林大街交口
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>if you were to happen by a red brick industrial building

751
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,390
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>的那栋红砖工厂厂房
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>on the corner of 158th street and Franklin,

752
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,780
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>我认为你们不会空手而归的
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>I do not think you'd be wasting your time.

753
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,010
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>现在请原谅  我要失陪了
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>Now if you'll excuse me,

754
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,060
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>我在城外有事情要办
<27-10,FARIQ YUSEF>I have an appointment outside the city.

755
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,710
<28-2,SWAT>是她的孩子
<28-2,SWAT>That's her baby.

756
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,730
<28-3,BECKETT>孩子没事
<28-3,BECKETT>The baby's fine.

757
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,160
<28-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>纳兹哈在哪
<28-4,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where's Nazihah?

758
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,810
<28-5,CASTLE>伙计们  看那儿
<28-5,CASTLE>Guys, over here.

759
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,430
<29-1,BECKETT>摄像机角度太小  我们无法得知她在哪
<29-1,BECKETT>Camera frame is too tight. We can't tell where she is.

760
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,430
<29-2,CASTLE>没办法联系上她
<29-2,CASTLE>No way to get in touch with her,

761
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,930
<29-2,CASTLE>好让她知道她孩子安全了
<29-2,CASTLE>and let her know her baby's all right.

762
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,910
<29-3,BECKETT>我想我们得指望他了
<29-3,BECKETT>Well, I guess it's all up to him.

763
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,360
<29-4,CASTLE>他知道我们有截止时间  是吧
<29-4,CASTLE>He knows we're on a deadline, right?

764
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,180
<29-5,BECKETT>-他知道  -我是说字面意思
<29-5,BECKETT>- Yeah, he knows. - I mean a literal deadline.

766
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,500
<29-6,CASTLE>就是说如果过了时间  就死了
<29-6,CASTLE>As in, you go over the line, you're dead.

767
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,020
<29-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你就不能给他个机会吗
<29-7,BECKETT>Castle, can you just give him a chance?

768
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,000
<29-8,CASTLE>我愿意给他任何他想要的东西
<29-8,CASTLE>I-I'm happy to give him anything he needs.

769
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,300
<29-8,CASTLE>-是时间不等人  -通知所有小分队
<29-8,CASTLE>- It's the clock that's not cooperating. - Alert all units.

770
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,130
<29-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>目标开着一辆黑色面包车  重复  黑色面包车
<29-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Target is in a black van. Repeat, a black van.

771
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,800
<29-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>她十分钟前去了时代广场
<29-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>They left for Times Square ten minutes ago.

772
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,810
<29-10,CASTLE>他们怎么开的口
<29-10,CASTLE>How'd you get 'em to talk?

773
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,470
<29-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>我骗了他们
<29-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>I lied.

774
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,540
<29-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>我说拉福德达成了协议  指控他俩
<29-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>I told 'em Radford cut a deal implicating them both.

775
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,980
<29-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>我要在时代广场设检查站和路障
<29-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>I want checkpoints and barricades in Times Square.

776
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,560
<30-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>让直升机在空中搜寻  找到那辆面包车
<30-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Get choppers in the air. Find that van.

777
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,650
<30-2,CASTLE>她十分钟前离开的话
<30-2,CASTLE>If she just left ten minutes ago,

778
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,560
<30-2,CASTLE>我们有机会在她没抵达之前
<30-2,CASTLE>There's a chance we can catch her

779
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,840
<30-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>-找到她  -走百老汇大街或是河道街
<30-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>- before she gets there. - Take Broadway or riverside.

780
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,210
<30-4,BECKETT>我们走百老汇大街
<30-4,BECKETT>We got Broadway.

781
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,230
<30-4,BECKETT>你不应该走百老汇大街
<30-4,BECKETT>You should not have taken Broadway.

782
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,050
<31-1,BECKETT>那是去市中心最直接的路线
<31-1,BECKETT>It's the most direct route to midtown.

783
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,910
<31-2,CASTLE>是啊  但那不是最快的路线  我们应该...
<31-2,CASTLE>Yeah, but it's not the fastest. We should cut over to--

784
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,300
<31-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  求你别指挥我开车行吗
<31-3,BECKETT>Castle, will you please stop telling me how to drive?

785
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,270
<31-4,CASTLE>我没有在指挥你...
<31-4,CASTLE>I'm not telling you how to drive--

786
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,500
<31-5,BECKETT>你就是在指挥我怎么开
<31-5,BECKETT>You are telling me how to drive.

787
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,810
<31-6,CASTLE>纳兹哈的丈夫是的哥
<31-6,CASTLE>Nazihah's husband was a cabbie.

788
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,490
<31-7,BECKETT>那又怎样
<31-7,BECKETT>So?

789
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,720
<31-8,CASTLE>百老汇大街在去市中心经过70几号街时交通堵塞
<31-8,CASTLE>So Broadway slows down in the 70s through midtown.

790
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,080
<31-8,CASTLE>她会知道最快的路线是走西区大街转11街
<31-8,CASTLE>She would know that the fastest way is west end to 11th

791
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,730
<31-8,CASTLE>然后在第48街穿城而过
<31-8,CASTLE>and then cut crosstown on 48th.

792
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,380
<31-9,BECKETT>为什么走第48街不走第46街
<31-9,BECKETT>Okay, why 48th and not 46th?

793
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,200
<31-10,CASTLE>因为第46街在施工  在这儿转弯
<31-10,CASTLE>Because 46th has construction on it. Turn here.

<31-11,HELICOPTER>I repeat, southbound on Broadway, passing 72nd.

<33-10,BECKETT>Well, we were just doing our job.

852
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,410
<33-10,BECKETT>实际上  我是在做本职工作  完全
<33-10,BECKETT>Actually, I was doing my job. I don't know

00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,670
<33-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>听着
<33-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>Listen, um...

855
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,590
<33-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>我所做的事情并不代表我就是那样的人
<33-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>what I do is not who I am.

856
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,690
<33-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>只是我不得不那样
<33-12,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's just how I have to be.

<33-13,BECKETT>and that we hope that we don't have to do it again?

860
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,690
<33-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>有道理
<33-14,AGENT MARK FALLON>Fair enough.

861
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,630
<33-15,CASTLE>不过如果这样的事又发生了
<33-15,CASTLE>I-if it does happen again, though,

862
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,270
<33-15,CASTLE>或许你可以给我发个短信  来个密语
<33-15,CASTLE>maybe you could just text me, have a code word.
