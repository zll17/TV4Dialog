<4-11,CASTLE>你是指她很单纯

<4-12,TEDDY FARROW>她是颗冉冉升起的新星
<4-12,TEDDY FARROW>She was a rising star,

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,550
<4-12,TEDDY FARROW>但她还没准备好
<4-12,TEDDY FARROW>But she wasn't ready for what was coming her way.

<4-13,BECKETT>什么意思
<4-13,BECKETT>What do you mean?

125
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,040
<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>我是指  我想让她成为这一季

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,750
<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>广告大片的女主角
<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>The face of my campaign.

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,070
<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>意味着硬照  杂志

<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>时代广场的广告牌  《旅行周刊》

129
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,180
<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>更不用提大笔的收入
<4-15,TEDDY FARROW>Not to mention a very generous paycheck.

130
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,790
<4-16,CASTLE>对一个天真的女孩来说  这些挺不错的
<4-16,CASTLE>Seems to be all pret heady stuff for a naive young girl.

131
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,690
<4-17,TEDDY FARROW>最近几周她很情绪化  有点多疑
<4-17,TEDDY FARROW>In recent weeks, she'd become so bad tempered, uh, paranoid.

132
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,160
<4-17,TEDDY FARROW>我开始怀疑在重要广告大片上
<4-17,TEDDY FARROW>I'd started to wonder if she wasn't too inexperienced

133
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,470
<4-17,TEDDY FARROW>她是否经验过少
<4-17,TEDDY FARROW>For a major campaign.

<4-18,BECKETT>你说她有点多疑

<4-18,BECKETT>-有没有可能是吸毒了  -她不会
<4-18,BECKETT>- Any chance She was doing drugs? - Not her style.

<4-25,TEDDY FARROW>塞拉就在那里  穿婚纱的那个
<4-25,TEDDY FARROW>That's Sierra there, with the wedding gown.

<4-25,TEDDY FARROW>我得去处理最后一些细节了
<4-25,TEDDY FARROW>Now I really must take care of last-minute details.

148
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,890
<4-26,CASTLE>最后一个问题

153
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,700
<4-27,TEDDY FARROW>她的礼服可是独一无二的一件
<4-27,TEDDY FARROW>The dress she was wearing was a one of a kind.

154
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,800
<4-27,TEDDY FARROW>希望你们能还给我
<4-27,TEDDY FARROW>I don't suppose We can have it returned.

155
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,690
<4-28,BECKETT>现在是证据

00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,020
<4-45,SIERRA>这件婚纱本来是她穿的
<4-45,SIERRA>And I'm wearing her gown.

181
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,480
<4-45,SIERRA>她才是压轴出场的  而非我
<4-45,SIERRA>She was supposed to close the show today, not me.

182
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,340
<4-45,SIERRA>我今早给她打了无数个电话
<4-45,SIERRA>I called her this morning like a million times,

183
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,980
<4-45,SIERRA>但都转到了语音信箱
<4-45,SIERRA>But it just kept going to voice mail.

184
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,830
<4-46,BECKETT>詹娜是几点离开派对的
<4-46,BECKETT>When did Jenna leave the party

185
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
<4-47,SIERRA>大概午夜
<4-47,SIERRA>Uh, around midnight.

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,670
<4-47,SIERRA>我以为她回家了
<4-47,SIERRA>I assumed she was going home.

187
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,230
<4-48,BECKETT>法罗先生提到她最近很烦躁
<4-48,BECKETT>Mr. Farrow mentioned that She seemed agitated lately.

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,560
<4-49,SIERRA>詹娜够格  但她有点紧张
<4-49,SIERRA>Jenna was up for the job, and she was a little tense.

190
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,110
<4-49,SIERRA>-但她没理由紧张  -为什么
<4-49,SIERRA>- But she didn't have any reason to be. - Why not?

191
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,280
<4-51,SIERRA>已经定下就是她了  詹娜是泰迪的最爱
<4-51,SIERRA>She was a lock. Jenna was Teddy' s favorite.

192
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,520
<4-51,SIERRA>天啊
<4-51,SIERRA>Oh, god.

193
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,910
<4-51,SIERRA>特拉维斯知道吗
<4-51,SIERRA>Does travis know?

194
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,410
<4-51,SIERRA>她的丈夫  他会崩溃的
<4-51,SIERRA>Her husband? He's gonna be devastated.

195
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,420
<4-51,SIERRA>他们非常相爱
<4-51,SIERRA>They were so in love.

196
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,970
<4-51,SIERRA>我11点睡的觉
<4-51,SIERRA>I went to bed around 11:00.

197
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,620
<5-1,TRAVIS>我想她回家后会叫醒我
<5-1,TRAVIS>I figured she'd wake me when she got in.

198
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,930
<5-1,TRAVIS>但凌晨3点  她还没回来
<5-1,TRAVIS>But at 3:00 a.m., She wasn't home.

199
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,360
<5-1,TRAVIS>所以我打了她电话
<5-1,TRAVIS>So...  I called her cell phone.

200
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,700
<5-1,TRAVIS>没人接
<5-1,TRAVIS>She wasn't there.

201
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,670
<5-1,TRAVIS>我随即报了警
<5-1,TRAVIS>I called the cops.

202
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,800
<5-1,TRAVIS>他们说我要等48小时
<5-1,TRAVIS>They said I had to wait 48 hours

203
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,850
<5-1,TRAVIS>才能报失踪
<5-1,TRAVIS>Till I could Report her missing.

204
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,100
<5-1,TRAVIS>我说  你们不了解我妻子
<5-1,TRAVIS>I told them, "You don't know my wife.

205
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,530
<5-1,TRAVIS>这么晚她都没回来  一定是出事了
<5-1,TRAVIS>If she's not home by now, something happened to her."

206
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,700
<5-1,TRAVIS>天啊  我应该去那儿的
<5-1,TRAVIS>God, I should've been there.

207
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,820
<5-1,TRAVIS>那些派对  他们
<5-1,TRAVIS>These parties, you know, they're just--

208
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,550
<5-1,TRAVIS>每个人都那么虚伪
<5-1,TRAVIS>Everyone's so phony.

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,790
<5-2,BECKETT>特拉维斯  我懂这很困难
<5-2,BECKETT>Travis, I know this is difficult,

210
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,980
<5-2,BECKETT>但这个问题我还是得问
<5-2,BECKETT>But I have to ask you this question.

211
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
<5-2,BECKETT>你想想有谁
<5-2,BECKETT>Was there anyone that you can think of

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,000
<5-2,BECKETT>会伤害詹娜
<5-2,BECKETT>That would want to do harm to Jenna?

213
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,940
<5-3,TRAVIS>你是在说笑吗
<5-3,TRAVIS>You're kidding, right?

214
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,620
<5-3,TRAVIS>我们报案了
<5-3,TRAVIS>We--we--we filed the reports.

215
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,230
<5-3,TRAVIS>其他警察还没交给你们吗
<5-3,TRAVIS>Did--didn't the other cops send 'em to yoguys?

216
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,340
<5-4,CASTLE>-报案  -她被人骚扰
<5-4,CASTLE>- Reports? - For harassment.

217
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,040
<5-5,TRAVIS>有人一直给詹娜寄信
<5-5,TRAVIS>Some guy was sending Jenna letters.

218
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,780
<5-5,TRAVIS>写一堆恶心的话
<5-5,TRAVIS>Like, writing all sorts of sick things.

219
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,740
<5-5,TRAVIS>还偷拍她
<5-5,TRAVIS>He was taking pictures of her, too.

220
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,580
<5-5,TRAVIS>好像一直在跟踪我们
<5-5,TRAVIS>It's like was watching us all the time.

221
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,270
<5-5,TRAVIS>她被吓坏了  我们俩都被吓坏了
<5-5,TRAVIS>She was falling apart. I mean, we both were.

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,770
<5-5,TRAVIS>我们差点就要搬走了
<5-5,TRAVIS>Hell, We almost moved back home.

223
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,220
<5-6,BECKETT>你们报案了是吗
<5-6,BECKETT>And you filed a report?

224
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,990
<5-7,TRAVIS>对  报了好几次
<5-7,TRAVIS>Yeah, a dozen of 'em.

225
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,560
<5-7,TRAVIS>而你们这些人  每次都说同样的话
<5-7,TRAVIS>And every time, you people said the same damn thing.

226
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,460
<5-7,TRAVIS>这里是纽约
<5-7,TRAVIS>That this is new york,

227
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,090
<5-7,TRAVIS>你们有更重要的事去做
<5-7,TRAVIS>And you got more important things to do

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,090
<5-7,TRAVIS>没空去查什么疯狂粉丝
<5-7,TRAVIS>Than to track down some annoying fan.

229
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,200
<5-7,TRAVIS>那她现在死了
<5-7,TRAVIS>And now she's dead.

230
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,510
<5-7,TRAVIS>我的妻子  死了
<5-7,TRAVIS>My wife... Is dead.

231
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,720
<6-1,RYAN>信是从苏豪区邮局寄出的
<6-1,RYAN>Letters were mailed from the soho post office.

232
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,790
<6-1,RYAN>没回信地址  没签名
<6-1,RYAN>No return address, no signature.

233
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,910
<6-2,ESPOSITO>那个匿名跟踪者没写
<6-2,ESPOSITO>So the anonymous stalker didn't

234
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,970
<6-2,ESPOSITO>自己的名字和电话号码
<6-2,ESPOSITO>Write down his name and number?

235
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,120
<6-3,RYAN>正如我所说
<6-3,RYAN>Yeah, I'm just sayin'.

236
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,400
<6-4,CASTLE>今天我在地铁上看到你了  你看到我了吗
<6-4,CASTLE>"I saw you today in the subway. Did you see me?

237
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,040
<6-5,ESPOSITO>-我真想吃掉你  -这些够恶心了
<6-5,ESPOSITO>- I wanted to taste you." - That's pretty sick stuff.

238
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,250
<6-6,BECKETT>但因为他没直接威胁他们
<6-6,BECKETT>But he doesn't make any direct threats.

239
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,510
<6-6,BECKETT>所以詹娜和特拉维斯没能
<6-6,BECKETT>That's why Jenna and Travis couldn't

240
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,290
<6-6,BECKETT>得到那些同事的认真对待
<6-6,BECKETT>Get the beat cops to take 'em seriously.

241
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,110
<6-7,CASTLE>一对年轻人从小城镇来到大城市
<6-7,CASTLE>Boy, two small town kids go to the big city

242
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,380
<6-7,CASTLE>来实现梦想  而最终结果如斯
<6-7,CASTLE>To follow their dreams, and then this.

243
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,590
<6-7,CASTLE>我确定  这绝不是他们想要的童话结局
<6-7,CASTLE>Not the fairy-tale ending they were looking for, I'm sure.

244
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,540
<6-8,ESPOSITO>为了拍这些照片  他一定去过
<6-8,ESPOSITO>You know, to take these shots, he would've had to have been

245
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,490
<6-8,ESPOSITO>公寓附近的天台
<6-8,ESPOSITO>On a rooftop pretty close to the apartment.

246
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,820
<6-9,BECKETT>难怪她会被吓坏
<6-9,BECKETT>No wonder she was freaked out.

247
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,090
<6-9,BECKETT>查出天台的位置  看是否有线索
<6-9,BECKETT>Find the roof, see if there's anything up there

248
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,590
<6-9,BECKETT>能找出凶手
<6-9,BECKETT>That we can use to identify him.

249
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,420
<6-9,BECKETT>那些同事让詹娜失望了  我们绝不再犯

<7-7,CASTLE>我确定你奶奶一定会有话说

259
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,700

<7-8,ALEXIS>今晚不行
<7-8,ALEXIS>Not tonight she won't.

<7-10,ALEXIS>要了  不过没给她想要的角色
<7-10,ALEXIS>She did. Just not the part she wanted.

264
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,830
<7-10,ALEXIS>制片人说她不适合演主角
<7-10,ALEXIS>The producer said she's not right to play the lead.

<7-22,CASTLE>她说我们在别的地方见过
<7-22,CASTLE>She said we knew each other from... Somewhere.

278
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,500
<7-23,ALEXIS>这是个咒语  无法抗拒
<7-23,ALEXIS>It's a curse, being so irresistible.

<7-39,ALEXIS>世界太小了

306
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,350
<8-5,LANIE>裙子被扯破
<8-5,LANIE>Her dress was torn.

307
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,890
<8-5,LANIE>她脸颊内有伤口  说明
<8-5,LANIE>There's a cut inside of her cheek, indicating that

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,010
<8-5,LANIE>她被人狠狠打了个耳光
<8-5,LANIE>She was slapped, hard.

309
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,730
<8-5,LANIE>但奇怪的是
<8-5,LANIE>But here's the weird part--

310

<8-5,LANIE>刺伤她的凶器又长又尖
<8-5,LANIE>She was stabbed with something long and sharp.

311
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,490
<8-5,LANIE>不是一般刀伤
<8-5,LANIE>It wasn't your typical blade.

312

<8-8,LANIE>凶器是个四面体  顶端较细
<8-8,LANIE>It's 4-sided.  It's slimmer at the tip

315
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,670
<8-8,LANIE>越接近底部越粗
<8-8,LANIE>And gets progressively wider at the base.

<8-14,BECKETT>Get it to c.s.u. See if you can pull any prints.

326
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:49,950
<8-15,ESPOSITO>现在就去

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,410
<8-19,LANIE>用来减肥
<8-19,LANIE>And use it for weight loss.

334
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,120
<8-20,BECKETT>再也不能说她反对吸毒了
<8-20,BECKETT>So much for her being antidrug.

335
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,120
<8-21,CASTLE>我猜不只是工作和跟踪狂
<8-21,CASTLE>I guess the job and the stalker

336
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,380
<8-21,CASTLE>让她紧张
<8-21,CASTLE>Weren't the only things making her tense.

<9-1,BECKETT>你不觉得有人跟踪詹娜很奇怪吗
<9-1,BECKETT>Do you find it odd Jenna had a stalker?

338
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,970
<9-2,CASTLE>不  为什么

<9-3,BECKETT>她的广告大片都还没出来
<9-3,BECKETT>She hadn't even had a national campaign.

341
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,680
<9-4,CASTLE>或许那家伙认为
<9-4,CASTLE>Well, maybe the guy figured

342
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
<9-4,CASTLE>他得提前做好准备
<9-4,CASTLE>He was getting in on the ground floor

<9-7,CASTLE>Fluff? The reporter made you sound like you're

353
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,640
<9-8,BECKETT>没关系

354
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,340
<9-9,CASTLE>那你为什么不开心

<10-8,ESPOSITO>就一张照片  不太像跟踪狂
<10-8,ESPOSITO>A single comp card? That's not very stalkery.

389
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,350
<10-9,CASTLE>怎么没有满墙詹娜的照片
<10-9,CASTLE>Where's the big creepy wall of Jenna?

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,720
<10-16,BECKETT>交给犯罪现场部门  看能否恢复里面的照片
<10-16,BECKETT>Get it to C.S.U. See if they can recover the photos.

397
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,300
<10-17,CASTLE>如果这家伙真的迷恋詹娜
<10-17,CASTLE>If this guy had a thing for Jenna,

398
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,360
<10-17,CASTLE>那他还真表现得不太明显
<10-17,CASTLE>He sure was subtle about it.

399
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,320
<10-18,ESPOSITO>知道什么是名片照吗
<10-18,ESPOSITO>Did you know What a comp card is?

00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,910
<11-1,BECKETT>我们有证据证明你曾到过她家对面的天台
<11-1,BECKETT>We can place you on the rooftop of the building across from hers,

404
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,970
<11-1,BECKETT>如果你不是去偷拍她  那你在那里干什么
<11-1,BECKETT>So if you weren't taking photos, what were you doing there?

405
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,130
<11-2,WILL JAMES>我没有杀她
<11-2,WILL JAMES>I didn't kill her, all right?

406
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
<11-2,WILL JAMES>星期天我根本不在这里  我去上班了
<11-2,WILL JAMES>I wasn't even here sunday.  I was workin'.

407
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,940
<11-3,BECKETT>你说过了  在亚特兰大的赌场
<11-3,BECKETT>Right, at the Casino over in Atlantic city.

408
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,320
<11-3,BECKETT>别担心  我们会查清楚的
<11-3,BECKETT>Don't worry. We're running it down now.

409
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,170
<11-3,BECKETT>与此同时  希望你能解释
<11-3,BECKETT>In the meantime, maybe you can explain

410
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,440
<11-3,BECKETT>为什么这个会出现在你家里
<11-3,BECKETT>How this got in your apartment.

411
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,570
<11-4,WILL JAMES>有漂亮妞的照片不犯法吧
<11-4,WILL JAMES>Having pictures of hot chicks is not a crime.

412
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,890
<11-5,CASTLE>没错  但给她写恐吓信就犯法了
<11-5,CASTLE>No, but sending them threatening letters is.

413
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,760
<11-6,CASTLE>请允许我念一下  今天你的妆太浓了
<11-6,CASTLE>If I may... "You were wearing a lot of makeup today.

414
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,440
<11-6,CASTLE>让你看起来像个荡妇
<11-6,CASTLE>It made you look like a slut."

415
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,610
<11-7,WILL JAMES>你们认为是我写的吗
<11-7,WILL JAMES>Oh, you guys think I wrote that?

416
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,340
<11-8,CASTLE>这家伙可真老练
<11-8,CASTLE>That guy is aptly named.

417
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,070
<11-8,CASTLE>他让我神经紧张
<11-8,CASTLE>He gives me the willies.

418
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,350
<11-9,RYAN>我们遇到问题了
<11-9,RYAN>We have a problem.

419
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,080
<11-9,RYAN>他的不在场证明是真的
<11-9,RYAN>His alibi checks out.

420
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,400
<11-10,BECKETT>你在跟我开玩笑吧
<11-10,BECKETT>You gotta be kidding me.

421
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,300
<11-11,RYAN>和赌场经理确认过了
<11-11,RYAN>Talked to the manager at the casino where he works.

422
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,750
<11-12,ESPOSITO>他说案发当晚威尔·詹姆士一直在那里
<11-12,ESPOSITO>Says that Will James was there the night the girl was killed.

423
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,300
<11-13,BECKETT>一定是哪里出了错
<11-13,BECKETT>There's gotta be some kind of mistake.

424
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,370
<11-14,CASTLE>可能他和老板关系不错  在帮他撒谎
<11-14,CASTLE>Maybe his boss is in on it, covering for his friend.

425
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,600
<9-18,CASTLE>我也这么想
<9-18,CASTLE>I thought so.

426
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,880
<11-14,CASTLE>所以看了他们送来的监控录像
<11-14,CASTLE>So they sent over the security footage.

427
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,280
<11-15,ESPOSITO>詹姆士一整晚都在代客停车
<11-15,ESPOSITO>James was parking cars all night.

428
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,810
<11-15,ESPOSITO>他不是凶手
<11-15,ESPOSITO>He's not our guy.

429
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,140
<12-1,TRAVIS>好吧  我不太明白
<12-1,TRAVIS>Okay, I don't... I don't understand.

430
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,860
<12-2,BECKETT>我们可以起诉他跟踪罪
<12-2,BECKETT>We're holding him on stalking charges.

431
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,740
<12-2,BECKETT>但他并没有杀害你妻子
<12-2,BECKETT>But he didn't kill her.

432
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,720
<12-3,TRAVIS>但是他写了那些信  拍了那些照片啊
<12-3,TRAVIS>He sent those letters, right? He took the pictures?

433
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,750
<12-4,BECKETT>在犯罪现场部门恢复储存卡里的照片之前
<12-4,BECKETT>We won't know for sure unless C.S.U.

434
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,620
<12-4,BECKETT>我们还无法确定都是他干的
<12-4,BECKETT>Is able to recover files from the camera card.

435
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,480
<12-4,BECKETT>不管是谁  我们都会将他绳之以法
<12-4,BECKETT>Whoever killed Jenna, we will find them.

436
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,820
<12-4,BECKETT>我保证
<12-4,BECKETT>I promise.

437
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,510
<12-5,TRAVIS>好的  我会尽力协助你们
<12-5,TRAVIS>Okay. Just-- Whatever I can do.

438
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,990
<12-6,BECKETT>有件事我们想要弄清楚
<12-6,BECKETT>Well, there is something that we're trying to figure out.

439
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,140
<12-6,BECKETT>法医在詹娜血液中检测出艾德美
<12-6,BECKETT>The medical examiner said that she found Addmair  In Jenna' s blood stream.

440
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,210
<12-6,BECKETT>是一种安非他命
<12-6,BECKETT>It's a type of amphetamine.

441
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,120
<12-7,TRAVIS>不不  詹娜从不吸毒
<12-7,TRAVIS>No. No. Jenna didn't use drugs.

442
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,880
<12-8,CASTLE>但有人说她最近常常精神紧张  异常急躁
<12-8,CASTLE>Some people say that she'd been Acting nervous lately, edgy.

443
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,070
<12-9,TRAVIS>没错  那是因为她压力太大
<12-9,TRAVIS>Sure. That was the stress.

444
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,540
<12-9,TRAVIS>那些恐吓信把她吓坏了
<12-9,TRAVIS>Look, these letters, they really scared her.

445
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,800
<12-9,TRAVIS>她又不想告诉她的同事这些事
<12-9,TRAVIS>She didn't want to tell people at work about 'em.

446
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,170
<12-10,BECKETT>最近她的工作怎么样
<12-10,BECKETT>How were things going for her at work?

447
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,410
<12-10,BECKETT>有没有跟什么人有摩擦
<12-10,BECKETT>Was there anyone she didn't get along with--

448
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,340
<12-10,BECKETT>法罗先生对她怎么样
<12-10,BECKETT>Mr. Farrow perhaps?

449
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,720
<12-11,TRAVIS>不  她很喜欢泰迪
<12-11,TRAVIS>No. Look, she loved Teddy.

450
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
<12-11,TRAVIS>她和所有人都相处得很好
<12-11,TRAVIS>She got along good With everyone.

451
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,590
<12-11,TRAVIS>我不知道  可能是有一个人
<12-11,TRAVIS>I don't know. Maybe this one guy.

452
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,660
<12-11,TRAVIS>是个摄影师  他们吵过架
<12-11,TRAVIS>A photographer. They had a fight.

453
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,450
<12-12,BECKETT>为什么
<12-12,BECKETT>About what?

454
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,990
<12-13,TRAVIS>是那家伙负责替法罗的新一季产品拍照
<12-13,TRAVIS>I guess he was the guy that was gonna shoot The Farrow campaign.

455
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,990
<12-13,TRAVIS>所以他和詹娜上周试拍了一次
<12-13,TRAVIS>So last week, he and Jenna, they did this test shoot.

456
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,130
<12-13,TRAVIS>她回家以后哭得很伤心
<12-13,TRAVIS>She came home crying,

457
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,250
<12-13,TRAVIS>说是她的照片拍得很糟
<12-13,TRAVIS>Said that Her pictures were awful.

458
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,420
<12-13,TRAVIS>她很担心保不住工作
<12-13,TRAVIS>She was worried she wouldn't get the job now.

459
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,110
<12-14,CASTLE>詹娜有说怎么回事吗
<12-14,CASTLE>Did Jenna say What went wrong?

460
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,770
<12-15,TRAVIS>只是说他不喜欢她
<12-15,TRAVIS>She said that he just didn't like her.

461
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,430
<12-15,TRAVIS>说他存心拍得不好搞破坏
<12-15,TRAVIS>He was trying to ruin it for her by making her look bad.

462
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,230
<12-16,BECKETT>你知道这个摄影师的名字吗
<12-16,BECKETT>This photographer-- Do you know his name?

463
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,270
<13-1,BECKETT>门罗先生  你和詹娜之间怎么回事
<13-1,BECKETT>Mr. Monroe, what happened Between you and Jenna?

464
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,180
<13-2,WYATT>詹娜是个好模特  人也不错
<13-2,WYATT>Look, Jenna was a great model and a great girl

465
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,550
<13-2,WYATT>但那天精神不太集中  表现失常
<13-2,WYATT>But that day, She was unfocused, awkward.

466
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,680
<13-2,WYATT>我们谈了一下  解决了矛盾
<13-2,WYATT>We had words, But we resolved our issues.

467
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,590
<13-3,CASTLE>怎么解决的
<13-3,CASTLE>How?

468
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,970
<13-4,WYATT>我答应她有空帮她免费试拍一次
<13-4,WYATT>I agreed to do another test on my time and my dime.

469
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,940
<13-4,WYATT>本该是昨天秀结束后进行的  不过
<13-4,WYATT>We were supposed to meet yesterdayAfter the runway show, but--

470
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,160

<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>It's been a hard week for us here at Teddy Farrow.

<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>我想你们都听说了
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>I'm sure you've heard,

480
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,020
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>周日晚上  我们失去了一位员工
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>We lost one of our own on sunday night.

481
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,450
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>詹娜·麦博伊德过早地离开了这个世界
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>Jenna Mcboyd was taken from this world too soon.

482
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,750
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>尽管我们悼念她的离去
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>But even as we honor her memory,

483
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,980
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>但我想她也希望我们继续努力
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>She would've wanted us to carry on.

484
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,280
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>所以今天我请诸位来到这里
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>And that's why I've invited you here,

<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>To introduce the new face of my collection.

486
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,900
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>她同样才华横溢
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>She's an exciting talent.

<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>相信我们会共创辉煌
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>And together, we shall achieve great things.

488
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,590
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>掌声欢迎塞拉·古德温小姐
<13-10,TEDDY FARROW>I give you Miss Sierra Goodwin.

489
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,480
<13-11,CASTLE>这位塞拉小姐再次代替了好友詹娜
<13-11,CASTLE>This Sierra' s stepping in for her good friend Jenna again.

490
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,000
<13-11,CASTLE>是我看错了还是  她真的看上去很开心
<13-11,CASTLE>Is it just me Or does she look really happy?

491
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,720
<13-11,CASTLE>泰迪说新代言人什么来着
<13-11,CASTLE>What was it that Teddy was saying about his new face?

492
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,840
<13-11,CASTLE>照片会登上所有杂志和时代广场广告牌
<13-11,CASTLE>A picture in every magazine, A billboard in times square,

493
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,880
<13-11,CASTLE>还有丰厚的收入
<13-11,CASTLE>A huge paycheck--

494
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,660
<13-11,CASTLE>绝对值得为之杀人
<13-11,CASTLE>Definitely worth killing for.

495
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,300
<13-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你现在说的是一个女孩
<13-12,BECKETT>Castle, you're talking about one girl

496
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,290
<13-12,BECKETT>为了一份工作而谋杀另一个女孩
<13-12,BECKETT>Murdering another for a job.

497
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,110
<13-13,CASTLE>不仅是工作  是广告大片
<13-13,CASTLE>It's not a job. It's a campaign--

498
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,270
<13-13,CASTLE>简直就是黄金机会  嫉妒就是动机
<13-13,CASTLE>A career-mer-maker--and jealousy's a classic motive.

499
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,210
<13-13,CASTLE>你应该看过那种电影
<13-13,CASTLE>You've seen the films--

500
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,350
<13-13,CASTLE>《天才雷普利》《双生兄弟》  还有
<13-13,CASTLE>"The talented Mr. Ripley," "Dead ringers," and, of course,

501
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,940
<13-13,CASTLE>被低估的经典《美国舞娘》
<13-13,CASTLE>The underrated classic  "showgirls."

502
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,350
<13-14,BECKETT>《美国舞娘》里可没有死人
<13-14,BECKETT>Nobody murdered anyone  In "showgirls."

503
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,620
<13-14,BECKETT>我懂了
<13-14,BECKETT>I hear.

504
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,240
<13-15,CASTLE>塞拉想要成为泰迪的宠儿
<13-15,CASTLE>Sierra wants to be Teddy' s favorite.

505
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,580
<13-15,CASTLE>但她总是屈居第二
<13-15,CASTLE>But she's always second choice.

506
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,790
<13-15,CASTLE>于是塞拉想  要是詹娜消失呢
<13-15,CASTLE>Sierra thinks, What if Jenna was gone?

507
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,300
<13-15,CASTLE>那么我就成了首选
<13-15,CASTLE>Then I'd be number one.

508
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,850
<13-15,CASTLE>那我就能得到想要的一切
<13-15,CASTLE>Then I would finally get Everything that I deserve.

509
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,930
<13-15,CASTLE>是夜  她知道机会来了
<13-15,CASTLE>And then one night, She sees her chance.

510
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,300
<13-15,CASTLE>她把詹娜引到一处安静的地方
<13-15,CASTLE>She lures Jenna somewhere quiet...

511
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,230
<13-15,CASTLE>四处无人
<13-15,CASTLE>Deserted.

512
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,380
<13-15,CASTLE>当詹娜转过身去的刹那  塞拉捅了她
<13-15,CASTLE>And when Jenna turns her back, Sierra stabs her.

513
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,540
<13-16,BECKETT>用她包里的华盛顿纪念碑吗
<13-16,BECKETT>With the statue of the washington monument that she carries in her purse?

514
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,110
<13-17,CASTLE>然后偷走了她的鞋子
<13-17,CASTLE>And then steals her shoes.

515
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,660
<13-18,BECKETT>推理不太严密  但既然来了
<13-18,BECKETT>Not a perfect theory, But we're here anyway.

516
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,610
<13-19,CASTLE>多了解一点塞拉·古德温的情况也无妨
<13-19,CASTLE>So no harm in learning a little bit more About what makes Sierra Goodwin tick.

517
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,070
<13-20,CASTLE>我看到能挖线索的人了
<13-20,CASTLE>And I see just the girl to clue us in.

518
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,750
<13-22,RINA>里克
<13-22,RINA>Rick.

519
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,920
<13-23,CASTLE>您应该称呼我卡塞尔先生
<13-23,CASTLE>Uh, that's Mr. Castle to you,

520
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,320
<13-23,CASTLE>莉娜小姐  这位是贝克特探长
<13-23,CASTLE>Missy Rina, This is detective Beckett.

521
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,880
<13-23,CASTLE>贝克特探长  这是莉娜  曾是我的保姆
<13-23,CASTLE>Detective Beckett, rina. She used to babysit for me.

522
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,190
<13-23,CASTLE>我是说  照顾阿丽克西斯
<13-23,CASTLE>For--I mean Alexis.

523
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,880
<13-24,BECKETT>你挺会保密啊
<13-24,BECKETT>You don't say?

524
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,780
<13-25,CASTLE>事实上  我们是为了詹娜的事来的
<13-25,CASTLE>Actually, we're here About Jenna.

525
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,450
<13-26,RINA>那件事太可怕了
<13-26,RINA>Oh. That was so terrible.

526
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,570
<13-27,CASTLE>对  她和塞拉·古德温真的是闺中密友吗
<13-27,CASTLE>Yeah. Was it true that she and Sierra Goodwin were kinda b.f.f.s?

527
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,150
<13-28,RINA>不能说是闺中密友
<13-28,RINA>I wouldn't say b.f.f.s.

528
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,480
<13-28,RINA>塞拉既是朋友也是对手
<13-28,RINA>Sierra' s more of a frenemy.

529
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,200
<13-30,RINA>-怎么说  -她跟大家都相处得不好
<13-30,RINA>- How so? - She doesn't play well with others.

530
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,630
<13-31,CASTLE>她把别人推下过楼梯吗
<13-31,CASTLE>She ever push anybody down the stairs?

531
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,140
<13-32,RINA>那倒没有  不过干过些蠢事
<13-32,RINA>No. Stupid stuff, really--

532
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,470
<13-32,RINA>故意说错试镜时间
<13-32,RINA>Lying about when a call time is,

533
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,120
<13-32,RINA>在你的内衣里涂上痒痒粉
<13-32,RINA>Itching powder  In your underwear--

534
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,660
<13-32,RINA>等等  还有一次
<13-32,RINA>Wait, and this one time,

535
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
<13-32,RINA>她把一粒减肥药碾碎
<13-32,RINA>She crushed up a diet pill

536
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,650
<13-32,RINA>放进另一个模特的香槟里
<13-32,RINA>And dropped it into another model's champagne

537
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,590
<13-33,BECKETT>你是说她给别人投药
<13-33,BECKETT>You're saying she dosed someone.

538
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,000
<13-34,RINA>那个女孩疯了
<13-34,RINA>The girl got all wired

539
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,200
<13-34,RINA>还当面骂凯文·克莱是个无聊的老混蛋
<13-34,RINA>And called Calvin  Klein a boring, old fart.To his face..

540
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,270
<13-36,BECKETT>谢谢你  莉娜  谢谢你的帮忙
<13-36,BECKETT>Thank you, rina. You've been very helpful.

541
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,050
<13-37,CASTLE>想和我分享一下你的想法吗
<13-37,CASTLE>Got something you want to share with the class?

542
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,430
<13-38,BECKETT>我在想
<13-38,BECKETT>I was just thinking...

543
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,670
<13-38,BECKETT>有可能詹娜根本没有吸毒
<13-38,BECKETT>Maybe Jenna didn't use drugs.

544
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,770
<13-38,BECKETT>可能是塞拉在她的饮料里下了药
<13-38,BECKETT>Maybe Sierra was slipping 'em  Into her drinks

545
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,950
<13-38,BECKETT>让她在泰迪·法罗面前表现得疯癫失常
<13-38,BECKETT>When Teddy Farrow was around to make her seem crazy or paranoid.

546
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,750
<13-39,CASTLE>接下来就到了令人发指的罪行了
<13-39,CASTLE>Now that is an evil deed

547
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,020
<13-39,CASTLE>简直就是《美国舞娘》的特别版情节
<13-39,CASTLE>Worthy of the "showgirls" Special edition.

548
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,330
<13-40,BECKETT>他们俩来这里干什么
<13-40,BECKETT>What are those two doing here?

549
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,600
<14-1,BECKETT>伙计们  有什么发现
<14-1,BECKETT>Okay, guys, What's going on?

550
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,450
<14-2,ESPOSITO>技术部恢复了威尔·詹姆士储存卡的照片
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Tech managed to recover E deleted photos from Will James' memory card.

551
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,200
<14-2,ESPOSITO>他可能不是杀害詹娜的凶手
<14-2,ESPOSITO>He might not have been Jenna' s killer,

552
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,530
<14-2,ESPOSITO>但他肯定就是那个跟踪她的人
<14-2,ESPOSITO>But he was definitely her stalker.

553
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,770
<14-3,BECKETT>你们大老远开车来就为了这事
<14-3,BECKETT>And you drove all the way Down here just to show me this?

554
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,480
<14-4,RYAN>我们以为你现在就想看
<14-4,RYAN>We thought you'd want 'em right away.

555
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,750
<14-5,CASTLE>你们真是想得太周到了
<14-5,CASTLE>That is so thoughtful of you guys.

<14-6,RYAN>-怀念从前的光鲜生活吗  -什么生活
<14-6,RYAN>- You missing the glamorous life? - The what life?

<15-3,ESPOSITO>他供认是塞拉雇他
<15-3,ESPOSITO>He admits Sierra hired him

579
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,530
<15-3,ESPOSITO>去跟踪偷拍詹娜
<15-3,ESPOSITO>To take the stalker photos of Jenna.

580
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,160
<15-3,ESPOSITO>他甚至还帮她写了那些信
<15-3,ESPOSITO>He even helped her write the letters.

581
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,760
<15-3,ESPOSITO>他还承认曾提供艾德美给塞拉
<15-3,ESPOSITO>And he claims he was supplying sierra with Addmair.

582
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,630
<15-4,BECKETT>是她给詹娜下的药
<15-4,BECKETT>She was dosing Jenna.

583
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,780
<15-4,BECKETT>她努力让詹娜在你面前疯疯癫癫
<15-4,BECKETT>She was trying to make her seem paranoid around you.

584
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,140
<15-5,TEDDY FARROW>她为什么要那样做
<15-5,TEDDY FARROW>Why would she do that?

585
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,200
<15-6,CASTLE>为了折磨那对涉世不深的夫妻
<15-6,CASTLE>To prey on the fears of a naive couple,

586
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,200
<15-6,CASTLE>让他们承受不住压力  回俄亥俄
<15-6,CASTLE>Pressure them into moving back to ohio

587
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,960
<15-6,CASTLE>这样塞拉就能取代她了
<15-6,CASTLE>So Sierra could take her place.

588
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,960
<15-7,BECKETT>法罗先生  你有没有听过一句话
<15-7,BECKETT>Mr. Farrow, have you ever heard of the expression,

589
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,670
<15-7,BECKETT>我会为了那份工作去杀人
<15-7,BECKETT>"I would kill for that job"?

590
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,660
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>可她是我的代言人
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>But she was my face-- My face.

591
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,410
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>你知道这对我来说意味着什么吗
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>I mean, have you any idea what this will do to me,

592
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,150
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>只是丑闻而已吗
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>The scandal?

593
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,830
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>这会毁了整个春季系列的
<15-8,TEDDY FARROW>It will taint the entire spring line.

594
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,280
<15-9,BECKETT>法罗先生  詹娜被害
<15-9,BECKETT>A girl is dead, Mr. Farrow.

595
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,500
<15-9,BECKETT>对你来说不值一提吗
<15-9,BECKETT>Does that mean anything to you?

596
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,540
<15-10,TEDDY FARROW>可那并不意味着我的事业要遭受损失
<15-10,TEDDY FARROW>It doesn't mean my business should suffer.

597
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,950
<15-11,BECKETT>只是些衣服而已
<15-11,BECKETT>They're just clothes.

598
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,620
<15-12,TEDDY FARROW>只是些衣服而已  探长
<15-12,TEDDY FARROW>"Just clothes," detective?

599
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,520
<15-12,TEDDY FARROW>衣服代表着文明
<15-12,TEDDY FARROW>Clothes are civilization.

600
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,390
<15-12,TEDDY FARROW>衣服把我们和动物区别开来
<15-12,TEDDY FARROW>Clothes are what separate us from animals.

601
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,340
<15-13,BECKETT>也不尽然吧
<15-13,BECKETT>Not always.

602
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,740
<16-1,BECKETT>她是你唯一的竞争对手
<16-1,BECKETT>She was your only competition.

603
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,170
<16-1,BECKETT>你要把她赶下台
<16-1,BECKETT>You needed her out of the way,

604
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,490
<16-1,BECKETT>你自己年轻的时日也不多了
<16-1,BECKETT>And you were running out of time.

605
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,560
<16-2,SIERRA>不  不  我没有杀她
<16-2,SIERRA>No, no. I didn't kill her.

606
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,720
<16-3,CASTLE>对  你只是给她下药
<16-3,CASTLE>Right. You just drugged her

607
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,170
<16-3,CASTLE>给她寄恐吓信而已
<16-3,CASTLE>And sent her threatening letters.

608
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,770
<16-4,BECKETT>周日凌晨两点你在哪里
<16-4,BECKETT>Where were you at 2:00 a.m. N sunday night?

609
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,520
<16-4,BECKETT>塞拉  你面临一项谋杀的指控
<16-4,BECKETT>Sierra... You are facing a murder charge.

610
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,810
<16-4,BECKETT>如果你知道些什么  现在就说出来
<16-4,BECKETT>If you have something to say, now would be the time.

611
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,640
<16-5,SIERRA>-她去了怀亚特家  -那个摄影师吗
<16-5,SIERRA>- She went to Wyatt' s place. - The photographer?

612
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,480
<16-6,CASTLE>詹娜说怀亚特毁了她的试拍
<16-6,CASTLE>Jenna wasn't just being paranoid when she said

613
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,920
<16-7,SIERRA>并不是她多疑
<16-7,SIERRA>Wyatt sabotaged her photo shoot.

614
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,820
<16-7,SIERRA>-他是故意的  -为什么
<16-7,SIERRA>- He did. - Why?

615
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,300
<16-9,SIERRA>因为詹娜不肯和他上床
<16-9,SIERRA>Because Jenna wouldn't sleep with him.

616
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,830
<16-9,SIERRA>这是女孩们公开的秘密
<16-9,SIERRA>It's like an open secret with the girls.

617
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,930
<16-9,SIERRA>你提供怀亚特想要的  他给你拍精彩瞬间
<16-9,SIERRA>You give Wyatt what he wants, he gives you great shots.

618
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,200
<16-9,SIERRA>如果你不合作  他会毁了你
<16-9,SIERRA>If you don't, he can ruin you.

619
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,440
<16-9,SIERRA>他想和詹娜上床
<16-9,SIERRA>And he wanted Jenna.

620
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,330
<16-10,BECKETT>所以他就让她在保住工作和
<16-10,BECKETT>So he was making her choose

621
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,500
<16-10,BECKETT>忠诚于婚姻之间选一个  真是个好人啊
<16-10,BECKETT>Between her career and her marriage vows? Nice guy.

622
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,680
<16-11,SIERRA>她知道第二次试拍必须得成功
<16-11,SIERRA>She knew the photos from the second test had to be great

623
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,960
<16-11,SIERRA>否则就会丢掉饭碗
<16-11,SIERRA>Or she really would lose the job.

624
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,860
<16-11,SIERRA>她需要他好好拍
<16-11,SIERRA>She needed him to do it right this

625
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,240
<16-12,BECKETT>那周日发生了什么
<16-12,BECKETT>Time. So what's happened on Sunday?

626
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,780
<16-13,SIERRA>她告诉我她制定了一个计划
<16-13,SIERRA>She told me she had a plan.

627
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,760
<16-13,SIERRA>我想她是准备答应怀亚特的要求了
<16-13,SIERRA>I figured she was gonna give Wyatt what he wanted.

628
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,650
<16-13,SIERRA>我跟她说
<16-13,SIERRA>I just told her,

629
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,460
<16-13,SIERRA>这不是什么世界末日
<16-13,SIERRA>"It's not the worst thing in the world, you know.

630
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,720
<16-13,SIERRA>你或许还会觉得欲罢不能  我就是那样
<16-13,SIERRA>You might even like it. I did."

631
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,780
<16-13,SIERRA>那是我最后一次见她
<16-13,SIERRA>That was the last time I saw her alive.

632
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,370
<17-1,ESPOSITO>-贝克特  -什么事
<17-1,ESPOSITO>- Yo, Beckett. - Yeah.

633
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,400
<17-3,ESPOSITO>我们调查了怀亚特·门罗  没有前科
<17-3,ESPOSITO>We just got the rundown on Wyatt Monroe. No priors.

634
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,510
<17-3,ESPOSITO>但我们发现他的公寓正位于
<17-3,ESPOSITO>But turns out his apartment is right next door

635
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,690
<17-3,ESPOSITO>文艺中心旁边
<17-3,ESPOSITO>To the arts center,

636
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,760
<17-3,ESPOSITO>从客厅就能看到
<17-3,ESPOSITO>And his living room overlook

<17-3,ESPOSITO>詹娜遇害的喷泉
<17-3,ESPOSITO>The fountain where Jenna was killed.

638
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,480
<17-4,BECKETT>他就住在案发现场旁边
<17-4,BECKETT>He lives next to the crime scene?

639
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,450
<17-5,RYAN>我们调查了他的不在场证明
<17-5,RYAN>We ran that alibi that he gave you.

640
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,150
<17-5,RYAN>扎克·珀森派对有人看见
<17-5,RYAN>Witnesses at the Zac Posen party said

641
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,300
<17-5,RYAN>他十一点半左右离开
<17-5,RYAN>He left around 11:30.

642
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,220
<17-6,CASTLE>他跟我们说凌晨三点才离开
<17-6,CASTLE>He told us he left at 3:00 a.m.

643
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,740
<17-7,ESPOSITO>还有呢  我们向泰迪·法罗的员工证实
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, there's more. We checked with the Teddy Farrow people.

644
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,820
<17-7,ESPOSITO>他午夜前才赶到那个派对
<17-7,ESPOSITO>They said he got to their party just before midnight.

645
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,420
<17-8,BECKETT>他没说实话
<17-8,BECKETT>He lied to us.

646
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,300
<18-1,WYATT>塞拉被捕真是让我太惊讶了
<18-1,WYATT>I n't tell you how shocked I was when Sierra was arrested.

647
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,210
<18-2,BECKETT>你们俩很熟吗
<18-2,BECKETT>Are you two close?

648
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,120
<18-3,WYATT>不能说很熟吧
<18-3,WYATT>I wouldn't say close, but I did

649
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,450
<18-3,WYATT>我只是和她合作过很多次
<18-3,WYATT>A number of sessions with her.

650
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,630
<18-4,CASTLE>原来如此
<18-4,CASTLE>So we've heard.

651
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,020
<18-4,CASTLE>这儿的视野不错
<18-4,CASTLE>That's a really nice view.

652
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,200
<18-5,WYATT>谢谢
<18-5,WYATT>Thanks.

653
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,170
<18-6,BECKETT>那么我能做些什么  你可以解释一下
<18-6,BECKETT>So how can help? You could tell me why you didn't mention

654
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,650
<18-6,BECKETT>为什么不提及你周日去过法罗的派对
<18-6,BECKETT>Going to the Farrow party on sunday

655
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,890
<18-7,WYATT>大概是一时没想起来
<18-7,WYATT>Night. Must have slipped my mind.

656
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,590
<18-7,WYATT>那可是时装周  我参加了很多派对
<18-7,WYATT>It's fashion week. I go to a lot of parties.

657
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,790
<18-8,WYATT>你在干什么
<18-8,WYATT>What are you doing?

658
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,570
<18-9,CASTLE>别管我
<18-9,CASTLE>Oh, don't mind me.

659
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,300
<18-10,BECKETT>你和詹娜在派对上有说话吗
<18-10,BECKETT>Did you talk to Jenna at the party?

660
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,410
<18-11,WYATT>我想是的  不过只是打了个招呼
<18-11,WYATT>I think I did, but just to say hello.

661
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,970
<18-12,BECKETT>-你没想约她之后来你家吗  -没有
<18-12,BECKETT>- You didn't plan on a rendezvous later on at your place? - No.

662
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,200
<18-14,CASTLE>是吗  那么这些又是什么
<18-14,CASTLE>Oh, really? Then whose are these?

<18-15,CASTLE>是泰迪·法罗借给她的
<18-15,CASTLE>On loan from Teddy Farrow.

665
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,960
<18-16,WYATT>我不知道这是谁的
<18-16,WYATT>I don't know who those belong to.

666
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,820
<18-17,BECKETT>-门罗先生  这是什么奖  -是希洛奖
<18-17,BECKETT>- What is this award, Mr. Monroe?  - It's the hilo.

<18-18,WYATT>卓越摄影师
<18-18,WYATT>"For excellence in editorial photography."

668
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,580
<18-19,BECKETT>貌似少了一个
<18-19,BECKETT>Looks like one of these is missing.

669
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,790
<18-20,BECKETT>门罗先生  这个奖杯在哪里
<18-20,BECKETT>Mr. Monroe, where is it?

670
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,900
<18-21,WYATT>上周  清洁工把它摔地上了
<18-21,WYATT>The cleaning woman, uh, dropped it... Last week.

671
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,580
<18-21,WYATT>摔碎了
<18-21,WYATT>It broke.

672
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,390
<18-22,CASTLE>这和那个华盛顿纪念碑倒挺像
<18-22,CASTLE>You know, it looks just like the washington monument.

673
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,350
<18-23,BECKETT>是这样吗
<18-23,BECKETT>It does, doesn't it?

674
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,600
<18-23,BECKETT>好吧
<18-23,BECKETT>Okay.

675
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,710
<19-1,WYATT>詹娜星期天晚上是去过我家
<19-1,WYATT>Look. Jenna was at my place on sunday night.

676
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,690
<19-1,WYATT>但她走的时候还好好的
<19-1,WYATT>But she was alive when she left.

677
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,510
<19-2,BECKETT>她为什么要去你家
<19-2,BECKETT>Why was she there?

678
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,000
<19-3,WYATT>她在泰迪的派对上遇到我
<19-3,WYATT>She found me at Teddy's party,

679
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,380
<19-3,WYATT>说她改主意了
<19-3,WYATT>Said she had a change of heart,

680
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,370
<19-3,WYATT>提议我们俩从现在开始合作
<19-3,WYATT>Wanted us to work together from now on as a team.

681
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,870
<19-4,CASTLE>而你就以为她在暗示你上她
<19-4,CASTLE>And you assumed that was code for "do me."

682
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,990
<19-5,WYATT>我们约定在我家见面
<19-5,WYATT>We agreed to meet back at my place.

683
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,670
<19-5,WYATT>她如约前来  我们喝了点东西
<19-5,WYATT>She came in, we had a drink,

684
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,190
<19-5,WYATT>在沙发上挺舒服的
<19-5,WYATT>Got comfortable on the couch.

685
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,520
<19-5,WYATT>我想要直奔主题
<19-5,WYATT>I was ready to get down to business,

686
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,160
<19-5,WYATT>可她却想要谈论我们的交易
<19-5,WYATT>But she kept wanting to talk about our deal.

687
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,570
<19-5,WYATT>她是这样说的
<19-5,WYATT>That's what she called it.

688
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,340
<19-5,WYATT>她要我告诉她  到底具体要她做什么
<19-5,WYATT>Said she wanted me to tell her exactly what she had to do

689
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,690
<19-5,WYATT>才能给她好好拍
<19-5,WYATT>To get good shots-- Exactly.

690
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,950
<19-6,BECKETT>她想让你自己说出来作为证据
<19-6,BECKETT>She was trying to get you to incriminate yourself.

691
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,270
<19-7,WYATT>这女孩不去做间谍太可惜了
<19-7,WYATT>A master spy this girl was not.

692
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,840
<19-7,WYATT>我抢过她的钱包  翻出手机
<19-7,WYATT>I grabbed her purse, pulled out her phone.

693
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,890
<19-7,WYATT>那该死的东西摁个钮就可以录音
<19-7,WYATT>Damnhing had an app on it that turned it into a recorder.

694
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,470
<19-7,WYATT>她完整地录下了我们的对话
<19-7,WYATT>She taped our whole conversation.

695
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,100
<19-8,CASTLE>她想录下他要求潜规则的录音
<19-8,CASTLE>She wanted to record him Demanding sex for good shots

696
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,660
<19-8,CASTLE>然后让泰迪·法罗听听
<19-8,CASTLE>So she could play it for Teddy Farrow.

697
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,640
<19-10,WYATT>她又夺回手机  我们扭打起来
<19-10,WYATT>She grabbed the phone back. We struggled.

698
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,320
<19-10,WYATT>她抓过架子上的奖杯
<19-10,WYATT>She picked up my award off the shelf,

699
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,040
<19-10,WYATT>疯狂地到处挥舞
<19-10,WYATT>Started waving it around and acting crazy.

700
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,370
<19-10,WYATT>奖杯撞在书架上  杯顶碰碎了
<19-10,WYATT>She smacked thhilo into a bookshelf. The tip broke off.

701
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,720
<19-11,WYATT>我试图抢过来  却被碎片割伤了
<19-11,WYATT>I tried to grab it. She cut me with the edge.

702
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,120
<19-11,WYATT>所以我放弃了  她就离开了
<19-11,WYATT>So I backed off, and she left.

703
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,980
<19-12,BECKETT>故事很精彩  可我不信
<19-12,BECKETT>You know, that's a great story, but I don't believe you.

704
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,000
<19-13,WYATT>你们听听她的手机录音
<19-13,WYATT>Just listen to the recording on her phone.

705
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,320
<19-13,WYATT>我说的是实话
<19-13,WYATT>I'm telling you the truth.

706
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,780
<19-14,BECKETT>她的包不见了
<19-14,BECKETT>Her purse was never found.

707
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,190
<19-14,BECKETT>看来能够证明你清白的证据
<19-14,BECKETT>So it looks like the evidce that'll clear you

708
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,040
<19-14,BECKETT>已经和你的希洛奖杯一起
<19-14,BECKETT>Is lying in a landfill somewhere

709
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,540
<19-14,BECKETT>被丢到某个垃圾场了
<19-14,BECKETT>Along with your hilo.

710
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,170
<19-14,BECKETT>真是倒霉透顶
<19-14,BECKETT>Tough break.

711
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,990
<20-1,RYAN>模特行业以前可是光环四射
<20-1,RYAN>You know that modeling was glamourous.

712
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,030
<20-2,BECKETT>这个行业也不是所有人都追名逐利
<20-2,BECKETT>Not everybody in that business is predatory.

713
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,040
<20-3,ESPOSITO>可看上去是那样的
<20-3,ESPOSITO>It sure seem that way

714
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,850
<20-3,ESPOSITO>詹娜最好的朋友给她下药
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Jenna's best friend was drugging her,

715
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,850
<20-3,ESPOSITO>她的摄影师谋杀了她
<20-3,ESPOSITO>And her photographer killed her.

716
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,970
<20-4,CASTLE>和她的死比起来  设计师更关心的
<20-4,CASTLE>Even her clothing designer seemed more interested

717
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,010
<20-4,CASTLE>却是时装秀
<20-4,CASTLE>In his show than in her murder.

718
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,210
<20-5,RYAN>不过至少我们还是抓住了凶手  已经很好了
<20-5,RYAN>But at least we got the bad guy. That's something.

719
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:24,990
<20-6,CASTLE>怎么了
<20-6,CASTLE>What?

720
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,760
<20-7,BECKETT>如果是怀亚特杀了她
<20-7,BECKETT>If Wyatt killed her,

721
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,510
<20-7,BECKETT>他为什么不把家里打扫干净
<20-7,BECKETT>Why didn't he do a better job of cleaning up his place?

722
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,030
<20-7,BECKETT>还有  为什么要把她的尸体
<20-7,BECKETT>And why would he leave her body

723
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,190
<20-7,BECKETT>就放在他的公寓门外
<20-7,BECKETT>Right outside of his apartment?

724
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,560
<20-8,ESPOSITO>或许他脑子不那么灵光
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Maybe he's not that bright.

725
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,440
<20-9,BECKETT>抑或是他确实说了实话
<20-9,BECKETT>Or maybe he was telling the truth.

726
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,990
<20-9,BECKETT>说不定不是他干的
<20-9,BECKETT>Maybe he didn't do it.

727
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,830
<21-1,CASTLE>昨日回忆那部戏怎么样了
<21-1,CASTLE>What's up with the stroll down memory Lane?

728
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,160
<21-2,MARTHA>我打过电话给经纪人
<21-2,MARTHA>Oh, I called my agent

729
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,630
<21-2,MARTHA>告诉他不接这部戏了
<21-2,MARTHA>And told him to pass on the play.

730
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,920
<21-2,MARTHA>我说  玛莎·罗杰斯不能在第一幕就死去
<21-2,MARTHA>I said, "martha Rodgers does not die in the first act,

731
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,560
<21-2,MARTHA>更不可能死在台下
<21-2,MARTHA>And she never dies offstage."

732
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,300
<21-3,CASTLE>感觉好点了吗
<21-3,CASTLE>Feel better?

733
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,120
<21-4,MARTHA>没有  感觉我已经老了
<21-4,MARTHA>No, I feel rotten and old.

734
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,250
<21-4,MARTHA>感觉我已经走到了舞台生涯的尽头
<21-4,MARTHA>I feel like I'm dying offstage.

735
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,260
<21-4,MARTHA>我也曾天真无邪  扮演主角  是大明星
<21-4,MARTHA>I was always the ingenue, the lead, the star.

736
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,210
<21-4,MARTHA>我喜欢那样
<21-4,MARTHA>I liked it that way.

737
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,180
<21-4,MARTHA>儿子  青春美丽  才华洋溢
<21-4,MARTHA>It's a powerful thing, kiddo,

738
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,630
<21-4,MARTHA>有种奇妙的魔力
<21-4,MARTHA>To be young, beautiful, talented.

739
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,350
<21-4,MARTHA>是女人都不愿放弃
<21-4,MARTHA>No woman wants to give it up.

740
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,690
<21-5,CASTLE>您依然美丽动人  依然才华洋溢
<21-5,CASTLE>You are still beautiful and you are still talented.

741
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,540
<21-5,CASTLE>你并没有失去青春
<21-5,CASTLE>And you didn't give up your youth.

742
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,660
<21-5,CASTLE>只是用它换来了睿智
<21-5,CASTLE>You traded it for wisdom.

743
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
<21-6,MARTHA>睿智
<21-6,MARTHA>Wisdom.

749
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,670
<21-10,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯都告诉我了
<21-10,MARTHA>Alexis told me all about it.

750
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,310
<21-10,MARTHA>这女孩对你来说太小了
<21-10,MARTHA>At girl is too young for you.

751
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,470
<21-10,MARTHA>或者我该这样说  你跟她比太老
<21-10,MARTHA>Or I should say, you are too old for her.

752
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,180
<21-11,CASTLE>不是你想的那样
<21-11,CASTLE>It is not what you think.

753
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,820
<21-12,MARTHA>失业的女艺人  免费住在玻璃房
<21-12,MARTHA>And unemployed divas who live in glass houses rent free

754
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,190
<21-13,CASTLE>就别说别人了
<21-13,CASTLE>Should not throw stones.

755
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,720
<21-14,MARTHA>说的也对
<21-14,MARTHA>Point taken.

756
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,040
<22-1,CASTLE>有什么好消息吗
<22-1,CASTLE>What's the good word?

757
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,230
<22-2,BECKETT>阳光电子
<22-2,BECKETT>Sunshine electronics.

758
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,590
<22-3,CASTLE>-那是两个词了  -不是
<22-3,CASTLE>- That's two words. - Nope.

759
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,850
<22-4,BECKETT>詹娜·麦博伊德在阳光电子买的新手机
<22-4,BECKETT>That's where Jenna Mcboyd bought her new cell phone.

760
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,360
<22-5,CASTLE>-什么  -昨晚我找她丈夫谈话
<22-5,CASTLE>- What? - So I was talking to her husband last night,

761
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,460
<22-6,BECKETT>我突发奇想  问了点她手机的事
<22-6,BECKETT>And on a hunch, I ask him about her cell phone.

762
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,070
<22-6,BECKETT>他说她那款手机没有录音功能
<22-6,BECKETT>He said it wouldn't accommodate a recording app.

763
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,930
<22-6,BECKETT>然后我查了她的信用卡账单
<22-6,BECKETT>So I checked into her credit card receipts.

764
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,340
<22-6,BECKETT>她遇害当天买了个新手机
<22-6,BECKETT>She bought a new cell phone the day she died,

765
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,070
<22-6,BECKETT>还装有全球定位系统
<22-6,BECKETT>And it had gps in it,

766
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,960
<22-6,BECKETT>她很有预见性  早就打开了
<22-6,BECKETT>Which she had the foresight to switch on.

767
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,200
<22-7,CASTLE>这么说你找到手机了
<22-7,CASTLE>Whoa. You found it?

768
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,230
<22-8,BECKETT>在西区81街的一个垃圾桶里
<22-8,BECKETT>In a dumpster on west 81st.

769
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,560
<22-8,BECKETT>有同事正送来
<22-8,BECKETT>Uniforms are bringing it in now.

770
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,930
<22-9,JENNA>-怀亚特  住手  -把手机给我
<22-9,JENNA>- Stop it, Wyatt! - Give me the phone!

771
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,460
<22-11,CASTLE>至此  一切正如他所说
<22-11,CASTLE>So far it's happening just like he said it did. Mm-hmm.

772
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,980
<22-12,BECKETT>这是他说的  她抢过凶器的时候
<22-12,BECKETT>This is when he said she grabbed the weapon.

773
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,290
<22-14,WYATT>把它给我
<22-14,WYATT>Give that to me!

774
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,570
<22-15,JENNA>离我远点
<22-15,JENNA>Stay away from me.

775
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,810
<22-16,WYATT>小心点那个东西
<22-16,WYATT>Be careful with that thing.

776
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,190
<22-17,WYATT>他妈的
<22-17,WYATT>Damn it.

777
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,320
<22-17,WYATT>我流血了  你这个疯婊子
<22-17,WYATT>I'm bleeding, you crazy bitch.

778
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,140
<22-18,BECKETT>听起来她是活着离开了那里
<22-18,BECKETT>Sounds like she left the place alive.

779
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,540
<22-19,RYAN>但也不代表他没有追出去
<22-19,RYAN>Doesn't mean he didn't go after her.

780
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:56,680
<22-20,ESPOSITO>但是如果他想杀她
<22-20,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but if he was Gonna kill her,

781
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,440
<22-20,ESPOSITO>就不会让她活着离开他的公寓
<22-20,ESPOSITO>He wouldn't t her leave the apartment.

782
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,290
<22-21,CASTLE>还在录音呢
<22-21,CASTLE>Shh. It's still going.

783
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,220
<22-22,JENNA>我得叫辆车  我得离开这里
<22-22,JENNA>I need a cab.I've gotta get outta here.

784
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
<22-22,JENNA>我的天哪  你跟踪我
<22-22,JENNA>Oh, my god! Did you follow me?

<22-22,JENNA>等等  放开我  住手
<22-22,JENNA>Wait. Let go of me. Stop!

786
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,430
<23-1,CASTLE>那么  我们现在怎么办
<23-1,CASTLE>So... What's our plan?

787
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,820
<23-2,BECKETT>让他认罪
<23-2,BECKETT>Make him confess.

788
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,800
<23-3,CASTLE>我觉得他不会老实招供的
<23-3,CASTLE>I don't think he's gonna crack that easy.

789
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,240
<23-3,CASTLE>如果他发现
<23-3,CASTLE>I mean, what if he figures out

790
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,340
<23-3,CASTLE>我们只是有这么一部分录音
<23-3,CASTLE>We only have a partial recording,

791
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,160
<23-3,CASTLE>而且在凶案发生之前手机内存就满了
<23-3,CASTLE>That the memory on the phone ran out before the actual murder took place?

792
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,420
<23-4,BECKETT>他不会发现的
<23-4,BECKETT>He won't.

793
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,940
<23-5,CASTLE>我们没有证据证明他是凶手
<23-5,CASTLE>We, uh, we don't have any proof that he did it.

794
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,680
<23-5,CASTLE>要是他死不承认保持沉默怎么办
<23-5,CASTLE>I mean, what if he shuts down and doesn't talk?

795
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,440
<23-6,BECKETT>他会说的
<23-6,BECKETT>He won't.

796
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,350
<23-7,CASTLE>他可不蠢  他会找一个律师的
<23-7,CASTLE>He's not a stupid man. He might ask for a lawyer.

797
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,620
<23-8,BECKETT>他会招供的  这事我来处理
<23-8,BECKETT>He won't. Look, let me handle this.

798
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,520
<23-8,BECKETT>你想进去的话可以  但是不要说话

00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,040
<24-4,BECKETT>没人会再用他们
<24-4,BECKETT>No one will hire them again.

<24-5,CASTLE>你那是理想化的公道
<24-5,CASTLE>Ah, you mean poetic justice.

896
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,240
<24-7,CASTLE>喝点烈酒  泡个热澡
<24-7,CASTLE>Pour a stiff drink, run a hot bath,

<24-9,CASTLE>但出版商不想让副本流出
<24-9,CASTLE>But my publisher doesn't want any copies leaking out.

901
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,530
<24-10,BECKETT>那怎么让《时尚》的记者读了
<24-10,BECKETT>Why'd you let that "cosmo" reporter read it, then?

902
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,690
<24-11,CASTLE>纯属宣传手段
<24-11,CASTLE>Well, that's for publicity purposes.

<24-11,CASTLE>你明白的  得让媒体先尝点甜头
<24-11,CASTLE>You know, you want the press To have a little taste of...

904
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,900
<24-11,CASTLE>等等  所以你才不高兴吗
<24-11,CASTLE>Wait. Whoa. Is... Is that why you've been so upset,

905
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,410
<24-11,CASTLE>因为我让她先看了那本书
<24-11,CASTLE>Because I let her read it before you?

00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,460
<24-12,BECKETT>我是你的灵感
<24-12,BECKETT>I am the inspiration.

907
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,020
<24-12,BECKETT>先睹为快的应该是我  不是那个记者
<24-12,BECKETT>I should be reading it Before a reporter does.

908
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,310
<24-13,CASTLE>你怎么不直接说
<24-13,CASTLE>Why didn't you just say so?

909
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,480

<24-24,BECKETT>比起做女服务生赚钱更快
<24-24,BECKETT>Would be an easier way to make money Than waitressing.

00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,700
<25-4,MARTHA>我推掉的那出戏
<25-4,MARTHA>The play I passed on?

929
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,790
<25-4,MARTHA>那个制作人给了我一个更好的机会
<25-4,MARTHA>The producers came back with a better offer.

930
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,540
<25-4,MARTHA>我刚在多尔切斯特签了合约
<25-4,MARTHA>I was just at the dorchester signing my contracts.

931
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:35,930
<25-5,CASTLE>所以你是主角了
<25-5,CASTLE>So you got the lead?

00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,700
<25-12,MARTHA>他们重写了剧本  我能死在台上
<25-12,MARTHA>They have rewritten the script So that I die onstage.

<25-12,MARTHA>我的死就是第一幕的结束
<25-12,MARTHA>My death closes act one.

939
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,460
<25-12,MARTHA>这比演主角还要好  真的
<25-12,MARTHA>It's better than the lead, really.

940
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,130
<25-12,MARTHA>奶奶是最出彩的角色
<25-12,MARTHA>Granny's the bravura role.

941

<25-13,CASTLE>真是戏如人生

<25-21,ALEXIS>-你好  -你好
<25-21,ALEXIS>- Hi! - Hey.

00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,740
<25-23,ALEXIS>我完全没问题
<25-23,ALEXIS>I'm so ready.

950
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,060
<25-24,CASTLE>你好  莉娜
<25-24,CASTLE>Hey, Rina.

951
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,620

<25-25,RINA>- Oh, hi, Mr. Castle. - Come on.

<25-27,RINA>天哪  你穿这件T恤真是太可爱了
<25-27,RINA>Oh, my gosh. That shirt  Is so cute on you.

953
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,810
<25-28,CASTLE>对上号了  显然模特的世界里
<25-28,CASTLE>Color me shocked, but apparently the modeling world

954
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,300
<25-28,CASTLE>不只有性感的衣服和有意思的聚会
<25-28,CASTLE>Isn't all sexy clothes and fun parties.

955
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,870
<25-28,CASTLE>我突然想到  如果詹娜·麦博伊德身边
<25-28,CASTLE>It occurred toe that if Jenna Mcboyd had someone

956
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,720
<25-28,CASTLE>有人多关心她一点
<25-28,CASTLE>Looking out for her a little bit,

957
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,260
<25-28,CASTLE>她可能就不会出事了
<25-28,CASTLE>She might still be alive today.

958
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,550
<25-28,CASTLE>所以如果莉娜需要朋友
<25-28,CASTLE>So if Rina needs a friend,

959
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,310
<25-28,CASTLE>很显然她已经有了一个
<25-28,CASTLE>She knows she's got one.

960
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,590
<25-29,MARTHA>我的好儿子  心软耳根子软
<25-29,MARTHA>Oh, my son... The big softie.

961
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,080
<25-29,MARTHA>别担心  我知道你得保护自己的形象
<25-29,MARTHA>And don't worry. I know You have an image to protect.
