55
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,820
<3-15,KEVIN RYAN>国家安全局的人不让我和他们谈话
<3-15,KEVIN RYAN>And Homeland Security isn't letting me talk to them.

56
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,610
<3-16,CASTLE>神秘的汽车炸弹
<3-16,CASTLE>A mysterious car bombing...

57
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,290
<3-16,CASTLE>联邦探员给我们吃闭门羹
<3-16,CASTLE>The Feds giving us the boot,

<3-19,BECKETT>你们为什么要监视那辆车
<3-19,BECKETT>Why were you guys surveilling that car?

65
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,010
<3-19,BECKETT>爆炸时谁在车上

<3-20,BECKETT>没有尸体
<3-20,BECKETT>Well, we don't have a body,

67
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,980
<3-20,BECKETT>没有犯罪现场
<3-20,BECKETT>we don't have a crime scene,

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
<3-20,BECKETT>没有任何目击证人  但是
<3-20,BECKETT>and we don't have any witnesses, but...

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,640
<3-21,CASTLE>至少我们还拥有彼此
<3-21,CASTLE>At least we have each other.

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,410
<3-22,BECKETT>-我们依然有件凶杀案要破  -还有这个
<3-22,BECKETT>- We still have a homicide to solve. - And that.

71
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,870
<3-23,CASTLE>看来知道死者身份了
<3-23,CASTLE>I think I got an I.D. on our vic.

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,060
<3-24,ESPOSITO>警员发现了他的钱包
<3-24,ESPOSITO>A uniform... found his wallet,

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,090
<3-24,ESPOSITO>被炸飞了半条街
<3-24,ESPOSITO>blown about a half a block down that way.

74
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,160
<3-24,ESPOSITO>外貌与目击者看到的
<3-24,ESPOSITO>Matches the description of the guy

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,590
<3-24,ESPOSITO>进入车辆的人相符
<3-24,ESPOSITO>that witnesses saw get in the car.

76
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,490
<3-24,ESPOSITO>死者叫戴尔·坦纳
<3-24,ESPOSITO>His name is Dale Tanner.

77
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,450
<4-1,BETH TANNER>我一直知道会有这一天
<4-1,BETH TANNER>I always knew this day might come.

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,180
<4-1,BETH TANNER>戴尔也知道  这是他工作的危害之一
<4-1,BETH TANNER>Dale did, too. It was one of the hazards of his job.

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,620
<4-2,BECKETT>什么样的工作会导致这种结果
<4-2,BECKETT>What kind of a job would lead to this?

80
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,810
<4-3,BETH>戴尔16岁时
<4-3,BETH>When Dale was 16,

81
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,630
<4-3,BETH>他的父亲在德州被判杀人罪名成立
<4-3,BETH>his father was convicted of murder in Texas--

82
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,080
<4-3,BETH>他父亲是冤枉的
<4-3,BETH>wrongly convicted.

83
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,850
<4-3,BETH>在复审前  他父亲死在了监狱里
<4-3,BETH>Right before the retrial, his father died in prison.

84
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,400
<4-3,BETH>所以为弱势群体而战
<4-3,BETH>And so fighting for the underdog, that...

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,580
<4-3,BETH>成了他的人生目标
<4-3,BETH>kind of became his life's mission.

86
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,970
<4-4,SHAWN TANNER>大约十年前  他创建了一个网站
<4-4,SHAWN TANNER>So about ten years ago he started the web site.

87
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,750
<4-4,SHAWN TANNER>匿名告密者
<4-4,SHAWN TANNER>"Whistleblower anonymous."

88
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,060
<4-5,CASTLE>我知道这个网站
<4-5,CASTLE>I know that site.

89
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,040
<4-5,CASTLE>他曝光了水刑备忘录
<4-5,CASTLE>He exposed the, uh, the waterboarding memos,

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,490
<4-5,CASTLE>还有奥顿公司水力压裂公司丑闻
<4-5,CASTLE>the Orton-geo fracking scandal.

91
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,850
<4-5,CASTLE>我不知道网站的创办人居然是他
<4-5,CASTLE>I had no idea he was the one behind it.

92
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,070
<4-6,BETH>戴尔觉得比起自己的安危
<4-6,BETH>Dale felt it was more important

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,970
<4-6,BETH>让大众一直关注这些问题更重要
<4-6,BETH>to keep attention on the issues rather than himself.

94
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,030
<4-7,CASTLE>你丈夫最近在调查什么吗
<4-7,CASTLE>Was your husband working on anything recently?

95

<4-8,BETH>有  我想他计划公布一些文件
<4-8,BETH>Yeah, I think he was planning on posting some documents.

96
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,270
<4-8,BETH>不管是什么  令他很紧张
<4-8,BETH>Whatever they were, they were making him nervous.

97
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,670
<4-9,BECKETT>文件现在在哪里
<4-9,BECKETT>Where are the documents now?

98
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,840
<4-10,BETH>可能在皇后区他的律师事务所里
<4-10,BETH>Probably at his law office in Queens.

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,620
<4-11,CASTLE>为什么国家安全局的人  对你的丈夫有兴趣
<4-11,CASTLE>Why would Homeland Security be interested in your husband?

100
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,420
<4-12,BETH>政府一半的人都对我的丈夫有兴趣
<4-12,BETH>Half the government was interested in my husband.

101
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,700
<4-12,BETH>他公布了阿布格莱布监狱虐待伊拉克战俘的照片后
<4-12,BETH>After he posted those photographs of Abu Ghraib,

102
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,320
<4-12,BETH>他们就想让他说出信息来源
<4-12,BETH>they... tried to get him to reveal his sources.

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,830
<4-12,BETH>他们骚扰他
<4-12,BETH>They harassed him.

104
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,740
<4-12,BETH>他去哪里都被跟踪
<4-12,BETH>Followed him everywhere he went.

105
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,080
<4-12,BETH>情况糟糕到两个月前
<4-12,BETH>It got so bad that, two months ago,

106

<4-12,BETH>他搬到了我们在皇后区的租赁公寓
<4-12,BETH>he actually moved into our rental unit in Queens.

107
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,660
<4-12,BETH>他说他担心我们的安全问题
<4-12,BETH>He said that he was concerned about our safety.

108
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,220
<4-13,SHAWN>现在他死了
<4-13,SHAWN>And now he's dead.

109

<4-14,BECKETT>坦纳太太
<4-14,BECKETT>Mrs. Tanner,

110

<4-14,BECKETT>目击证人说你丈夫把车停在默瑟街
<4-14,BECKETT>Witnesses say that your husband parked on Mercer

111
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,990
<4-14,BECKETT>就在八点之前
<4-14,BECKETT>just before 8:00.

112
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,560

113
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,670
<4-14,BECKETT>然后回到车上
<4-14,BECKETT>and then he got back in his car.

<4-14,BECKETT>你知道他在市区做什么吗
<4-14,BECKETT>Do you know what he was doing downtown?

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,810
<4-14,BECKETT>不知道
<4-14,BECKETT>I have no idea.

116
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,690
<4-15,BETH>他觉得  我们知道的越少越好
<4-15,BETH>He felt like, the less we knew, the better.

117
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,450
<4-15,BETH>我应该经常找他聊聊的
<4-15,BETH>I should've talked to him more.

<4-16,BECKETT>他有没有同事
<4-16,BECKETT>Did he work with anyone else

119
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,930
<4-16,BECKETT>可能知道他卷入了什么事件
<4-16,BECKETT>that might have known what he was involved in?

120
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,980
<4-17,BETH>他有个搭档

<4-18,SHAWN>The government killed my father,

124

<4-18,SHAWN>你们在帮助政府掩盖事实
<4-18,SHAWN>and you're helping them cover it up.

125
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,510
<4-19,BETH>肖恩  别这样
<4-19,BETH>Sean, please.

126
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,590
<5-1,RYAN>我不会管这种行为叫掩盖事实
<5-1,RYAN>Now I'm not gonna call this a cover-up,

127
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,550
<5-1,RYAN>但我得说  联邦探员可没有帮我们
<5-1,RYAN>but I will say this-- the Feds are not helping us out.

128
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,640
<5-1,RYAN>他们不肯透露在坦纳的车上找到了什么证据
<5-1,RYAN>They won't tell us what evidence they found in Tanner's car.

129
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,320
<5-2,BECKETT>好吧  那我们就换个角度着手
<5-2,BECKETT>Okay. So we'll just work it from other angles.

130
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,490
<5-2,BECKETT>我们知道他有个搭档
<5-2,BECKETT>We know that he had a partner.

131
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,910
<5-2,BECKETT>不如不查查他的手机记录
<5-2,BECKETT>Why don't we look into his phone records,

132
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,720
<5-2,BECKETT>看看是谁
<5-2,BECKETT>see who it was?

133
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,710
<5-3,RYAN>因为我们还不被允许查这个
<5-3,RYAN>Because they're not being released to us.

134
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,390
<5-3,RYAN>坦纳的财务状况也查不到
<5-3,RYAN>Neither are Tanner's financials.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,530
<5-4,BECKETT>也许可以在他的律师事务所查到
<5-4,BECKETT>Maybe we can get it from his law office?

136
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,890
<5-5,RYAN>我们想搜查那里
<5-5,RYAN>We tried to search there.

137
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,000
<5-5,RYAN>他们已经封了办公室  拿走了他的电脑
<5-5,RYAN>They sealed the place and they took his computers.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,760
<5-6,CASTLE>我开始明白你说联邦探员不会帮忙的意思了
<5-6,CASTLE>I'm starting to see what you mean by the feds not helping.

139
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,790
<5-7,BECKETT>那我们只能自己解决这案子  不用他们帮忙
<5-7,BECKETT>Then we're just gonna solve this without their help.

140
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,770
<5-7,BECKETT>动机查的怎么样了
<5-7,BECKETT>Where are we on motive?

141
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,280
<5-8,RYAN>这个倒是不少
<5-8,RYAN>Well, there's plenty of that to go around.

142
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,850
<5-8,RYAN>坦纳不怕得罪大人物
<5-8,RYAN>Tanner wasn't afraid to take on the big boys--

143
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,040
<5-8,RYAN>银行家  石油巨头  腐败的政治家
<5-8,RYAN>Banks, big oil, dirty politicians.

144
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
<5-8,RYAN>去年  他揭露了极具毁灭性
<5-8,RYAN>In the past year, he posted highly damaging,

145
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,290
<5-8,RYAN>我得加一句
<5-8,RYAN>and I might add,

146
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,880
<5-8,RYAN>而且真实的信息  涉及30家企业
<5-8,RYAN>truthful information on 30 corporations,

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,050
<5-8,RYAN>政府部门或个人
<5-8,RYAN>government agencies, and individuals.

148
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,000
<5-8,RYAN>这还是我在他的网站
<5-8,RYAN>And that's just what I found

149
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,120
<5-8,RYAN>被关闭前找到的凤毛麟角
<5-8,RYAN>before his site was taken off-line.

150
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,740
<5-8,RYAN>没有确切的信息
<5-8,RYAN>With no solid information,

151
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,510
<5-8,RYAN>我们根本无法入手
<5-8,RYAN>it's hard to even know where to start.

152
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,530
<5-9,BECKETT>从死亡方式开始吧
<5-9,BECKETT>We start with manner of death.

153
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,910
<5-9,BECKETT>我们要查的是炸弹
<5-9,BECKETT>We know we're dealing with a bomb,

154
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,030
<5-9,BECKETT>这枚炸弹被安在坦纳的车里
<5-9,BECKETT>a bomb that was already in Tanner's car.

155
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,620
<5-10,RYAN>对  如果他在这辆车附近
<5-10,RYAN>Right, because he stayed near the vehicle,

156
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,490
<5-10,RYAN>就没人能去动手脚
<5-10,RYAN>no one could've tampered with it.

157
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,560
<5-11,CASTLE>安置炸弹的人肯定是在
<5-11,CASTLE>And whoever planted the bomb had to have

158
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,820
<5-11,CASTLE>早些时候接触到了车
<5-11,CASTLE>access to the car at an earlier point.

159
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,810
<5-12,ESPOSITO>比如在他的车库里
<5-12,ESPOSITO>Like in his garage.

160
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,040
<5-12,ESPOSITO>坦纳把车开到城里前  车就在车库
<5-12,ESPOSITO>That's where the car was before Tanner drove it downtown,

161
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,160
<5-12,ESPOSITO>我找邻居了解了一下情况
<5-12,ESPOSITO>and when I talked to the neighbors,

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,860
<5-12,ESPOSITO>有人看到今天凌晨一点
<5-12,ESPOSITO>one of them saw an unfamiliar motorcycle

163
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,300
<5-12,ESPOSITO>有辆陌生的摩托车开出了车库
<5-12,ESPOSITO>jet out of the garage last night at 1:00 a.m.

164
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,890
<5-13,CASTLE>他们看到车牌了没
<5-13,CASTLE>Did they happen to get a plate?

165
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,060
<5-13,CASTLE>没有
<5-13,CASTLE>No.

166
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,780
<5-14,ESPOSITO>但监控录像里有
<5-14,ESPOSITO>But this traffic cam did.

167
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,010
<5-14,ESPOSITO>摩托登记在一个位莫妮卡·莱恩名下
<5-14,ESPOSITO>Bike's registered to a Monica Lane.

168
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,450
<5-14,ESPOSITO>她是个安保承包商
<5-14,ESPOSITO>And get this--she works as a security contractor

169
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,720
<5-14,ESPOSITO>在奥顿公司工作
<5-14,ESPOSITO>at orton-geo.

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,830
<5-15,CASTLE>那就是那个差点被坦纳
<5-15,CASTLE>That's the fracking company

171
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,030
<5-15,CASTLE>搞垮的水力压裂公司
<5-15,CASTLE>Tanner almost put out of business.

172
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,900
<6-1,MONICA LANE>镜头还真是会把人拍胖了
<6-1,MONICA LANE>Man, the camera really does add 10 pounds.

173
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,450
<6-2,RYAN>你被拍到前  刚从一个公寓楼停车库出来
<6-2,RYAN>You were coming from an apartment building garage before that was taken.

174
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,340
<6-2,RYAN>你在那里做什么
<6-2,RYAN>What were you doing there?

175
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,820
<6-3,MONICA>不关你们的事
<6-3,MONICA>That's none of your business.

176
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,180
<6-4,ESPOSITO>戴尔·坦纳被炸得粉身碎骨  就与我们有关了
<6-4,ESPOSITO>It became our business when Dale Tanner got blown to bits.

177
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,990
<6-5,MONICA>什么  他死了
<6-5,MONICA>What? He's dead?

178
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,920
<6-6,RYAN>对  而且我猜贵公司听到这消息
<6-6,RYAN>Yeah, and I bet the company that you work for

179
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,410
<6-6,RYAN>一定欢欣雀跃
<6-6,RYAN>likes him a whole lot better that way.

180
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,520
<6-7,MONICA>我和他的死毫无干系
<6-7,MONICA>Look, I had nothing to do with his death.

181
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,300
<6-7,MONICA>事情不是你们想的那样
<6-7,MONICA>This is not what you think.

182
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,940
<6-8,ESPOSITO>那是怎么回事  莫妮卡
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Then what is it, Monica?

183
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,220
<6-9,MONICA>我和他在约会
<6-9,MONICA>He and I were seeing each other.

184
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,910
<6-9,MONICA>是吗
<6-9,MONICA>Really?

185
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,190
<6-10,ESPOSITO>你和戴尔·坦纳
<6-10,ESPOSITO>You and Dale Tanner?

186
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,660
<6-11,MONICA>我们几个月前在公园认识的
<6-11,MONICA>We met in the park a few months ago.

187
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,960
<6-11,MONICA>一拍即合
<6-11,MONICA>We just connected.

188
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,350
<6-12,ESPOSITO>可不是  看得出你很受伤
<6-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah. I can see you're real busted up.

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,130
<6-13,RYAN>你在刺探他
<6-13,RYAN>You were spying on him.

190
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,340
<6-13,RYAN>你接近他就是为了这个吧
<6-13,RYAN>Isn't that what this is really about?

191
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,770
<6-14,MONICA>奥顿公司因为戴尔·坦纳损失了
<6-14,MONICA>Okay, orton-geo lost half a billion dollars in contracts

192
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,130
<6-14,MONICA>五个亿的合约
<6-14,MONICA>because of Dale Tanner.

193
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,470
<6-14,MONICA>我的任务是接近他
<6-14,MONICA>My job was to get close to him

194
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,610
<6-14,MONICA>找出是谁在给他提供信息
<6-14,MONICA>and find out who was leaking him information.

195
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,690
<6-14,MONICA>但绝对没说要杀了他
<6-14,MONICA>But it did not involve killing him.

196
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,200
<6-15,RYAN>还有其他人盯着他吗  除了你
<6-15,RYAN>Was anyone else after him? Besides you, of course.

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,840
<6-15,RYAN>老天啊
<6-15,RYAN>Oh, God.

198
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,620
<6-16,MONICA>他的妻子
<6-16,MONICA>His wife.

199
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,600
<6-16,MONICA>他说她打过电话  说发现我俩的事了
<6-16,MONICA>He said she had called. She'd just found out about us.

200
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,950
<6-16,MONICA>她威胁要杀了他
<6-16,MONICA>She threatened to kill him.

201
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,260
<7-1,BETH>我觉得受到了背叛
<7-1,BETH>I felt betrayed.

202
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:48,850
<7-1,BETH>你明白吗
<7-1,BETH>Don't you see?

203
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,380
<7-1,BETH>我支持了他24年
<7-1,BETH>I-I stood by him for 24 years.

204
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,720
<7-2,BECKETT>你之前对他有外遇的事保密
<7-2,BECKETT>You withheld that he was having an affair,

205
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,780
<7-2,BECKETT>然后又费尽心思
<7-2,BECKETT>and then you went out of your way

206
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,830
<7-2,BECKETT>装出他因工作而丧命的样子
<7-2,BECKETT>to make it look like his work got him killed.

207
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,360
<7-3,BETH>他就是因为工作才死的
<7-3,BETH>Because it did.

208
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,740
<7-3,BETH>好  我承认
<7-3,BETH>All right, look, I admit it. Okay?

209
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,660
<7-3,BETH>我确实威胁过戴尔  但我当时很生气
<7-3,BETH>I said some things to Dale, but I was upset.

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,770
<7-3,BETH>另外  我根本没去过他的公寓附近
<7-3,BETH>Besides, I didn't go near that apartment. I didn't.

211
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,790
<7-4,BECKETT>你可以雇人动手
<7-4,BECKETT>You could've hired someone else to do it.

212
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,450
<7-5,BETH>钱从哪来
<7-5,BETH>With what money, huh?

213
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,230
<7-5,BETH>真是的
<7-5,BETH>Really?

214
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,470
<7-5,BETH>戴尔那个网站可不是摇钱树
<7-5,BETH>It's not like Dale and his web site ever made anybody rich.

215
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,850
<7-6,RYAN>贝克特  你得过来看看
<7-6,RYAN>Beckett, there's something you need to see.

216
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,440
<8-1,RYAN>这是鉴证组送过来的
<8-1,RYAN>So, um... C.S.U. sent this over.

217
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,530
<8-1,RYAN>他们掌握的线索不多
<8-1,RYAN>Based on what little they had,

218
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,930
<8-1,RYAN>但还是还原了起爆点
<8-1,RYAN>they were able to piece together where the explosion originated.

219
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,300
<8-2,CASTLE>我要大胆猜测一下
<8-2,CASTLE>I'm gonna go out on a limb here

220
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,820
<8-2,CASTLE>我认为炸弹是在他的车里引爆的
<8-2,CASTLE>and say the explosion originated in the car.

221
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,180
<8-3,RYAN>通常  在车上安装炸弹
<8-3,RYAN>Right. Well, normally, a car bomb is placed

222
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,030
<8-3,RYAN>会安在发动机舱里面或下面
<8-3,RYAN>inside the engine compartment or underneath.

223
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,800
<8-3,RYAN>但这个是在靠近前排座位的地方引爆的
<8-3,RYAN>But this one went off near the front seat.

224
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,850
<8-4,BECKETT>确实是安装在车里的
<8-4,BECKETT>So it was planted inside the car.

225
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,240
<8-5,RYAN>事实上根本不是安在那儿的
<8-5,RYAN>Actually, it wasn't planted at all.

226
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,090
<8-5,RYAN>鉴证组找到了这些金属碎片
<8-5,RYAN>C.S.U. found these metal fragments,

227
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,790
<8-5,RYAN>并且查明这是一种很特别的装置
<8-5,RYAN>and they were able to trace it to a very specific device.

228
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,430
<8-5,RYAN>他们将其拼凑起来
<8-5,RYAN>They put together this...

229
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,020
<8-5,RYAN>重现了爆炸过程
<8-5,RYAN>reconstruction of the explosion.

230
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,160
<8-6,BECKETT>那是导弹吗
<8-6,BECKETT>Is that a missile?

231
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,270
<8-7,RYAN>具体来说  这种导弹
<8-7,RYAN>Specifically, the kind of missile

232
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,730
<8-7,RYAN>是从无人机发射的
<8-7,RYAN>deployed from an unmanned aerial vehicle.

233
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,540
<8-8,CASTLE>戴尔·坦纳是被无人机杀死的
<8-8,CASTLE>Dale Tanner was taken out by a drone?

243
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,910
<9-1,RYAN>戴尔·坦纳前一秒还坐在车里
<9-1,RYAN>One second Dale Tanner's sitting in his car.

244
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,060
<9-1,RYAN>后一秒  嘭
<9-1,RYAN>The next... boom.

245
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,530
<9-2,RYAN>可怜的家伙  都不知道自己被什么击中了
<9-2,RYAN>Poor guy didn't even know what hit him.

246
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,690
<9-3,ESPOSITO>无人机怎么会攻击他
<9-3,ESPOSITO>This couldn't have been a drone strike.

247
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,950
<9-3,ESPOSITO>肯定是哪里弄错了
<9-3,ESPOSITO>There's gotta be a mistake here.

248
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,650
<9-3,ESPOSITO>没弄错
<9-3,ESPOSITO>There isn't.

249
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,660
<9-4,RYAN>鉴证组发现了PBXN-112爆炸残留物
<9-4,RYAN>C.S.U. found PBXN-112 explosive residue

250
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,410
<9-4,RYAN>以及导弹外壳的氟化铝成分
<9-4,RYAN>and fluoridated aluminum from a missile casing.

251
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,380
<9-5,ESPOSITO>军用无人机不可能
<9-5,ESPOSITO>There's no way that a military drone

252
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,500
<9-5,ESPOSITO>这么明目张胆地飞过纽约上空  丢下导弹
<9-5,ESPOSITO>could fly over New York city and smoke a guy.

253
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,680
<9-6,BECKETT>其实是可以的
<9-6,BECKETT>Actually, it could.

254
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,970
<9-6,BECKETT>在蒙德堡有个无人机训练基地
<9-6,BECKETT>There's a drone training facility at Fort Drummond.

255
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,470
<9-6,BECKETT>莱恩  我和卡塞尔去查这个线索
<9-6,BECKETT>Ryan, while Castle and I look into that,

256
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,810
<9-6,BECKETT>你去找认识坦纳的人聊聊
<9-6,BECKETT>can you talk to anyone that knew Tanner?

257
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,690
<9-6,BECKETT>看看能否查出他的搭档是谁
<9-6,BECKETT>Let's see if we can find out who his partner was.

258
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,460
<9-7,ESPOSITO>你和卡塞尔去蒙德堡
<9-7,ESPOSITO>What, you and Castle are going to Fort Drummond?

259
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,940
<9-8,BECKETT>无人机项目的负责人同意见我们了
<9-8,BECKETT>Yeah, the head of the drone program agreed to a meeting.

260
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,400
<9-8,BECKETT>到底怎么回事
<9-8,BECKETT>What is going on here?

261
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,390
<10-1,CASTLE>你认为是军队把他干掉的吗
<10-1,CASTLE>Do you really think the military took him out?

262
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,860
<10-2,BECKETT>我觉得他们不能这么做
<10-2,BECKETT>I don't see how they could.

263
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,150
<10-3,CASTLE>因为不能越界吗
<10-3,CASTLE>Because they wouldn't cross that line?

264
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,290
<10-4,BECKETT>据我的经验来看
<10-4,BECKETT>Because in my experience,

265
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,150
<10-4,BECKETT>庞大的官僚系统没那么效率
<10-4,BECKETT>huge bureaucracies don't act with that kind of efficiency.

266
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,770
<10-5,CASTLE>这话倒是令人安心
<10-5,CASTLE>Well, that's comforting.

267
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,170
<10-6,BECKET>你没什么军工企业的疯狂阴谋论吗
<10-6,BECKET>No wild theories about the military industrial complex?

268
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,750
<10-7,CASTLE>我不愿相信我们的国家会做这种事
<10-7,CASTLE>I just don't want to believe my country could do something like this.

269
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,410
<10-8,BECKETT>我也是
<10-8,BECKETT>Me neither.

270
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,370
<11-1,HOOPER>贝克特探长  卡塞尔先生
<11-1,HOOPER>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

271
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,230
<11-1,HOOPER>欢迎来到蒙德堡
<11-1,HOOPER>Thank you for visiting Fort Drummond.

272
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,680
<11-1,HOOPER>我们了解到你们认为
<11-1,HOOPER>So we gather that you believe

273
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,670
<11-1,HOOPER>发生在市内的这个事件
<11-1,HOOPER>that there was an incident that occurred in the city--

274
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,400
<11-2,BECKETT>不是事件  是谋杀案  无人机袭击
<11-2,BECKETT>No, not an incident. A murder, from a drone strike.

275
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,130
<11-3,COLONEL FORTIS>这种论断太过分了  探长
<11-3,COLONEL FORTIS>That's an outrageous accusation, detective.

276
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,120
<11-3,COLONEL FORTIS>你有什么证据
<11-3,COLONEL FORTIS>What do you base it on?

277
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,750
<11-4,BECKETT>在犯罪现场搜集到的物证
<11-4,BECKETT>Forensic evidence at the crime scene.

278
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,510
<11-4,BECKETT>说明爆炸物是由无人机发射的导弹
<11-4,BECKETT>It's consistent with a drone-fired missile.

279
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,000
<11-4,BECKETT>今天上午共有多少无人机出行
<11-4,BECKETT>How many drones were in the air this morning?

280
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,050
<11-5,FORTIS>那是机密信息
<11-5,FORTIS>That information is classified.

281
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,270
<11-6,BECKETT>福蒂斯上校  上午8点15分
<11-6,BECKETT>Colonel Fortis, was there a drone

282
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,600
<11-6,BECKETT>是否有无人机飞过纽约上空
<11-6,BECKETT>flying over New York City at 8:15 a.m.?

283
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,780
<11-7,FORTIS>那也是机密信息
<11-7,FORTIS>That's classified.

284
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,530
<11-8,CASTLE>这样问吧
<11-8,CASTLE>Okay, how about this?

285
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,740
<11-8,CASTLE>还有谁有权操纵无人机吗
<11-8,CASTLE>Did anyone else have access to the drones,

286
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,100
<11-8,CASTLE>比如说联邦机构或者公司
<11-8,CASTLE>any federal agencies, corporations?

287
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,450
<11-10,CASTLE>-那是  -机密信息
<11-10,CASTLE>- That's- - classified.

288
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,220
<11-11,BECKETT>既然如此  那我想看看你们的飞行日志
<11-11,BECKETT>Okay, well, then I'd like to take a look at your flight log.

289
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,280
<11-12,FORTIS>这次会面结束了
<11-12,FORTIS>This meeting is over.

290
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,420
<11-13,HOOPER>记住
<11-13,HOOPER>Keep in mind,

291
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,970
<11-13,HOOPER>你们签的弃权声明书禁止你们
<11-13,HOOPER>the waivers you signed prohibit you

292
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,780
<11-13,HOOPER>讨论我们这次的谈话
<11-13,HOOPER>from discussing what was said here.

293
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,050
<11-14,CASTLE>你们什么都没说
<11-14,CASTLE>Nothing was said here.

294
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,090
<11-15,HOOPER>那我们就相安无事了
<11-15,HOOPER>Well, then we shouldn't have a problem.

295
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,290
<11-15,HOOPER>说得好
<11-15,HOOPER>Touche.

296
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,290
<11-17,BECKETT>那个男人在犯罪现场出现过
<11-17,BECKETT>That man over there. He was at the crime scene.

297
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,430
<11-17,BECKETT>他是谁
<11-17,BECKETT>Who is he?

298
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,950
<11-17,BECKETT>是你的手下吗
<11-17,BECKETT>Does he work for you?

299
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,350
<11-18,CASTLE>别多此一问了
<11-18,CASTLE>Don't bother.

300
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,760
<11-18,CASTLE>那是机密信息
<11-18,CASTLE>It's classified.

301
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,570
<11-19,BECKETT>我不知道你们在搞什么鬼
<11-19,BECKETT>You know, I don't know what the hell you guys are up to,

302
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,220
<11-19,BECKETT>但我保证  我一定会查清楚的
<11-19,BECKETT>but I promise you, I will find out.

303
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,820
<12-1,CASTLE>也许现在该说说
<12-1,CASTLE>Now might be the time

304
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,910
<12-1,CASTLE>疯狂的军工企业阴谋论了
<12-1,CASTLE>for wild military industrial complex theories.

305
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,290
<12-1,CASTLE>听听这个
<12-1,CASTLE>And here's one--

306
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,810
<12-1,CASTLE>坦纳打算发布绝密的军事文件
<12-1,CASTLE>Tanner was about to post super-secret military documents.

307
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,490
<12-1,CASTLE>他们派一架无人机将其灭口  现在在掩盖真相
<12-1,CASTLE>They took him out with a drone, and now they're covering it up,

308
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,120
<12-1,CASTLE>这也不算太疯狂啦
<12-1,CASTLE>which actually isn't so wild.

309
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,800
<13-1,SHAWN>我不知道
<13-1,SHAWN>I don't know.

310
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,890
<12-2,BECKETT>也许他们是不小心发射了导弹
<12-2,BECKETT>Maybe they just... fired the missile by mistake.

311
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,380
<12-3,CASTLE>那枚导弹碰巧击中了
<12-3,CASTLE>And just so happened to hit

312
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,650
<12-3,CASTLE>对美国政府直言不讳的批评家吗
<12-3,CASTLE>a-a vocal critic of the U.S. government?

313
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,770
<12-3,CASTLE>出现在犯罪现场的男人
<12-3,CASTLE>And the guy from the crime scene

314
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,530
<12-3,CASTLE>又正好出现在那场卡夫卡式的会面上吗
<12-3,CASTLE>shows up at our kafkaesque meeting?

315
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,380
<12-3,CASTLE>我觉得没这么巧
<12-3,CASTLE>I don't think so.

316
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,310
<12-4,BECKETT>我都不知道他们为什么要和我们面谈
<12-4,BECKETT>I don't even know why they took that meeting.

317
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,600
<12-4,BECKETT>他们什么信息都不给我们
<12-4,BECKETT>All they did was stonewall.

319
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,470
<12-5,ESPOSITO>接到了鉴证组来电
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Yo. Got a call from C.S.U.

320
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
<12-5,ESPOSITO>联邦警察刚才来拿走了
<12-5,ESPOSITO>The feds just came in and seized all materials

321
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,120
<12-5,ESPOSITO>一切与坦纳案子有关的资料
<12-5,ESPOSITO>related to the Tanner case.

322
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,250
<12-6,CASTLE>什么  那爆炸残留物和碎片样本呢
<12-6,CASTLE>What, the explosive residue, the fragment samples?

323
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,530
<12-7,ESPOSITO>-都拿走了  -我们被耍了
<12-7,ESPOSITO>- All of it. - We've been played.

324
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,970
<12-8,BECKETT>他们和我们见面只是为了查明
<12-8,BECKETT>They just met with us to find out

325
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,200
<12-8,BECKETT>物证在哪里以及我们知道些什么
<12-8,BECKETT>where everything was and what we knew.

326
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,970
<12-8,BECKETT>然后他们取走了所有证据
<12-8,BECKETT>And then they grabbed all the evidence.

327
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,750
<12-9,ESPOSITO>现在我们无法证明有一场无人机袭击
<12-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and now we have no proof that a drone strike ever happened.

328
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,010
<12-10,CASTLE>我们依然不清楚谋杀的原因
<12-10,CASTLE>And we're no closer to figuring out why it happened

329
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,380
<12-10,CASTLE>以及凶手是谁
<12-10,CASTLE>or who did it.

330
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,400
<12-11,RYAN>也许坦纳的搭档能告诉我们
<12-11,RYAN>Well, maybe Tanner's partner could tell us.

331
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,020
<12-12,BECKETT>你知道那是谁吗
<12-12,BECKETT>Do you know who it is?

332
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,660
<12-13,RYAN>原来坦纳在东区大学
<12-13,RYAN>Turns out Tanner taught law classes

333
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,800
<12-13,RYAN>教授法律来维持生计
<12-13,RYAN>at East Borough College to make ends meet,

334
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,280
<12-13,RYAN>他的同事们说记得在大学附近
<12-13,RYAN>and his colleagues said they remember seeing

335
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,740
<12-13,RYAN>看到过他之前的学生奥马·迪克逊
<12-13,RYAN>a former student named Omar Dixon hanging around.

336
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,090
<12-13,RYAN>我询问了奥马的女友
<12-13,RYAN>I talked to Omar's girlfriend.

337
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,190
<12-13,RYAN>她说他的确为坦纳工作
<12-13,RYAN>She said that he did work for Tanner,

338
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,850
<12-13,RYAN>但他的工作都是秘密
<12-13,RYAN>but it was all hush-hush what he did.

339
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,390
<12-14,BECKETT>奥马现在在哪里
<12-14,BECKETT>And where's Omar now?

340
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,100
<12-15,RYAN>他女友说她不清楚
<12-15,RYAN>The girlfriend said she has no idea.

341
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,800
<12-15,RYAN>但是肖恩·坦纳可能知道
<12-15,RYAN>But Sean Tanner might.

342
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,230
<12-15,RYAN>他也在东区大学读书
<12-15,RYAN>He attends East Borough, too.

343
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,770
<12-15,RYAN>他曾经去学校和他爸见面
<12-15,RYAN>Used to drop by and see his dad.

344
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,890
<12-15,RYAN>也许他认识奥马
<12-15,RYAN>Maybe he knows Omar.

345
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,640
<12-16,CASTLE>我觉得他确实认识
<12-16,CASTLE>Oh, I think he does.

346
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,290
<12-16,CASTLE>你记得当我们询问
<12-16,CASTLE>You remember what he did

347
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,800
<12-16,CASTLE>他是否知道他爸爸的搭档时  他做了什么吗
<12-16,CASTLE>when you asked if he knew his dad's partner?

348
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,090
<12-17,BECKETT>-他转移了话题  -正解
<12-17,BECKETT>- He changed the subject. - Boom.

349
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,040
<13-1,SHAWN>我告诉你  我不认识他
<13-1,SHAWN>I'm telling you, I don't know him.

350
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,090
<13-1,SHAWN>我不认识什么奥马·迪克逊
<13-1,SHAWN>I don't know anyone named Omar Dixon.

351
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,180
<13-2,RYAN>肖恩  我知道执法部门
<13-2,RYAN>Look, Sean, I know that law enforcement

352
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,440
<13-2,RYAN>不总是站在你们一边
<13-2,RYAN>hasn't always been on your guys' side.

353
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,310
<13-3,SHAWN>是从来都没有过
<13-3,SHAWN>Try never.

354
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,030
<13-4,RYAN>但我们不是联调局  肖恩
<13-4,RYAN>But we're not the feds, Sean.

355
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,340
<13-4,RYAN>我们是想侦破你爸的谋杀案的警察
<13-4,RYAN>We're the guys trying to solve your dad's murder.

356
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,280
<13-4,RYAN>不管你怎么想
<13-4,RYAN>And no matter what you think,

357
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,620
<13-4,RYAN>我们没查出真凶就决不罢休
<13-4,RYAN>we're not gonna stop until that job is done.

358
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,790
<13-5,ESPSOTIO>告诉你  小弟
<13-5,ESPSOTIO>Here's the thing, bro--

359
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,120
<13-5,ESPSOTIO>如果你爸是因为他发布到网站上的资料而被谋杀

<14-3,BECKET>我得问你几个有关戴尔·坦纳的问题
<14-3,BECKET>Need to ask you a few questions about Dale Tanner.

373
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,110
<14-4,OMAR>我不要被牵扯进来
<14-4,OMAR>I'm not getting involved.

374
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,140
<14-5,BECKETT>奥马  你已经身陷其中了
<14-5,BECKETT>Omar, you're already involved.

375
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,180
<14-6,OMAR>那我不要越陷越深了
<14-6,OMAR>Well, then I'm not getting any more involved.

376
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,970
<14-6,OMAR>我在新闻中看到他的车被炸就已经够糟糕的了
<14-6,OMAR>It's bad enough I saw his blown-up car on the news.

377
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,340
<14-6,OMAR>现在也有人跟踪我
<14-6,OMAR>Now I've got people following me.

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,420
<14-6,OMAR>不止是你
<14-6,OMAR>And not just you.

379

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,820
<14-8,OMAR>女士  我不知道他们是谁
<14-8,OMAR>I have no idea, lady. No idea who they are.

381
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,520
<14-9,BECKETT>谁杀的坦纳
<14-9,BECKETT>Who killed Tanner?

382
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,360
<14-9,BECKETT>是因为他打算发布的文件吗
<14-9,BECKETT>Was it because of the documents that he was gonna post?

383
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,410
<14-10,OMAR>我他妈怎么知道
<14-10,OMAR>How the hell should I know?

<14-12,OMAR>他的搭档  人们是这么觉得的吗
<14-12,OMAR>His partner? Is that what people think?

386
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,760
<14-12,OMAR>所以他们才来跟踪我
<14-12,OMAR>Is that why they're after me?

387
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,780
<14-13,BECKETT>如果你不是他的搭档
<14-13,BECKETT>If you're not his partner,

388
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,680
<14-13,BECKETT>那你是谁
<14-13,BECKETT>then who are you?

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,990
<14-14,OMAR>他的助手  我是他的IT兼职工
<14-14,OMAR>His assistant. I'm his part-time I.T. Guy.

<14-14,OMAR>我建立他的网站  他给我文件
<14-14,OMAR>I set up his web site. He gave me files.

391
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,870
<14-14,OMAR>我将其上传  就这样
<14-14,OMAR>I'd upload them, and for that,

<14-14,OMAR>那个混蛋每小时付我15块
<14-14,OMAR>the cheap bastard paid me 15 bucks an hour.

<14-15,BECKETT>他告诉过你他在忙活什么吗
<14-15,BECKETT>Did he tell you what he was working on?

394
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,660
<14-16,OMAR>我不知道  也不关心
<14-16,OMAR>I didn't know and I didn't care.

395
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,740
<14-16,OMAR>对我来说只是一份兼职
<14-16,OMAR>It was just a gig for me,

396
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,540
<14-16,OMAR>现在  我都后悔我接下这份活儿了
<14-16,OMAR>and right now, I'm sorry I ever took it.

00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,530
<14-19,BECKETT>你被捕了
<14-19,BECKETT>You're under arrest.

403
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
<15-1,CASTLE>作为随身携带消声手枪的人  他够冷静的
<15-1,CASTLE>He's awfully calm for a guy walking around with a silenced pistol.

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
<15-2,BECKETT>他之前也进过这样的房间
<15-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he's been in rooms like this before.

405
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,140
<15-5,BECKETT>我们对罗伯特·威廉姆斯有什么了解
<15-5,BECKETT>So what do we know about Robert Williams?

408
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,690
<15-8,ESPOSITO>指纹系统里没有
<15-8,ESPOSITO>There's no record of them in the system.

409
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,240
<15-8,ESPOSITO>我不知道这家伙是谁
<15-8,ESPOSITO>I don't know who this guy is.

410
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,350
<15-9,CASTLE>我觉得
<15-9,CASTLE>As is my way,

411
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,030
<15-9,CASTLE>他是政府杀手

414
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,120
<16-2,STACK>这重要吗
<16-2,STACK>Does it matter?

415
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,670
<16-2,STACK>我们又不需要相互了解
<16-2,STACK>It's not like we're gonna get to know each other.

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,820
<16-3,BECKETT>谁杀了戴尔·坦纳

418
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,690
<16-3,BECKETT>还是你的工作就是给人收拾烂摊子
<16-3,BECKETT>or was your job just to clean up the mess?

419

448
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,760
<18-4,STACK>司法部长办公室特别调查员
<18-4,STACK>Special investigator for the attorney general's office.

449
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,890
<18-5,CASTLE>从没听过
<18-5,CASTLE>I've never heard of it.

450
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,020
<18-6,STACK>那是应该的
<18-6,STACK>You're not supposed to.

451
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,760
<18-7,BECKETT>你跟戴尔·坦纳有什么关系
<18-7,BECKETT>And what's you connection to Dale Tanner?

452
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,680
<18-8,STACK>坦纳本来正在被联调局
<18-8,STACK>Tanner was under scrutiny

453
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,890
<18-8,STACK>国土安全部  五角大楼的监视
<18-8,STACK>by the FBI, D.H.S., and the Pentagon,

454
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,470
<18-8,STACK>更别说纽约警局反恐部了
<18-8,STACK>not to mention the NYPD counterterrorism unit.

455
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,170
<18-8,STACK>需要有合适的人来调查他的死亡
<18-8,STACK>Somebody objective needed to look into his death,

456
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,260
<18-8,STACK>所以他们选了我
<18-8,STACK>so they picked me.

457
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,170
<18-9,BECKETT>你什么时候知道他不是死于汽车炸弹
<18-9,BECKETT>When did you realize that he was killed by a drone

458
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,840
<18-9,BECKETT>而是无人机袭击
<18-9,BECKETT>and not a car bomb?

459
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,540
<18-10,STACK>我们的人检查了车的残骸之后
<18-10,STACK>Once our people examined the wreckage.

460
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,890
<18-11,CASTLE>为什么要造假身份证
<18-11,CASTLE>Why the fake I.D.?

461
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,730
<18-12,STACK>我不懂问这些有什么用
<18-12,STACK>I didn't know where this was headed.

462
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,980
<18-12,STACK>司法部长需要明哲保身
<18-12,STACK>The A.G. needs deniability.

463
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,190
<18-13,CASTLE>"部长会宣称对你的行动一无所知"
<18-13,CASTLE>"The secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions."

464
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,320
<18-13,CASTLE>《碟中谍》台词
<18-13,CASTLE>It's "Mission: Impossible."

465
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,410
<18-14,STACK>差不多吧  我还戴着人皮面具呢
<18-14,STACK>Pretty much. I'm even wearing a mask.

466
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,860
<18-15,CASTLE>-真的吗  -假的
<18-15,CASTLE>- Really? - No.

467
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,760
<18-16,STACK>你说你不懂我们问这些有什么用
<18-16,STACK>You claim that you have no idea where this is headed,

468
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,370
<18-17,BECKETT>但我觉得情况很明了
<18-17,BECKETT>but it seems pretty clear to me.

469
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,660
<18-17,BECKETT>军方对坦纳发起了袭击
<18-17,BECKETT>The military launched an attack against Tanner.

470
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,980
<18-18,STACK>我看了蒙德堡的日志
<18-18,STACK>I went over the logs at Fort Drummond.

471
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,030
<18-18,STACK>无人机不是那里来的
<18-18,STACK>It didn't come from there.

472
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,160
<18-19,CASTLE>那是哪里的
<18-19,CASTLE>Where did it come from?

473
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,920
<18-19,CASTLE>我也在查这个
<18-19,CASTLE>That's what I'm trying to find out.

474
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,420
<18-20,STACK>事实上  我们失去了很多无人机
<18-20,STACK>The fact is, we've lost a number of drones.

475
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,270
<18-20,STACK>一些落入了敌人手里
<18-20,STACK>Some of 'em have fallen into enemy hands.

476
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,940
<18-21,BECKETT>那么是我们一个敌人用无人机杀了坦纳吗
<18-21,BECKETT>So one of our enemies killed Tanner with a drone?

477
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,320
<18-22,CASTLE>这理论极不可能
<18-22,CASTLE>That theory is highly improbable,

478
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,650
<18-22,CASTLE>我都不买账  这很能说明问题
<18-22,CASTLE>and coming from me, that's saying something.

479
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,810
<18-23,STACK>这么说吧
<18-23,STACK>Think of it this way--

480
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,830
<18-23,STACK>政府要是真想杀了坦纳
<18-23,STACK>Let's say our government wanted Tanner dead.

481
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,640
<18-23,STACK>为什么不直接把他击毙在街头
<18-23,STACK>Why not just gun him down in the streets?

482
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,230
<18-23,STACK>为什么还出动无人机
<18-23,STACK>Why use a drone?

483
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,540
<18-23,STACK>为什么要选一个后患无穷的方式杀了他
<18-23,STACK>Why get rid of him in a way that could bounce back on them?

484
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,670
<18-24,BECKETT>跟大多数凶手的理由相同
<18-24,BECKETT>The same reason most killers do--

485
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,030
<18-24,BECKETT>以为能逃脱罪责
<18-24,BECKETT>'cause they think they're gonna get away with it.

486
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,110
<18-24,BECKETT>斯塔克
<18-24,BECKETT>Stack.

487
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,460
<18-24,BECKETT>什么
<18-24,BECKETT>What?

488
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,160
<18-25,STACK>你确定吗
<18-25,STACK>You're sure?

489
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,620
<18-25,STACK>好吧  给我发个链接
<18-25,STACK>All right. Uh... send me a link to that feed.

490
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,670
<18-26,BECKETT>谢了
<18-26,BECKETT>Thanks.

491
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,830
<18-26,BECKETT>怎么了
<18-26,BECKETT>What is it?

492
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,640
<18-27,STACK>是我的一个同事
<18-27,STACK>That was one of my colleagues.

493
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,820
<18-27,STACK>无人机不是蒙德堡派出的
<18-27,STACK>The drone wasn't from Fort Drummond,

494
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,390
<18-27,STACK>但飞机确实是我们的
<18-27,STACK>but it was one of ours.

495
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,310
<19-1,STACK>这是今早8点16分
<19-1,STACK>This is the video feed

496
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,320
<19-1,STACK>锡拉丘兹附近的空中国民警卫队基地
<19-1,STACK>off a drone on a routine training run from an

497
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,010
<19-1,STACK>派出的一架无人机进行例行训练时拍到的监控录像
<19-1,STACK>Air National Guard Base near Syracuse at 8:16 this morning.

498
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,880
<19-1,STACK>能把百叶窗关上吗
<19-1,STACK>Would you mind shutting those blinds?

499
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,270
<19-2,BECKETT>谁在控制飞机
<19-2,BECKETT>Who's flying the drone?

500
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,730
<19-3,STACK>问得好
<19-3,STACK>Funny you should ask.

501
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,780
<19-3,STACK>九分钟前驾驶员在长岛上空失去了对飞机的控制
<19-3,STACK>The pilot lost control nine minutes earlier over Long Island.

502
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,320
<19-4,CASTLE>什么叫失去了控制
<19-4,CASTLE>Whoa. What do you mean, lost control?

503
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,540
<19-5,STACK>自己听吧
<19-5,STACK>Take a listen for yourself.

504
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,440
<19-5,STACK>我也不知道  长官
<19-5,STACK>I don't know, sir.

505
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,000
<19-6,COMMANDER>飞机对任何指令都没反应
<19-6,COMMANDER>It's not responding to any commands.

506
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,890
<19-6,COMMANDER>好吧  试试重启通讯软件
<19-6,COMMANDER>Okay, try rebooting the comm software.

507
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,570
<19-6,COMMANDER>已经重启了  也不管用
<19-6,COMMANDER>I already rebooted. That didn't fix it.

508
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,920
<19-7,COMMANDER>我们要不要通知交管局...
<19-7,COMMANDER>Do we need to notify T.S.A. that--

509
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,400
<19-7,COMMANDER>等等  那是什么情况
<19-7,COMMANDER>Wait. What the hell is that?

510
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,590
<19-7,COMMANDER>你对那辆车启用目标程序了吗
<19-7,COMMANDER>Are you running a targeting protocol on that vehicle?

511
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,820
<19-7,COMMANDER>没有  我什么都没做
<19-7,COMMANDER>No. I'm not doing anything.

512
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,330
<19-8,COMMANDER>我也不知道怎么回事
<19-8,COMMANDER>I don't know what's happening.

513
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,990
<19-8,COMMANDER>我的天啊
<19-8,COMMANDER>Oh, my God.

514
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,680
<19-9,STACK>有人黑进了无人机系统
<19-9,STACK>Somebody hacked into that drone

515
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,900
<19-9,STACK>干掉了戴尔·坦纳
<19-9,STACK>and took out Dale Tanner.

516
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,910
<20-1,RYAN>这事没这么难以置信吧
<20-1,RYAN>Why is it so hard to believe?

517
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,960
<20-1,RYAN>常有人黑进银行系统
<20-1,RYAN>People hack into banks all the time--

518
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,060
<20-1,RYAN>五角大楼  美国宇航局什么的
<20-1,RYAN>the Pentagon, NASA.

519
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,210
<20-2,ESPOSITO>是  但黑进无人机系统吗
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but a drone?

520
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,390
<20-2,ESPOSITO>可能驾驶员在假装他控制不了了
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Maybe the pilot was just pretending that he wasn't flying.

521
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,810
<20-3,BECKETT>不对  那种惊慌失措没法假装
<20-3,BECKETT>No, no. You can't fake that kind of panic.

522
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,150
<20-4,CASTLE>我同意  他当时都要吓尿了
<20-4,CASTLE>I agree. He was having a pants-soiling moment.

523
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,990
<20-4,CASTLE>但我们忽略了一个可能性
<20-4,CASTLE>But there is one possibility we are neglecting.

524
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,750
<20-4,CASTLE>无人机本身
<20-4,CASTLE>The drone itself.

525
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,000
<20-4,CASTLE>就像《终结者3  机器人起义》
<20-4,CASTLE>It's "Rise of the machines",

526
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,100
<20-4,CASTLE>一如《终结者1》里的天网系统
<20-4,CASTLE>not unlike skynet in "The terminator".

527
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,580
<20-5,CASTLE>机器本身产生了意识
<20-5,CASTLE>The machines have achieved consciousness,

528
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,420
<20-5,CASTLE>他们怒气冲天
<20-5,CASTLE>and they are pissed.

529
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,190
<20-6,STACK>卡塞尔先生  抱歉让你失望了
<20-6,STACK>Sorry to disappoint, Mr. Castle,

530
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,360
<20-6,STACK>但我们要追查的是人类杀手
<20-6,STACK>but it's a human perp we're after.

531
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,160
<20-6,STACK>国家安全局拦截了一串
<20-6,STACK>N.S.A. picked up an encrypted signal

532
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,920
<20-6,STACK>驾驶员失去控制那一刻发送出去的加密信号
<20-6,STACK>that was sent out the exact moment the pilot lost control.

533
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,930
<20-6,STACK>这个信号覆盖了主控
<20-6,STACK>That signal basically overrode the controls

534
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,810
<20-6,STACK>使得黑客能控制无人机
<20-6,STACK>and allowed the hacker to take over the drone.

535
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,310
<20-7,BECKETT>信号来自哪里
<20-7,BECKETT>And where did this signal come from?

536
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,980
<20-8,STACK>来自纽约州下半部分
<20-8,STACK>From the lower half of the state of New York.

537
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,430
<20-8,STACK>国家安全局正在缩小范围
<20-8,STACK>Uh, N.S.A. is trying to narrow that down as we speak.

538
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,680
<20-9,RYAN>这么说  我们可能正在找一个
<20-9,RYAN>So for all we know, we're looking for

539
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,500
<20-9,RYAN>14岁的电脑宅男吗
<20-9,RYAN>some 14-year-old nerd with a computer?

540
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,190
<20-10,STACK>不太可能  这个黑客需要
<20-10,STACK>No, it's not likely. Whoever did this

541
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,920
<20-10,STACK>知道如何破解信号加密
<20-10,STACK>had to know how to defeat the signal encryption

542
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,060
<20-10,STACK>并拥有驾驶无人机的软件
<20-10,STACK>and have the software to run the drone.

543
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,850
<20-11,ESPOSITO>沃伯格
<20-11,ESPOSITO>Warburg.

544
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,040
<20-11,ESPOSITO>沃伯格是什么
<20-11,ESPOSITO>What's a Warburg?

545
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,510
<20-12,STACK>不是什么  是一个人
<20-12,STACK>No, it's not a what. It's a who.

546
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,520
<20-12,STACK>他是唯一能做到这些的人
<20-12,STACK>He's the only guy that could've pulled this off.

547
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,620
<20-13,BECKETT>我们该怎么找到他
<20-13,BECKETT>Okay, how do we find him?

548
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,950
<20-14,STACK>他销声匿迹已经有一年之久
<20-14,STACK>He's been off-grid for about a year.

549
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,700
<20-14,STACK>这家伙是个鬼魂  你们找不到他
<20-14,STACK>The guy's a real ghost. You'll never find him.

550
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,640
<20-14,STACK>我也许能通过追查这个信号找到他
<20-14,STACK>But you know what? I might by tracing this signal.

551
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,110
<20-15,BECKETT>也许我们可以合作
<20-15,BECKETT>Maybe we can work on this together.

552
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,270
<20-16,STACK>我同意告诉你们一些事
<20-16,STACK>I agreed to tell you what I knew,

553
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,290
<20-16,STACK>我已经做到了
<20-16,STACK>which I've done.

554
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,010
<20-16,STACK>合作愉快  贝克特探长
<20-16,STACK>It's been real fun, Detective Beckett,

555
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,050
<20-16,STACK>但是  从现在起  有我接手
<20-16,STACK>but, uh, I'll take things from here, all right?

556
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,920
<20-17,CASTLE>我还以为我们相处得很融洽呢
<20-17,CASTLE>And here I thought we all had bonded.

557
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,420
<20-18,BECKETT>如果沃伯格侵入了无人机系统
<20-18,BECKETT>If Warburg hacked that drone,

558
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,740
<20-18,BECKETT>他就是我们的嫌疑人
<20-18,BECKETT>then he's our murder suspect,

559
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,530
<20-18,BECKETT>我不会相信斯塔克的鬼话  说我们找不到他
<20-18,BECKETT>and I am not buying Tack's word that we can't find him.

560
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,380
<20-18,BECKETT>把他找出来  看看是个什么样的人
<20-18,BECKETT>Let's dig into this guy and see who we're dealing with.

561
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,580
<21-1,ESPOSITO>西蒙·沃伯格  编程界的传奇
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Simon Warburg-- a programming legend.

562
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
<21-1,ESPOSITO>克服了严重的强迫症
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Overcame severe O.C.D. to become

563
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,420
<21-1,ESPOSITO>成为了军用无人机操作软件的
<21-1,ESPOSITO>chief designer for the operational software

564
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,620
<21-1,ESPOSITO>首席设计师
<21-1,ESPOSITO>used in military drones.

565
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,360
<21-2,BECKETT>然后呢
<21-2,BECKETT>And then what?

566
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
<21-3,RYAN>他被发现破坏那个软件
<21-3,RYAN>Well, he got busted for sabotaging that software.

567
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
<21-3,RYAN>在联调局抓他之前就跑了
<21-3,RYAN>But he fled before the FBI could arrest him.

568
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,860
<21-3,RYAN>沃伯格
<21-3,RYAN>Warburg.

569
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,830
<21-4,CASTLE>听起来很像007里的大反派  对不
<21-4,CASTLE>Sounds like a Bond villain, right?

570
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,700
<21-4,CASTLE>制定统治世界的计划时
<21-4,CASTLE>Petting his cat while formulating a plan

571
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,010
<21-4,CASTLE>轻轻地爱抚小猫
<21-4,CASTLE>for world domination.

572
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,840
<21-4,CASTLE>你会问是什么计划
<21-4,CASTLE>And what is that plan, you ask?

573
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,660
<21-5,BECKETT>-我没问  -我问他们俩
<21-5,BECKETT>- Actually, I didn't ask. - Talkin' to the boys.

574
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,070
<21-6,CASTLE>建设一个无人机军队
<21-6,CASTLE>To create a drone army--

575
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,570
<21-6,CASTLE>一个可以思考  有意识的无人机军队
<21-6,CASTLE>a drone army... that can think, that possess awareness.

576
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,890
<21-6,CASTLE>哪有比设计系统给予它们生命的天才
<21-6,CASTLE>And who better than the programming genius

577
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,940
<21-6,CASTLE>更适合组建这支军队呢
<21-6,CASTLE>who designed their software to give them that spark of life?

578
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,180
<21-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不会以为那是真的吧
<21-7,BECKETT>Castle, you don't actually believe that.

579
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,180
<21-7,BECKETT>记住  如果你说了是
<21-7,BECKETT>And keep in mind, if you say yes,

580
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,930
<21-7,BECKETT>我会觉得你没那么有魅力
<21-7,BECKETT>I will find you less attractive.

581
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,090
<21-8,CASTLE>很有可能啊
<21-8,CASTLE>Well, it is conceivable,

582
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,180
<21-8,CASTLE>我得说  这是非常合理的构思
<21-8,CASTLE>and I have to say, a far better story.

583
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,070
<21-9,ESPOSITO>看这个
<21-9,ESPOSITO>Yo, check it.

584
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,440
<21-9,ESPOSITO>沃伯格在躲起来之前发过一段视频
<21-9,ESPOSITO>Warburg posted a video just before he went into hiding.

585
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,790
<21-10,SIMON WARBURG>人们不理解我为什么要篡改
<21-10,SIMON WARBURG>People don't understand why I tampered with

586
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,190
<21-10,SIMON WARBURG>无人机软件
<21-10,SIMON WARBURG>the drone software.

587
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,820
<21-11,CASTLE>这就是沃伯格  我还以为会是...
<21-11,CASTLE>That's Warburg? I was expecting...

588
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,550
<21-12,RYAN>邪恶博士吗
<21-12,RYAN>Dr. Evil?

590
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,680
<21-13,CASTLE>不这么书呆子气的人
<21-13,CASTLE>Someone a little less nerdy.

591
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,510
<21-14,WARBURG>因为我预见到了未来的情况
<21-14,WARBURG>It's because I've seen the future.

592
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,860
<21-14,WARBURG>我知道他们的计划
<21-14,WARBURG>And I know their plan.

593
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,120
<21-15,CASTLE>要来了  肯定是组建无人机军队
<21-15,CASTLE>Here it is. Building a drone army.

594
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
<21-16,WARBURG>他们会引入侦察机
<21-16,WARBURG>They'll introduce surveillance drones

595
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,330
<21-16,WARBURG>监视交通状况
<21-16,WARBURG>to monitor traffic.

596
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,420
<21-16,WARBURG>看起来无害  对吗
<21-16,WARBURG>Seems harmless enough, right?

597
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,720
<21-16,WARBURG>所以我们不会有异议
<21-16,WARBURG>So we let it happen.

598
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,690
<21-16,WARBURG>紧接着  就会有安保无人机
<21-16,WARBURG>Next, there'll be security drones.

599
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,760
<21-16,WARBURG>因为谁不想更有安全感一点呢
<21-16,WARBURG>Because who doesn't like to feel safer?

600
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,670
<21-16,WARBURG>然后会有武装无人机保护我们的领空
<21-16,WARBURG>And then armed drones to protect our skies.

601
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,320
<21-16,WARBURG>那时候  就太晚了
<21-16,WARBURG>And by then, it's too late.

602
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,160
<21-16,WARBURG>因为可执行监视  控制
<21-16,WARBURG>Because the system to monitor,

603
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,610
<21-16,WARBURG>随时可杀人的系统
<21-16,WARBURG>to control, to kill any one of us

604
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,110
<21-16,WARBURG>已经建好了
<21-16,WARBURG>will already be in place.

605
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,860
<21-16,WARBURG>必须有人来阻止这一切
<21-16,WARBURG>Someone has to stop this.

606
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,340
<21-16,WARBURG>哪怕这个人就是我
<21-16,WARBURG>Even if that someone is me.

607
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,830
<21-16,WARBURG>他不是在建无人机军队
<21-16,WARBURG>He wasn't building a drone army.

608
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,150
<21-17,CASTLE>他在阻止建这军队
<21-17,CASTLE>He was preventing one from being built.

609
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,970
<21-17,CASTLE>我猜的挺准
<21-17,CASTLE>I was pretty close.

610
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,410
<21-18,BECKETT>如果你的"准"指的是"恰好相反"
<21-18,BECKETT>If by "close," you mean "opposite."

611
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,540
<21-18,BECKETT>沃伯格认为无人机
<21-18,BECKETT>Warburg believed that drones were gonna be used

612
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,970
<21-18,BECKETT>会用来攻击美国公民
<21-18,BECKETT>to target U.S. citizens.

613
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,430
<21-18,BECKETT>所以他杀了一个激进主义分子戴尔·坦纳
<21-18,BECKETT>That's why he killed an activist like Dale Tanner--

614
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,790
<21-18,BECKETT>告诉大家未来就在眼前
<21-18,BECKETT>to show us that the future was already here.

615
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,610
<21-19,ESPOSITO>这家伙为了阻止这一切
<21-19,ESPOSITO>This guy basically framed the government

616
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,100
<21-19,ESPOSITO>陷害了政府
<21-19,ESPOSITO>to try to stop drone use.

617
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,510
<21-20,BECKETT>找到沃伯格  就找到了凶手
<21-20,BECKETT>So we get Warburg, we're gonna get our killer.

618
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,100
<21-20,BECKETT>我觉得我知道该怎么找
<21-20,BECKETT>And I think I know how.

619
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,750
<21-20,BECKETT>看那些书
<21-20,BECKETT>Guys, look at those books.

620
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,800
<21-21,CASTLE>都是自然科学类
<21-21,CASTLE>All on science.

621
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,790
<21-21,CASTLE>都是初版
<21-21,CASTLE>All first editions.

622
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,170
<21-21,CASTLE>那是《物种起源》
<21-21,CASTLE>That's "The Origin of the Species."

623
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,320
<21-22,ESPOSITO>所以呢
<21-22,ESPOSITO>So?

624
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,460
<21-23,BECKETT>他是藏书家
<21-23,BECKETT>So he was a book collector.

625
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,280
<21-24,CASTLE>有强迫症的藏书家
<21-24,CASTLE>A book collector with O.C.D.

626
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,820
<21-24,CASTLE>旧习难改啊
<21-24,CASTLE>a habit like that would die hard.

627
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,430
<21-25,RYAN>我明早开始查古董书屋
<21-25,RYAN>I'll start checking antique bookstores in the morning

628
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,420
<21-25,RYAN>看看沃伯格有没有联系过他们
<21-25,RYAN>to see if Warburg contacted any of them.

630
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,360
<22-2,CASTLE>没有坦克能让...
<22-2,CASTLE>No tank is gonna get...

632
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,830
<22-3,CASTLE>贝克特  起来  快走
<22-3,CASTLE>Beckett, get up. We gotta go.

633
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,280
<22-4,BECKETT>你真的被唬住了
<22-4,BECKETT>You totally fell for it.

634
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,500
<22-4,BECKETT>你以为这是《终结者3》吗
<22-4,BECKETT>You acted like it was "Rise of the Machines."

635
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,400
<22-5,CASTLE>我没有
<22-5,CASTLE>No, I didn't.

636
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,910
<22-5,CASTLE>我没把它当成《终结
<22-5,CASTLE>That's--I didn't think it was "Rise of the--

637
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,890
<22-6,BECKETT>如果真是杀人坦克  你早跑了
<22-6,BECKETT>If that was actually a killer tank, you bailed.

638
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,780
<22-7,CASTLE>我是去拿球棒来保护你
<22-7,CASTLE>I went to get the bat to the protect you

639
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,560
<22-7,CASTLE>来消除威胁啊
<22-7,CASTLE>to eliminate the threat.

640
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,330
<22-7,CASTLE>是吗
<22-7,CASTLE>Really?

641
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,710
<22-8,BECKETT>这有摄像头  卡塞尔  我看到了你的表情
<22-8,BECKETT>There's a camera here, Castle. I saw the look on your face.

643
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,080
<22-9,RYAN>贝克特  抱歉这么晚打给你
<22-9,RYAN>Hey, Beckett. Sorry to call you so late.

644
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,350
<22-9,RYAN>我查到了点东西
<22-9,RYAN>But I think I got something.

645
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,410
<22-10,BECKETT>莱恩  你还在局里干什么
<22-10,BECKETT>Ryan, what are you doing at the precinct?

646
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,990
<22-11,RYAN>我在看各种古董书屋的网站
<22-11,RYAN>Well, I was looking at web sites of antique bookstores,

647
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,140
<22-11,RYAN>然后我查了一下伍德斯托克附近的
<22-11,RYAN>and I was checking out one near Woodstock,

648
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,580
<22-11,RYAN>我好像找到了一个规律
<22-11,RYAN>and I think I've noticed a pattern.

649
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,740
<22-12,BECKETT>什么样的规律
<22-12,BECKETT>What kind of a pattern?

650
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,110
<22-13,RYAN>根据这份库存清单
<22-13,RYAN>According to this inventory grid,

651
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,340
<22-13,RYAN>有家店在上个月同一天卖掉了七本书
<22-13,RYAN>The bookseller sold seven books on the same day last month.

652
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,890
<22-13,RYAN>而且这七本书
<22-13,RYAN>And I see all seven of those books

653
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,770
<22-13,RYAN>都在沃伯格的书架上
<22-13,RYAN>on one shelf of Warburg's bookcase.

654
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,190
<22-14,CASTLE>要么是发生了不可能事件
<22-14,CASTLE>Either that's a statistical impossibility or--

655
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,440
<22-15,BECKETT>要么就是沃伯格在重新收藏
<22-15,BECKETT>Or Warburg is rebuilding his book collection

656
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,480
<22-15,BECKETT>书架上的书
<22-15,BECKETT>one shelf at a time.

657
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,650
<22-16,RYAN>也就是说  他是在那家书店买的
<22-16,RYAN>Which would mean, he ordered books from this bookstore.

658
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,250
<23-1,CASTLE>这种旧皮革和纸张的味道啊
<23-1,CASTLE>Ah, that aroma-- old leather and moldering paper.

659
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,340
<23-1,CASTLE>我宣布
<23-1,CASTLE>It's official.

660
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,880
<23-1,CASTLE>我喜欢这个地方
<23-1,CASTLE>I love this place.

661
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,870
<23-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看  是《斯道姆季节》
<23-2,BECKETT>Castle, look. It's "Storm Season."

663
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,730
<23-4,BECKETT>在大甩卖区
<23-4,BECKETT>Oh. On the clearance table.

664
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,180
<23-5,CASTLE>好感全无
<23-5,CASTLE>And the love fades.

665
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,510
<23-6,MARTIN TILLAGE>有什么需要我帮忙的吗
<23-6,MARTIN TILLAGE>Uh, can I help you?

666
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,150
<23-7,BECKETT>事实上  还真有
<23-7,BECKETT>Yes, as a matter of fact, you can.

667
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,930
<23-7,BECKETT>你认识这个人吗
<23-7,BECKETT>Do you recognize this man?

668
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,570
<23-8,MARTIN>我还真认识
<23-8,MARTIN>Oh, yes, indeed.

669
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,220
<23-8,MARTIN>这是史密斯先生
<23-8,MARTIN>It's--it's Mr. Smith.

670
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,240
<23-8,MARTIN>他是个很有眼光的藏书人
<23-8,MARTIN>He's quite a discerning collector.

671
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,770
<23-8,MARTIN>他从我这买了很多书
<23-8,MARTIN>Uh, he's purchased quite a few books from us here.

672
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,790
<23-9,CASTLE>叫史密斯  真有创意
<23-9,CASTLE>Really, Smith? That's original.

673
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,880
<23-10,BECKETT>你有他的地址吗  你们会送货上门吗
<23-10,BECKETT>Do you have his address? Does he get his books delivered?

674
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,800
<23-11,MARTIN>不  他都是自己来拿的
<23-11,MARTIN>No, no. He comes in and he picks them up.

675
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,300
<23-12,BECKETT>看见他开什么车吗
<23-12,BECKETT>Do you know what kind of car he drives?

676
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,470
<23-13,MARTIN>他一般是骑车
<23-13,MARTIN>Well, he usually rides a bicycle.

677
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,550
<23-14,CASTLE>他住在附近
<23-14,CASTLE>So he's local.

678
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,910
<23-15,BECKETT>我让他们两个查一下
<23-15,BECKETT>All right. I'm gonna get the boys to look up

679
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,400
<23-15,BECKETT>自从去年沃伯格消失之后
<23-15,BECKETT>all the properties bought or sold in the area

680
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,580
<23-15,BECKETT>这附近交易过的房产
<23-15,BECKETT>over the past year, since Warburg went missing.

681
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,570
<23-16,CASTLE>有没有搞错
<23-16,CASTLE>Seriously?

682
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,660
<23-17,MARTIN>这本书  很不错
<23-17,MARTIN>Uh, it's--it's-- it's a nice book.

683
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,130
<23-18,CASTLE>谢谢
<23-18,CASTLE>Thank you.

684
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,880
<24-1,BECKETT>据莱恩所说
<24-1,BECKETT>So according to Ryan,

685
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,650
<24-1,BECKETT>房子在这条车道的尽头
<24-1,BECKETT>the house at the end of this driveway

686
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,320
<24-1,BECKETT>十个月前通过代理人购买
<24-1,BECKETT>was purchased ten months ago by attorney.

687
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,500
<24-2,CASTLE>沃伯格就在这里
<24-2,CASTLE>Warburg is here.

688
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,760
<24-2,CASTLE>我能感觉到
<24-2,CASTLE>I can feel it.

689
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,310
<24-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们每到一个地方
<24-3,BECKETT>Castle, you've said that

690
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,920
<24-3,BECKETT>你都会这么说
<24-3,BECKETT>about every place we've been to so far.

691
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,570
<24-4,CASTLE>但这次我是说真的
<24-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but this time I mean it.

692
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,460
<24-4,CASTLE>这次的感觉特别强烈
<24-4,CASTLE>The force is stronger with this one.

693
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,780
<24-5,BECKETT>问题是  这里是私人领地
<24-5,BECKETT>The problem is, it's private property,

694
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,090
<24-5,BECKETT>我没有搜查令
<24-5,BECKETT>and I don't have a warrant.

695
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,410
<24-6,CASTLE>假装没看到标志就行了
<24-6,CASTLE>Just pretend you don't see the sign.

696
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,700
<24-6,CASTLE>听着  我们马上就要找到沃伯格了
<24-6,CASTLE>Look, we're on the cusp of finding Warburg,

697
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,610
<24-6,CASTLE>他至少是个嫌犯吧
<24-6,CASTLE>who, at the very least, is a person of interest

698
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,340
<24-6,CASTLE>至多可能是个超能力大反派
<24-6,CASTLE>and at most, a maniacal super-villain

699
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,450
<24-6,CASTLE>能用意念操控无人机
<24-6,CASTLE>with the power to bend drones to his will.

700
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,340
<24-6,CASTLE>然后
<24-6,CASTLE>And...

701
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,670
<24-6,CASTLE>门没锁
<24-6,CASTLE>Gate's unlocked.

702
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,730
<24-7,CASTLE>日头真毒
<24-7,CASTLE>Burning daylight.

703
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,280
<24-8,BECKETT>沃伯格可能就在这儿
<24-8,BECKETT>Maybe Warburg is here.

704
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,550
<24-8,BECKETT>这里偏远而且隐蔽
<24-8,BECKETT>It is remote and secluded.

705
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,520
<24-9,CASTLE>我又有个很不安的想法
<24-9,CASTLE>You know, I just had a deeply disturbing thought.

706
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,840
<24-10,BECKETT>就像你平时的那些想法吗
<24-10,BECKETT>Much like most of your thoughts?

707
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,270
<24-11,CASTLE>如果沃伯格与这事无关呢
<24-11,CASTLE>What if Warburg isn't involved?

708
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,860
<24-11,CASTLE>我是说  我们之前已经被耍过一次了
<24-11,CASTLE>I mean... we have been played before.

709
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,820
<24-11,CASTLE>如果斯塔克只是提到他的名字
<24-11,CASTLE>What if Stack just mentioned his name

710
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,970
<24-11,CASTLE>好让我们去白费力气
<24-11,CASTLE>to send us on a wild-goose chase?

711
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,530
<24-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不这么认为
<24-12,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, I don't think so.

712
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,870
<24-13,CASTLE>反正沃伯格涉案的证据
<24-13,CASTLE>Ah, still, there's no more proof that Warburg is involved

713
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,390
<24-13,CASTLE>不比无人机智能自控多
<24-13,CASTLE>than there is that the drone acted on its own.

714
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,640
<24-14,BECKETT>没搞错吧  我难道还没把天网
<24-14,BECKETT>Seriously? I haven't gotten that skynet thing

715
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,000
<24-14,BECKETT>从你脑子里洗掉吗
<24-14,BECKETT>out of your system yet?

716
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,770
<24-15,CASTLE>你可以嘲笑我  但记住我的话
<24-15,CASTLE>You mock me, but mark my words.

717
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,820
<24-15,CASTLE>会有那么一天的
<24-15,CASTLE>The day will come.

718
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,680
<24-15,CASTLE>科学家们称之为奇点
<24-15,CASTLE>The experts call it the singularity...

719
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,370
<24-15,CASTLE>科技超级智能的出现
<24-15,CASTLE>the emergence of a technological super intelligence--

720
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,720
<24-16,BECKETT>慢着  卡塞尔  等等
<24-16,BECKETT>Wait, Castle. Wait. Wait.

721
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,020
<24-16,BECKETT>你听到了吗
<24-16,BECKETT>Wait. Do you hear that?

722
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,130
<24-17,CASTLE>像是嗡嗡声
<24-17,CASTLE>Like a buzzing.

723
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,820
<25-1,CASTLE>你还好吗
<25-1,CASTLE>You okay?

724
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,280
<25-2,BECKETT>还好
<25-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I think so.

726
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,790
<25-3,CASTLE>这就像是《西北偏北》里演的那样
<25-3,CASTLE>Hey, that was just like "North by Northwest."

727
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,910
<25-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别激动过头了  它又回来了
<25-4,BECKETT>Castle, don't get too excited. It's coming back.

728
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,410
<25-5,CASTLE>你在干什么  我们应该逃啊
<25-5,CASTLE>What are you doing? We gotta run.

729
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,830
<25-6,BECKETT>没时间找掩体了
<25-6,BECKETT>We're never gonna make it to cover.

730
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,630
<25-6,BECKETT>它一旦进入射程  我就开枪
<25-6,BECKETT>As soon as it gets in range, I'm gonna shoot it.

731
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,310
<25-7,CASTLE>好吧
<25-7,CASTLE>Okay.

732
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,580
<25-7,CASTLE>好吧好吧
<25-7,CASTLE>Okay. Okay. Okay.

733
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,390
<25-8,CASTLE>难以置信  你竟然没一发命中
<25-8,CASTLE>I can't believe you missed with every shot.

734
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,060
<25-8,CASTLE>搞笑呢吧
<25-8,CASTLE>Really?!

735
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,680
<25-9,BECKETT>你以为是你把这无人机射下来的吗
<25-9,BECKETT>Do you think that you shot down that drone

736
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,260
<25-9,BECKETT>就你这点枪法
<25-9,BECKETT>with your marksmanship?

737
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,880
<25-10,CASTLE>我刚才挺身而出
<25-10,CASTLE>I rose to the occasion.

738
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,590
<25-10,CASTLE>这回
<25-10,CASTLE>Wow, this time,

739
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,190
<25-10,CASTLE>我真的保护了你
<25-10,CASTLE>I really did protect you.

740
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,720
<25-11,BECKETT>是啊  还保护了你自己
<25-11,BECKETT>Yeah, along with yourself.

741
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,270
<25-12,CASTLE>这弥补了所谓的
<25-12,CASTLE>You know, this makes up for what may be considered

742
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,620
<25-12,CASTLE>男子气概的短暂缺失
<25-12,CASTLE>a momentary lack of manliness.

743
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,850
<25-12,CASTLE>不  我已经获得了救赎
<25-12,CASTLE>No, I have earned my redemption.

744
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,600
<25-12,CASTLE>谁都抢不走
<25-12,CASTLE>Nothing can take that away from me.

745
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,950
<25-13,BECKETT>这些不是真的子弹  是空弹
<25-13,BECKETT>These aren't real bullets. These are blanks.

746
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,320
<25-13,BECKETT>空弹
<25-13,BECKETT>Blanks?

747
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,680
<25-14,CASTLE>我事先不知道
<25-14,CASTLE>Well, I didn't know that,

748
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,690
<25-14,CASTLE>所以这不能
<25-14,CASTLE>so that doesn't--

749
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,490
<25-14,CASTLE>不能消减我的英雄行为
<25-14,CASTLE>that doesn't diminish the act of heroism.

750
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,930
<25-14,CASTLE>真的是空弹吗
<25-14,CASTLE>That-- are those really blanks?

751
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,750
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>当然是空弹  你们两个笨蛋
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>Of course they're blanks, you idiot.

752
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,170
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>这是为了阻止你们这些闯入者
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>Meant to deter trespassers like you.

753
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,740
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>你刚才消灭了我最出色的一架无人机
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>You just obliterated my finest drone.

754
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,060
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>我要找警察逮捕你们
<25-15,SIMON WARBURG>I'm having the cops arrest you.

755
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,480
<25-16,BECKETT>那我给你省电话费了
<25-16,BECKETT>Let me save you a phone call.

756
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,160
<25-16,BECKETT>我们是为了戴尔·坦纳来的
<25-16,BECKETT>We're here about Dale Tanner,

757
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,260
<25-16,BECKETT>沃伯格先生
<25-16,BECKETT>Mr. Warburg.

758
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,100
<25-17,WARBURG>就知道有人会找来
<25-17,WARBURG>Knew somebody would be eventually.

759
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,060
<26-1,WARBURG>看看四螺旋桨直升机  我的最爱
<26-1,WARBURG>Check out the quad. It's my favorite.

760
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,010
<26-2,CASTLE>酷毙了
<26-2,CASTLE>Oh, sweet.

761
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,050
<26-3,WARBURG>毁掉我无人机的报应
<26-3,WARBURG>Payback for wrecking my drone.

762
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,660
<26-4,BECKETT>沃伯格先生
<26-4,BECKETT>Mr. Warburg,

763
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,270
<26-4,BECKETT>说说戴尔·坦纳吧
<26-4,BECKETT>let's talk about Dale Tanner.

764
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,290
<26-5,WARBURG>你想知道是不是我杀了他
<26-5,WARBURG>You want to know if I killed him.

765
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,740
<26-5,WARBURG>答案是  是的  是我做的
<26-5,WARBURG>The answer is, yes, I did.

766
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,080
<26-6,BECKETT>能告诉我为什么吗
<26-6,BECKETT>Would you like to tell me why?

767
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,980
<26-7,WARBURG>这要从两年前说起
<26-7,WARBURG>It began two years ago...

768
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,040
<26-7,WARBURG>从这里说起
<26-7,WARBURG>With this.

769
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,970
<26-8,BECKETT>我不明白一辆车穿越沙漠的照片
<26-8,BECKETT>I don't understand what a car driving through the desert

770
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,830
<26-8,BECKETT>跟戴尔·坦纳有什么关系
<26-8,BECKETT>has to do with Dale Tanner.

771
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,520
<26-9,WARBURG>情报显示车里有三名
<26-9,WARBURG>Intelligence reports said there were three

772
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,830
<26-9,WARBURG>阿富汗高级武装分子
<26-9,WARBURG>high-ranking Afghan militants in this car.

773
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,930
<26-9,WARBURG>制造商和车型都匹配
<26-9,WARBURG>It was the right make and model,

774
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,420
<26-9,WARBURG>并在高速行驶
<26-9,WARBURG>traveling at a high rate of speed.

775
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,810
<26-9,WARBURG>所以无人机驾驶员得到了袭击信号
<26-9,WARBURG>So the drone pilot was given the green light to strike.

776
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,900
<26-9,WARBURG>但后来
<26-9,WARBURG>But then...

777
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,520
<26-9,WARBURG>他看到了车上的这些红点
<26-9,WARBURG>he saw those red dots on the trunk...

778
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,320
<26-9,WARBURG>就有一种预感
<26-9,WARBURG>and he had a feeling

779
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,260
<26-9,WARBURG>于是他终止了任务
<26-9,WARBURG>so he aborted the mission.

780
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,350
<26-9,WARBURG>车里并没有武装分子
<26-9,WARBURG>There were no militants in that car.

781
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,780
<26-9,WARBURG>红点其实是玫瑰花
<26-9,WARBURG>The red dots were roses,

782
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,390
<26-9,WARBURG>因为行驶在沙漠路上的
<26-9,WARBURG>because the young couple driving down that desert road

783
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,500
<26-9,WARBURG>是一对新婚夫妇
<26-9,WARBURG>had just gotten married.

784
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,870
<26-9,WARBURG>那时我才明白
<26-9,WARBURG>That's when I knew I could no longer

785
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,790
<26-9,WARBURG>我不能再搞无人机程序
<26-9,WARBURG>be a part of the drone program.

786
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,050
<26-10,CASTLE>我不明白  为什么
<26-10,CASTLE>Uh, I don't understand. Why?

787
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,300
<26-10,CASTLE>驾驶员没有射击
<26-10,CASTLE>The pilot didn't fire.

788
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,290
<26-11,WARBURG>因为新一代无人机不会配备驾驶员
<26-11,WARBURG>Because the next generation of drones won't have pilots.

789
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,010
<26-11,WARBURG>新的人工智能软件会赋予无人机
<26-11,WARBURG>The new A.I. Software will give drones

790
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,520
<26-11,WARBURG>决策能力
<26-11,WARBURG>decision-making capability.

791
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,190
<26-11,WARBURG>它们获取数据并执行致命行动
<26-11,WARBURG>They'll assess the data and take lethal action

792
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,370
<26-11,WARBURG>全靠它们自己
<26-11,WARBURG>all on their own.

793
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,150
<26-12,CASTLE>《终结者3》真正上演
<26-12,CASTLE>It really will be "Rise of the Machines."

794
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,730
<26-13,WARBURG>那些无人机会毫不犹豫地把那辆车
<26-13,WARBURG>Those new drones would turn that car to ash

795
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,920
<26-13,WARBURG>化为灰烬
<26-13,WARBURG>without hesitation.

796
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,350
<26-13,WARBURG>这就是为什么人命关天之际
<26-13,WARBURG>That's why, when lives are at stake,

797
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,830
<26-13,WARBURG>需要有人看到玫瑰花
<26-13,WARBURG>we need a man who sees roses.

798
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,800
<26-13,WARBURG>我们需要人为因素
<26-13,WARBURG>We need the human factor.

799
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,080
<26-14,BECKETT>你在杀害戴尔·坦纳的时候  人为因素去哪了
<26-14,BECKETT>And where was the human factor when you killed Dale Tanner?

800
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,870
<26-14,BECKETT>我给你们看个东西
<26-14,BECKETT>Let me show you something.

801
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,220
<26-15,WARBURG>这个程序是我写的
<26-15,WARBURG>I wrote this program myself.

802
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,230
<26-15,WARBURG>看看这个用户友好型界面
<26-15,WARBURG>Note the user-friendly interface.

803
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,250
<26-15,WARBURG>我的得意之作
<26-15,WARBURG>I'm rather proud of it.

804
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,950
<26-15,WARBURG>这些红点表示现在纽约上空的
<26-15,WARBURG>Now these red dots are individual drones

805
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,330
<26-15,WARBURG>几架无人机
<26-15,WARBURG>currently over New York state.

806
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,460
<26-15,WARBURG>如果我点击一架
<26-15,WARBURG>Now if I click on one...

807
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,830
<26-15,WARBURG>我就能实时监控无人机的运行
<26-15,WARBURG>I can monitor the drone's function in real time.

808
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,370
<26-15,WARBURG>按一下按钮
<26-15,WARBURG>And with the push of a button,

809
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,580
<26-15,WARBURG>我就能控制飞机
<26-15,WARBURG>I can take over control of the aircraft.

810
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,310
<26-16,CASTLE>就像你对坦纳做的那样
<26-16,CASTLE>Just like you did with Tanner.

811
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,870
<26-17,WARBURG>我那天正在骑车
<26-17,WARBURG>Oh, I was on a bike ride that day

812
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,960
<26-17,WARBURG>远离电脑
<26-17,WARBURG>and nowhere near a computer.

813
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,640
<26-18,BECKETT>你刚才还说是你杀了他
<26-18,BECKETT>You just said that you killed him.

814
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,350
<26-19,WARBURG>我是指我的软件导致了他的死亡
<26-19,WARBURG>Well, I meant my software led to his death,

815
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,790
<26-19,WARBURG>但我没有杀他
<26-19,WARBURG>but I didn't do it.

816
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,650
<26-19,WARBURG>其实我在跟戴尔·坦纳联系
<26-19,WARBURG>In fact, I was in touch with Dale Tanner.

817
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,040
<26-19,WARBURG>我想让他公布这个程序
<26-19,WARBURG>I wanted him to post the program.

818
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,310
<26-19,WARBURG>所以我把软件载在闪存盘里给了他
<26-19,WARBURG>So I loaded it onto a flash drive and got it to him.

819
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,710
<26-20,CASTLE>你想坦纳把你的黑客软件
<26-20,CASTLE>You wanted Tanner to post

820
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,140
<26-20,CASTLE>发布到他的网站上
<26-20,CASTLE>your drone-hacking software on his web site?

821
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,390
<26-20,CASTLE>如果军方发现了
<26-20,CASTLE>If the Pentagon found out,

822
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,620
<26-20,CASTLE>他们就会不得不禁飞所有无人机
<26-20,CASTLE>they'd have to ground their entire drone fleet.

823
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,610
<26-21,WARBURG>没错
<26-21,WARBURG>Precisely.

824
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,050
<26-21,WARBURG>这会逼停无人机的研发工作
<26-21,WARBURG>It'd bring drone development to a grinding halt.

825
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,900
<26-21,WARBURG>但坦纳拒绝把软件发布到网上
<26-21,WARBURG>But Tanner refused to post the program.

826
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,690
<26-21,WARBURG>他把它发了回来
<26-21,WARBURG>He sent it back,

827
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,210
<26-21,WARBURG>他说不想让任何有电脑傻子
<26-21,WARBURG>saying he didn't want any idiot with a computer

828
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,300
<26-21,WARBURG>都能随便操纵无人机
<26-21,WARBURG>being able to take over control of a drone.

829
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,240
<26-21,WARBURG>我觉得他说的在理
<26-21,WARBURG>I realized he might have a point,

830
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,700
<26-21,WARBURG>就决定自己留着
<26-21,WARBURG>so, um, I decided to keep the program to myself.

831
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,390
<26-22,BECKETT>那如果你没用  坦纳也没有发布到网上
<26-22,BECKETT>So if you didn't use this and Tanner didn't post it,

832
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,400
<26-22,BECKETT>那是谁杀了他呢
<26-22,BECKETT>then who killed him?

833
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,270
<26-23,WARBURG>我得知他的死之后
<26-23,WARBURG>After I heard about his death,

834
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,240
<26-23,WARBURG>我检查了我寄给他的闪存盘
<26-23,WARBURG>I checked out the flash drive I sent him.

835
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,800
<26-23,WARBURG>发现有人把我的软件
<26-23,WARBURG>Someone copied my program off of it

836
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,310
<26-23,WARBURG>拷进了U盘
<26-23,WARBURG>onto a usb drive.

837
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,670
<26-23,WARBURG>肯定不是坦纳拷的
<26-23,WARBURG>Now it wasn't Tanner.

838
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,270
<26-23,WARBURG>因为他不会去操纵无人机炸自己
<26-23,WARBURG>He wouldn't order a drone strike on himself.

839
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,720
<26-23,WARBURG>也不会是我这方面的人  因为
<26-23,WARBURG>And it wasn't anyone on my end, because, well...

840
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,170
<26-23,WARBURG>我就一个人
<26-23,WARBURG>who else is there?

841
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,880
<26-24,BECKETT>这么说  肯定是坦纳身边的人
<26-24,BECKETT>So then it had to be someone close to Tanner

842
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,840
<26-24,BECKETT>此人能够接触到他的工作
<26-24,BECKETT>with access to his work.

843
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,650
<26-25,CASTLE>只有一个人能办得到
<26-25,CASTLE>And we only know one person like that.

844
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,810
<26-25,CASTLE>他的助手奥马·迪克逊
<26-25,CASTLE>His assistant-- Omar Dixon.

845
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,200
<27-1,CASTLE>我猜是这么回事
<27-1,CASTLE>Okay, here's my theory--

846
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,210
<27-1,CASTLE>奥马·迪克逊在为坦纳工作
<27-1,CASTLE>Omar Dixon is working for Tanner,

847
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,540
<27-1,CASTLE>但他生活十分拮据
<27-1,CASTLE>but he's just scraping by.

848
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,220
<27-1,CASTLE>然后得知了沃伯格的黑客软件
<27-1,CASTLE>Along comes Warburg's drone hack.

849
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,500
<27-1,CASTLE>坦纳不想要
<27-1,CASTLE>Tanner doesn't want it.

850
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,820
<27-1,CASTLE>但迪克逊却看到了商机
<27-1,CASTLE>But Dixon sees an opportunity.

851
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,980
<27-2,BECKETT>他觉得一个能操控无人机的黑客软件
<27-2,BECKETT>He realizes how much a drone-hacking program

852
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,050
<27-2,BECKETT>肯定值不少钱
<27-2,BECKETT>would be worth on the open market.

853
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,230
<27-3,CASTLE>没错  他拷贝下来  学会了使用方法
<27-3,CASTLE>Exactly. He burns a copy, learns how to use it.

854
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,010
<27-3,CASTLE>下一步就是  实地操作
<27-3,CASTLE>The next step-- real-world test.

855
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,960
<27-3,CASTLE>既然坦纳是个王八蛋  那正好
<27-3,CASTLE>And Tanner's a cheap bastard anyway, so...

856
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,080
<27-3,CASTLE>我来接
<27-3,CASTLE>I'll get it.

857
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,410
<27-3,CASTLE>找理查德·卡塞尔  请按1
<27-3,CASTLE>For Richard Castle, press 1.

858
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,660
<27-3,CASTLE>找贝克特  请按2
<27-3,CASTLE>For Beckett, press 2.

859
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,820
<27-4,ESPOSITO>我就直接说了  你个蠢蛋
<27-4,ESPOSITO>Yo. How about I just talk, jackass?

860
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,360
<27-4,ESPOSITO>我们通缉了奥马·迪克逊
<27-4,ESPOSITO>So we put out an A.P.B. on Omar Dixon,

861
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,080
<27-4,ESPOSITO>但他似乎早就听到了风声
<27-4,ESPOSITO>but it looks like he's already in the wind.

862
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,730
<27-4,ESPOSITO>他女友说他打好包袱
<27-4,ESPOSITO>His girlfriend said that he packed a bag,

863
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:52,360
<27-4,ESPOSITO>走消防楼梯跑了
<27-4,ESPOSITO>snuck out down the fire escape.

864
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,030
<27-5,BECKETT>把他的照片贴到机场
<27-5,BECKETT>Okay, circulate his photo to airports

865
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,520
<27-5,BECKETT>公交站和火车站
<27-5,BECKETT>and bus and train stations.

866
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,670
<27-6,ESPOSITO>已经在办了
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Already on it.

867
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,020
<27-7,STACK>贝克特警探  我很感谢你
<27-7,STACK>Detective Beckett, I sure do appreciate you

868
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,110
<27-7,STACK>帮我找到西蒙·沃伯格
<27-7,STACK>finding Simon Warburg for me.

869
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,870
<27-8,BECKETT>你告诉我们他的名字时就是这么期望的吧
<27-8,BECKETT>Is that what you were hoping for when you gave us his name?

870
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,780
<27-8,BECKETT>我只是觉得
<27-8,BECKETT>Well, I just thought

871
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,600
<27-9,STACK>你们可能会想到我们没想到的地方
<27-9,STACK>you might think of something that we hadn't.

872
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,370
<27-9,STACK>在我定位你手机时
<27-9,STACK>When I pinged your cell phone,

873
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,470
<27-9,STACK>我发现我是对的
<27-9,STACK>I realized I was right.

874
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,950
<27-9,STACK>联邦调查局已经去缉拿他了
<27-9,STACK>FBI's picking him up right now.

875
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,090
<27-10,CASTLE>有件事你可能会感兴趣  坦纳不是他杀的
<27-10,CASTLE>Well, then it might interest you to know he didn't kill Tanner.

876
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,230
<27-11,STACK>你什么意思
<27-11,STACK>What are you talking about?

877
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,200
<27-12,BECKETT>我们觉得凶手是奥马·迪克逊
<27-12,BECKETT>We have reason to believe that it was Omar Dixon,

878
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,440
<27-12,BECKETT>他是坦纳的助手
<27-12,BECKETT>Tanner's assistant.

879
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,150
<27-12,BECKETT>问题是  他逃跑了
<27-12,BECKETT>The problem is, he's on the run.

880
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,770
<27-13,STACK>这事我能帮忙
<27-13,STACK>I can help with that.

881
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,130
<28-1,STACK>面部识别系统正在扫描
<28-1,STACK>The facial recognition system's scanning footage

882
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,610
<28-1,STACK>过去两小时各大交通枢纽的监控录像
<28-1,STACK>over the last two hours from all the main departure points.

883
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,980
<28-2,ESPOSITO>这东西有多精准
<28-2,ESPOSITO>How accurate is this thing, really?

884
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,300
<28-3,STACK>只要他在摄像头前经过
<28-3,STACK>Well, if he passed in front of one of those cameras,

885
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,410
<28-3,STACK>就能找到他
<28-3,STACK>it'll spot him.

886
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,490
<28-4,RYAN>堪比《1984》里的"老大哥"
<28-4,RYAN>Man, talk about Big Brother.

887
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,940
<28-4,RYAN>但还是有办法能躲过这系统  对吧
<28-4,RYAN>There's gotta be a way to beat the system, though, right?

888
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,140
<28-5,STACK>戴副大墨镜
<28-5,STACK>Wear big sunglasses,

889
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,040
<28-5,STACK>用刘海遮住脸
<28-5,STACK>let your bangs hang down over your forehead.

890
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,690
<28-5,STACK>这样就能蒙混过关
<28-5,STACK>It totally messes with the software.

891
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,130
<28-6,ESPOSITO>万一没刘海怎么办
<28-6,ESPOSITO>What if you don't have bangs?

892
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,510
<28-7,STACK>可以化浓妆
<28-7,STACK>You could wear heavy makeup.

893
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,800
<28-7,STACK>把脸搽得五颜六色的
<28-7,STACK>Paint random-colored shapes all over your face.

894
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,360
<28-8,ESPOSITO>我才不干这种事
<28-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'm not doing that.

895
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,450
<28-9,STACK>找到他了
<28-9,STACK>And there he is.

896
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,930
<28-9,STACK>92分钟前在肯尼迪机场的国际候机楼  找到了
<28-9,STACK>J.F.K., International Terminal, 92 minutes ago. We got him.

897
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,020
<28-9,STACK>现在它会根据脸部
<28-9,STACK>Now it'll track him off his face

898
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,420
<28-9,STACK>还有衣服颜色来追踪他
<28-9,STACK>and the color of his clothes.

899
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,240
<28-9,STACK>该死
<28-9,STACK>Damn it.

900
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,590
<28-9,STACK>奥马·迪克逊上了去贝鲁特的飞机
<28-9,STACK>Omar Dixon caught a flight to Beirut.

901
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,820
<28-9,STACK>一小时前起飞了
<28-9,STACK>Left an hour ago.

902
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,500
<28-9,STACK>他跑了
<28-9,STACK>He's gone.

903
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,330
<29-1,ESPOSITO>我们联系了航空公司
<29-1,ESPOSITO>We reached the airline.

904
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,770
<29-1,ESPOSITO>奥马·迪克逊确实上了去贝鲁特的航班
<29-1,ESPOSITO>Omar Dixon was definitely on that flight to Beirut,

905
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,780
<29-1,ESPOSITO>-经阿联酋中转  -去贝鲁特干嘛
<29-1,ESPOSITO>- By way of Abu Dhabi. - Why beirut?

906
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,790
<29-3,ESPOSITO>他母亲那边的亲戚在那儿
<29-3,ESPOSITO>He's got family there on his mom's side

907
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,930
<29-3,ESPOSITO>而且有双重国籍
<29-3,ESPOSITO>and dual citizenship.

908
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,790
<29-3,ESPOSITO>他出境用的黎巴嫩护照
<29-3,ESPOSITO>He flew out on a Iebanese passport.

909
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,400
<29-4,BECKETT>能在他降落后扣押他吗
<29-4,BECKETT>Can we have him detained when he lands?

910
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,770
<29-5,ESPOSITO>不行  我们和黎巴嫩没有引渡条约
<29-5,ESPOSITO>No. There's no extradition agreement.

911
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,700
<29-5,ESPOSITO>也许他就是去那的原因
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Probably why he went there.

912
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,750
<29-6,CASTLE>而且在那里卖这黑客软件
<29-6,CASTLE>And it's an excellent part of the world

913
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,650
<29-6,CASTLE>绝对会非常抢手
<29-6,CASTLE>if you want to sell some drone-hacking software.

914
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,500
<29-7,STACK>说到黑客软件
<29-7,STACK>Speaking of drone hacking...

915
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,270
<29-7,STACK>来认识一下奥马·迪克逊吧
<29-7,STACK>Say hello to our friend Omar Dixon.

916
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,430
<29-8,STACK>回头见了  奥马
<29-8,STACK>See you later, Omar.

917
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,910
<29-9,BECKETT>我还以为他正飞往贝鲁特
<29-9,BECKETT>I thought he was heading to Beirut.

918
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,130
<29-10,STACK>我找了司法部长
<29-10,STACK>He was until I asked the attorney general

919
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,460
<29-10,STACK>他联系了航空局
<29-10,STACK>to contact the F.A.A.

920
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,380
<29-10,STACK>把航班召回了肯尼迪机场
<29-10,STACK>And have them recall the flight back to J.F.K.

921
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,450
<29-10,STACK>哥上头有人  关系够硬
<29-10,STACK>You know, one of the perks of working

922
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,100
<29-10,STACK>办事就是方便
<29-10,STACK>for an 800-pound gorilla.

923
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,750
<29-11,BECKETT>你们审问他了吗
<29-11,BECKETT>Did you already interview him?

924
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,700
<29-11,BECKETT>这个嘛
<29-11,BECKETT>Well...

925
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,440
<29-12,STACK>全靠你  我们才逮住了他
<29-12,STACK>You're the reason we got him, Detective Beckett.

926
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,460
<29-12,STACK>他就听你发落吧
<29-12,STACK>Why don't you do the honors?

927
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,080
<30-1,STACK>瞧瞧她
<30-1,STACK>Look at that...

928
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,030
<30-1,STACK>看她审讯的手法多老道
<30-1,STACK>How she uses the silence.

929
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,170
<30-1,STACK>她是一股不可阻挡的动力
<30-1,STACK>She's a force to be reckoned with.

930
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,870
<30-2,CASTLE>你还不算真正见识到呢
<30-2,CASTLE>Oh, you don't know the half of it.

931
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,770
<31-1,BECKETT>奥马  我们正在你的行李里搜寻一个U盘
<31-1,BECKETT>Omar, right now, your bags are being searched for a usb drive.

932
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,350
<31-1,BECKETT>你最好的出路  就是趁早向我坦白
<31-1,BECKETT>Your best bet is to tell me the truth before it turns up.

933
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,670
<31-2,OMAR>我已经坦白了
<31-2,OMAR>I told you the truth.

934
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,630
<31-2,OMAR>我跟坦纳的死没有关系
<31-2,OMAR>I had nothing to do with what happened to Tanner.

935
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,760
<31-3,BECKETT>那你为什么要逃往国外
<31-3,BECKETT>Then why did you flee the country?

936
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,550
<31-4,OMAR>因为我想活命
<31-4,OMAR>Because I like being alive, that's why.

937
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,920
<31-4,OMAR>有人在他车上装了炸弹  他们在追杀我
<31-4,OMAR>Somebody put a bomb in his car. I had people chasing me.

938
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,530
<31-5,BECKETT>你我都知道根本没有炸弹
<31-5,BECKETT>You and I both know that there was no bomb.

939
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,000
<31-6,OMAR>你什么意思
<31-6,OMAR>What do you mean?

940
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,320
<31-7,BECKETT>你用软件操纵了无人机
<31-7,BECKETT>You used the software hack

941
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,330
<31-7,BECKETT>发射了一枚导弹
<31-7,BECKETT>to fire a missile from a drone.

942
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,260
<31-8,OMAR>你胡说什么
<31-8,OMAR>You're outta your mind.

943
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,610
<31-8,OMAR>我为什么要这么做
<31-8,OMAR>Wh-why is this happening to me?!

944
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,990
<31-9,BECKETT>你打算告诉我你对沃伯格
<31-9,BECKETT>Are you actually gonna sit there and tell me that you had no idea

945
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,970
<31-9,BECKETT>给坦纳的闪存盘一无所知吗
<31-9,BECKETT>about the flash drive Warburg gave Tanner?

946
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,360
<31-10,OMAR>我当然略知一二
<31-10,OMAR>I had an idea, sure.

947
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,260
<31-10,OMAR>坦纳派我去情报传递点取回U盘
<31-10,OMAR>Tanner sent me to pick it up from the dead drop.

948
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,640
<31-11,BECKETT>你什么时候拷的软件
<31-11,BECKETT>At which time, you copied it.

949
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,990
<31-12,OMAR>我什么都没拷
<31-12,OMAR>I never copied anything.

950
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,640
<31-12,OMAR>我连里面是什么都不知道
<31-12,OMAR>I didn't even know what was on it.

951
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,810
<31-12,OMAR>第二天  坦纳说他不要了
<31-12,OMAR>The next day, Tanner said he didn't want it,

952
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,200
<31-12,OMAR>于是他派我把闪存盘
<31-12,OMAR>and so he--he told me to return the flash drive

953
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,060
<31-12,OMAR>送回情报传递点
<31-12,OMAR>to the dead drop.

954
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,900
<31-12,OMAR>我就干了这些  没别的
<31-12,OMAR>So that's what I did. That's all I did.

955
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,920
<31-13,BECKETT>还有人知道优盘的事
<31-13,BECKETT>Did anyone else know about the flash drive

956
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,380
<31-13,BECKETT>或者能拿到优盘吗
<31-13,BECKETT>or have access to it?

957
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,130
<31-13,BECKETT>有
<31-13,BECKETT>Yeah.

958
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,450
<31-14,OMAR>只有一个人
<31-14,OMAR>Yeah, just one person.

959
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,740
<31-14,OMAR>你好  肖恩
<31-14,OMAR>Hey, Sean.

960
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,190
<32-1,BECKETT>我们能进去吗
<32-1,BECKETT>You mind if we come in?

961
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,310
<32-2,SHAWN>进来吧
<32-2,SHAWN>I guess.

962
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,470
<32-3,BECKETT>你妈妈呢  肖恩
<32-3,BECKETT>Where's your mom, Sean?

963
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,470
<32-4,SHAWN>她去买东西了  怎么了
<32-4,SHAWN>She went to get groceries. What's up?

964
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,500
<32-4,SHAWN>有关于我爸爸的消息吗
<32-4,SHAWN>Is there news about my dad?

965
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,750
<32-5,BECKETT>我们和奥马谈过了
<32-5,BECKETT>We talked to Omar.

966
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,240
<32-5,BECKETT>他说你两个月前开始到办公室去
<32-5,BECKETT>He said you started dropping by the office two months ago,

967
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,960
<32-5,BECKETT>通常都是你爸爸不在的时候
<32-5,BECKETT>Mostly when your dad wasn't around.

968
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,860
<32-6,SHAWN>我喜欢跟奥马待在一起  那又怎样
<32-6,SHAWN>I like hanging with Omar. So what?

969
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,340
<32-7,BECKETT>你其实是想跟你父亲联络感情吧
<32-7,BECKETT>Or was it to connect with your dad?

970
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,440
<32-7,BECKETT>两个月前正是他搬出去的时候  不是吗
<32-7,BECKETT>I mean, two months ago, that's when he moved out, isn't it?

971
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,620
<32-8,SHAWN>我不是很明白
<32-8,SHAWN>Okay, uh, I-- I'm not exactly sure

972
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,300
<32-8,SHAWN>我们为什么要谈这些
<32-8,SHAWN>why we're talking about this.

973
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,430
<32-9,CASTLE>你去他教科的大学
<32-9,CASTLE>Is that why you went to the college

974
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,790
<32-9,CASTLE>也是因为这个吗
<32-9,CASTLE>where he taught classes,

975
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,270
<32-9,CASTLE>跟他联络感情
<32-9,CASTLE>so you could connect?

976
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,520
<32-9,CASTLE>肖恩  你的生活一定不容易
<32-9,CASTLE>I mean, it had to be hard, Sean,

977
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,550
<32-9,CASTLE>有那样一位父亲
<32-9,CASTLE>having a father like that--

978
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,680
<32-9,CASTLE>总是不在家  对工作如此地投入
<32-9,CASTLE>so absent, so driven.

979
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,790
<32-9,CASTLE>这个革命者把自己的使命看得
<32-9,CASTLE>A crusader who put his mission above all else, even...

980
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,270
<32-9,CASTLE>比亲人还重要
<32-9,CASTLE>the people who loved him.

981
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,300
<32-10,BECKETT>沃伯格的无人机操纵程序被存在一个4G的U盘里
<32-10,BECKETT>Warburg's drone hack was copied on to a 4-gig usb drive.

982
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,940
<32-11,CASTLE>程序被拷贝那天你恰好拿着一个
<32-11,CASTLE>Just so happens you bought the same kind of drive

983
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,280
<32-11,CASTLE>同样的优盘
<32-11,CASTLE>the day that copy was made.

984
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,350
<32-12,BECKETT>你给你父亲打了个电话
<32-12,BECKETT>You called your dad.

985
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,430
<32-12,BECKETT>你让他跟你见面
<32-12,BECKETT>You asked him to meet with you

986
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,090
<32-12,BECKETT>因为你想知道他的具体位置
<32-12,BECKETT>because you wanted to know exactly where he would be.

987
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,720
<32-12,BECKETT>不是吗  肖恩
<32-12,BECKETT>Isn't that right, Sean?

988
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,180
<32-13,CASTLE>是什么导致你走上不归路  肖恩
<32-13,CASTLE>So what pushed you over the edge, Sean?

989
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,810
<32-13,CASTLE>是在你发现他出轨之后吗
<32-13,CASTLE>Was it when you found out about the affair?

990
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,600
<32-14,SHAWN>我和我妈妈相依为命
<32-14,SHAWN>My mom... held us together.

991
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,590
<32-14,SHAWN>爸爸总是不在
<32-14,SHAWN>Dad was always gone.

992
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,500
<32-14,SHAWN>我们一直没有钱
<32-14,SHAWN>We never had any money.

993
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,910
<32-14,SHAWN>而且总是被监视着
<32-14,SHAWN>We were being watched all the time.

994
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,980
<32-14,SHAWN>因为所有的流言蜚语我们也没有朋友
<32-14,SHAWN>No friends because of all the rumors and whispers.

995
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,860
<32-14,SHAWN>就是这样
<32-14,SHAWN>And that was it.

996
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,240
<32-14,SHAWN>这就是我们的生活
<32-14,SHAWN>That was our life.

997
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,170
<32-14,SHAWN>这样他可以揭露恶行
<32-14,SHAWN>All so he could expose wrongdoing

998
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,380
<32-14,SHAWN>逼迫当局对这些行为负责
<32-14,SHAWN>and hold the authorities accountable.

999
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,780
<32-14,SHAWN>但他的家庭怎么办
<32-14,SHAWN>What about his family?

1000
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,980
<32-14,SHAWN>为什么我们还没有那些愚蠢的丑闻重要
<32-14,SHAWN>Why didn't we matter as much as some stupid scandal?

1001
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,440
<32-14,SHAWN>在做了这些事之后
<32-14,SHAWN>And then, after all of it,

1002
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,110
<32-14,SHAWN>在他让我们经历了这么多痛苦之后
<32-14,SHAWN>after everything that he put us through,

1003
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,780
<32-14,SHAWN>他抛弃我妈妈找了另一个女人
<32-14,SHAWN>He leaves my mom for another woman?!

1004
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,110
<32-15,CASTLE>你想让他付出代价
<32-15,CASTLE>And you wanted to make him pay.

1005
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,550
<32-16,SHAWN>他伤了她的心
<32-16,SHAWN>He broke her heart!

1006
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,770
<32-16,SHAWN>还伤了我
<32-16,SHAWN>Me...

1007
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,520
<32-16,SHAWN>他也伤了我的心
<32-16,SHAWN>He broke mine, too.

1008
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,890
<32-16,SHAWN>这是怎么了  发生什么事了
<32-16,SHAWN>What is this? What's going on?

1009
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,620
<33-1,CASTLE>回我家之后来一杯
<33-1,CASTLE>How about a nice glass of zinfandel

1010
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,690
<33-1,CASTLE>馨芳葡萄酒怎么样
<33-1,CASTLE>when we get back to my place?

1011
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:05,560
<33-2,BECKETT>在经历了今天这些事之后  这是个好主意
<33-2,BECKETT>After the day we've had today, that sounds great.

1012
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,170
<33-3,STACK>贝克特探长  卡塞尔先生
<33-3,STACK>Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle,

1013
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,450

<33-3,STACK>for your work on this case.

1016
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,610
<33-4,CASTLE>我想总统的赞扬没法
<33-4,CASTLE>I don't suppose the president's appreciation

1017
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,500
<33-4,CASTLE>以推荐词的形式出现在我的书上吧
<33-4,CASTLE>could come in the form of a blurb for my book?

1018
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,500
<33-5,STACK>对  那不可能
<33-5,STACK>Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

1019
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,760
<33-5,STACK>但是

<34-1,STACK>Let me ask you something.

1023
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,280
<34-1,STACK>你觉得五年之后的你是什么样
<34-1,STACK>Where do you see yourself five years from now?

1024
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,320
<34-2,BECKETT>我还没有想过这个问题
<34-2,BECKETT>I haven't really given it much thought.

1025
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,360
<34-3,STACK>当警督  还是警监
<34-3,STACK>As a lieutenant, a captain?

1026
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,630
<34-3,STACK>在警察系统中一步步往上爬吗
<34-3,STACK>At one police plaza climbing the ladder?

1027
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,130
<34-4,BECKETT>那些不是我心之所向
<34-4,BECKETT>That's not really where my heart is.

1028
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,280
<34-5,STACK>你的心在哪儿  那个房间里吗
<34-5,STACK>Where is your heart... in that room?

1029
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,390
<34-5,STACK>五年后你还想继续待在那里
<34-5,STACK>You want to be in that room five years from now,

1030
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,080
<34-5,STACK>继续抓那些杀人犯吗
<34-5,STACK>busting some killer's balls?

1031
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,240
<34-6,BECKETT>我跟你不熟
<34-6,BECKETT>I don't know you.

1032
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,930
<34-6,BECKETT>绝对没熟到谈这个话题的程度
<34-6,BECKETT>Certainly not well enough to have this conversation.

1033
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,890
<34-7,STACK>我曾经也也在谋杀案组待过
<34-7,STACK>Yeah, I used to work Homicide, too.

1034
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,460
<34-10,BECKETT>-真的吗  -对
<34-10,BECKETT>- Really? - Yeah.

1035
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,110
<34-11,STACK>在芝加哥
<34-11,STACK>Chicago.

1036
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,570
<34-11,STACK>直到有个人给了我另一份工作
<34-11,STACK>Till some guy tapped me on the shoulder.

1037
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,790
<34-11,STACK>今天我就是那个人
<34-11,STACK>Today, I'm that guy.

1038
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,410
<34-11,STACK>我想说的是
<34-11,STACK>What I'm saying is this--

1039
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,640
<34-11,STACK>我觉得你非常出色
<34-11,STACK>I think you're exceptional.

1040
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,980
<34-11,STACK>你聪明  坚强
<34-11,STACK>You're smart, you're strong,

1041
