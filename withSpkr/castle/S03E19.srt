1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,430
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>陪审团的女士们  先生们
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,040
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>证据确凿  无可置疑
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>the evidence tells us well beyond a reasonable doubt

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,100
<31-9,ALEXIS>被告奥蒂斯·威廉斯是有罪的
<31-9,ALEXIS>that Otis Williams is guilty.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,870
<31-10,CASTLE>他射杀了莱拉·埃迪森
<31-10,CASTLE>Now he shot and killed Lyla Addison.

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,150
<31-11,ALEXIS>动机为何
<31-11,ALEXIS>And for what?

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,580
<32-20,CASTLE>就为了她的车  区区一辆车
<32-20,CASTLE>For her car. Her car.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,770
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>但威廉斯先生并未就此停止暴行
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>But that was not the end of Mr. Williams' savagery.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,380
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>他把死者尸首扔进车尾箱后  驾车兜风
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>He tossed her body into a trunk and went on a joyride.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,880
<29-2,BECKETT>辩方纵然可以砌词狡辩
<29-2,BECKETT>Now the defense can make up any stories they want,

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,370
<29-3,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>却无法否定事实真相
<29-3,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>but those stories do not negate the facts.

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,810
<29-4,CASTLE>那就是威廉斯先生
<29-4,CASTLE>And the facts are that Mr. Williams

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,310
<29-4,CASTLE>是在死者车中遇捕
<29-4,CASTLE>was caught in the victim's car,

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,140
<29-4,CASTLE>车子布满他的指纹
<29-4,CASTLE>his fingerprints were all over it,

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,390
<35-1,BECKETT>他的衣服上沾有死者的血迹
<35-1,BECKETT>and her blood was on his clothes.

<2-5,CASTLE>What is the sense of living longer if you have to drink that?

<2-20,MARTHA>No, no, not about that.

44
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,080
<2-21,CASTLE>她骗我们说今天要去村子
<2-21,CASTLE>About where she's going today.

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,730
<2-21,CASTLE>她皱了下鼻子  她一撒谎就会这样
<2-21,CASTLE>Her nose crinkled. That's her tell.

46
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,400
<2-22,MARTHA>亲爱的  别多疑了
<2-22,MARTHA>Oh, honey, come on.

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,350
<2-22,MARTHA>这又不是世界扑克锦标赛现场
<2-22,MARTHA>This is not the World Series of Poker.

48
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,520
<2-23,CASTLE>听我的没错  她肯定另有计划
<2-23,CASTLE>I'm telling you, she's up to something.

49
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,890
<2-23,CASTLE>那你呢  你想陪我去看电影吗
<2-23,CASTLE>What about you? You want to go to the movies?

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,420
<2-24,MARTHA>儿子  我也不行
<2-24,MARTHA>No can do, kiddo.

<2-24,MARTHA>我约了承包商在工作室见
<2-24,MARTHA>Gotta meet with my contractor at the studio.

52
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,270
<2-25,CASTLE>那看来我只能自己去了
<2-25,CASTLE>Well, then it looks like I'm going by myself.

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,610
<2-26,CASTLE>或许...
<2-26,CASTLE>Or maybe...

54
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,720
<2-26,CASTLE>不用去了
<2-26,CASTLE>not at all.

55

<2-26,CASTLE>For Richard Castle, press 1.

56
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,480
<3-2,BECKETT>-嗨  -嗨
<3-2,BECKETT>- Hey. - Hey.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,940
<3-3,CASTLE>为什么正门那么多新闻采访车
<3-3,CASTLE>Why were there news vans out front?

58
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,810
<3-4,BECKETT>因为本案的被害人是乔·麦丘茨克
<3-4,BECKETT>Because of who our victim is Joe McUsic.

59
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,040
<3-5,CASTLE>谁
<3-5,CASTLE>Who?

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,840
<3-6,BECKETT>莱拉·埃迪森一案的7号陪审员
<3-6,BECKETT>Juror number seven in the Lyla Addison case.

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,350
<3-7,CASTLE>埃迪森一案  说真的吗
<3-7,CASTLE>The Addison case, seriously?

62
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,210
<3-8,BECKETT>-出什么事了  -他在律师做结案陈词时猝死了
<3-8,BECKETT>- What happened? - He dropped dead during the closing argument.

63
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,750
<3-8,BECKETT>蕾妮认为他是被毒死的
<3-8,BECKETT>Lanie thinks that he was poisoned.

64
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,490
<3-9,CASTLE>埃迪森财团的继承人惨遭谋杀
<3-9,CASTLE>Heir to the Addison Fortune is murdered,

65
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,300
<3-9,CASTLE>然后此案的陪审员之一也在庭上被杀
<3-9,CASTLE>and during the trial a juror is murdered as well.

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,470
<3-9,CASTLE>这完全就是约翰·葛里逊小说里的情节
<3-9,CASTLE>This has all the makings of a John Grisham novel.

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,550
<3-10,BECKETT>你在干什么
<3-10,BECKETT>What are you doing?

69
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,520
<3-11,CASTLE>我在发短信给牌友  抢这则新闻的首发啊
<3-11,CASTLE>I'm, uh, texting my poker group, calling dibs on this story.

70
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,640
<3-11,CASTLE>他的确是被毒死的
<3-11,CASTLE>He was poisoned, all right.

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,740
<4-1,LANIE>尸斑呈粉红色  尸体散发苦杏仁味
<4-1,LANIE>Pink lividity, the smell of bitter almonds--

72
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,240
<4-1,LANIE>试纸呈氰化物阳性反应
<4-1,LANIE>test strip came back positive for cyanide.

73
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,920
<4-2,CASTLE>氰化物  太妙了
<4-2,CASTLE>Cyanide? That is fantastic.

74
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,790
<4-3,CASTLE>但对陪审员来说是晴天霹雳
<4-3,CASTLE>Unless you're the juror.

75
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,930
<4-4,LANIE>尸体上没有任何刺孔
<4-4,LANIE>There were no puncture marks on the body,

76
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,370
<4-4,LANIE>毒物是经口摄入的
<4-4,LANIE>so it was ingested.

77
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,710
<4-5,BECKETT>这样杀人太奇怪了
<4-5,BECKETT>That's an odd way to kill.

78
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,730
<4-6,CASTLE>对纳粹和邪恶的独裁者来说  不算怪
<4-6,CASTLE>Not for Nazis or evil dictators.

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,460
<4-7,BECKETT>他是怎么摄入的
<4-7,BECKETT>How did he ingest it?

80
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,300
<4-8,LANIE>口腔内有褐色小点  说明他之前喝过咖啡
<4-8,LANIE>Brownish stains in his mouth indicate he recently had coffee.

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,590
<4-8,LANIE>也许咖啡里有毒
<4-8,LANIE>Maybe it was in there.

82
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,370
<4-9,BECKETT>在他摄入毒物后  隔了多久才死亡
<4-9,BECKETT>After he consumed the poison, how long before he died?

83
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,730
<4-10,LANIE>不多于15分钟
<4-10,LANIE>No more than 15 minutes.

84
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,940
<4-10,LANIE>据法庭书记员称
<4-10,LANIE>According to the court clerk,

85
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,620
<4-10,LANIE>麦丘茨克先生于今早8:37到达法庭
<4-10,LANIE>Mr. McUsic arrived this morning at 8:37

86
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,910
<4-10,LANIE>而后于9:13左右死亡
<4-10,LANIE>and died at approximately 9:13.

87
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,710
<4-11,BECKETT>15分钟
<4-11,BECKETT>15 minutes.

88
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,130
<4-11,BECKETT>也就是说他是在法院内遭投毒的
<4-11,BECKETT>That means that he was poisoned at the courthouse.

89
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,310
<4-12,CASTLE>-陪审员死了  谁会得益  -被告
<4-12,CASTLE>- And who benefits from a dead juror? - The defendant.

90
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,200
<4-12,CASTLE>英雄所见略同
<4-12,CASTLE>Then we agree.

91
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,480
<5-1,RYAN>被告是奥蒂斯·威廉斯
<5-1,RYAN>The defendant, Otis Williams.

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,570
<5-1,RYAN>这家伙是个无恶不作的混蛋
<5-1,RYAN>This guy's a real dirtbag's dirtbag.

93
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,460
<5-2,BECKETT>特大汽车盗窃  恶性伤人  谋杀未遂
<5-2,BECKETT>Grand theft auto, aggravated assault, attempted murder.

94
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,960
<5-3,CASTLE>"三宗罪混蛋"  这就是说一旦罪名成立
<5-3,CASTLE>Dirtbag trifecta, which means, if convicted,

95
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,370
<5-3,CASTLE>-他得蹲很久牢房  -无期徒刑  不得假释
<5-3,CASTLE>- he'd go away for a long time. - Life without parole.

96
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,000
<5-4,ESPOSITO>如果纽约州还能执行死刑
<5-4,ESPOSITO>I bet the D.A. would ask for the needle

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,330
<5-4,ESPOSITO>地方检察官肯定会提出注射死刑
<5-4,ESPOSITO>if New York still had the death penalty.

98
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,470
<5-5,RYAN>他们在失车上捉到他
<5-5,RYAN>They caught him in the stolen car

99
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,260
<5-5,RYAN>莱拉·埃迪森的尸体就在车尾箱里
<5-5,RYAN>with Lyla Addison's body in the trunk.

100
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,200
<5-5,RYAN>他们找到了他的指纹  死者的血迹
<5-5,RYAN>They got his fingerprints, traces of the victim's blood.

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,860
<5-5,RYAN>这家伙罪有攸归
<5-5,RYAN>This guy's way past guilty.

102
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,360
<5-6,CASTLE>这才是恐吓陪审团的最佳手段
<5-6,CASTLE>So this is jury intimidation at its finest.

103
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,080
<5-6,CASTLE>你杀了陪审员  不仅能让审判无效
<5-6,CASTLE>You kill a juror, you not only guarantee a mistrial,

104
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
<5-6,CASTLE>还能杀鸡儆猴
<5-6,CASTLE>but it also serves as a warning

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,090
<5-6,CASTLE>借此恐吓今后重审的陪审员
<5-6,CASTLE>for any future jurors on a retrial.

106
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,170
<5-6,CASTLE>我意思是  如果当陪审员会招来
<5-6,CASTLE>I mean, who wants to serve on a jury

107
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,370
<5-6,CASTLE>杀身之祸  谁愿意当啊
<5-6,CASTLE>if there's a chance of being killed?

108
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,380
<5-7,RYAN>但我们知道奥蒂斯不是凶手
<5-7,RYAN>But we know Otis didn't do it.

109
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,320
<5-7,RYAN>自他被捕后就一直处于监禁中
<5-7,RYAN>He's been incarcerated since his arrest.

110
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,860
<5-8,BECKETT>他可能有同伙
<5-8,BECKETT>He might have had an accomplice.

111
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,270
<5-8,BECKETT>乔·麦丘茨克死前15分钟  就是在这栋楼里
<5-8,BECKETT>Whoever poisoned Joe McUsic somehow did it in this building

112
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,160
<5-8,BECKETT>遭凶手投毒的
<5-8,BECKETT>15 minutes before he died.

113
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,040
<5-9,RYAN>我去找保安调出楼内所有走廊和
<5-9,RYAN>I'll get with security, pull the surveillance footage

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,730
<5-9,RYAN>公共休息室的监控录像带
<5-9,RYAN>from all the corridors and common rooms.

115
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,110
<5-10,ESPOSITO>我去跟陪审员们谈谈  也许有人看到了什么
<5-10,ESPOSITO>I'll talk to the jurors. Someone might have seen something.

116
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,830
<5-11,BECKETT>好的
<5-11,BECKETT>All right.

117
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,840
<5-12,BECKETT>我们去问问奥蒂斯·威廉斯先生  看他怎么说吧
<5-12,BECKETT>Why don't we see what Mr. Otis Williams has to say for himself?

118
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,110
<5-12,BECKETT>辩方律师
<5-12,BECKETT>Counselor.

119
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,390
<5-12,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长
<5-12,BECKETT>Detective Beckett.

120
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,670
<5-12,BECKETT>我想和你的当事人谈谈
<5-12,BECKETT>I'd like to speak with your client.

121
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,250
<5-13,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>探长  关于莱拉·埃迪森一案
<5-13,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>Detective, anything we have to say about Lyla Addison,

122
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,330
<5-13,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>要说的我们都在庭上说了
<5-13,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>we've said during the trial.

123
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,660
<5-14,BECKETT>我不是为埃迪森一案而来的
<5-14,BECKETT>I'm not here about Ms. Addison.

124
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
<5-14,BECKETT>我是为7号陪审员一案来的
<5-14,BECKETT>I'm here about juror number seven.

125
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,870
<5-15,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>好吧  他怎么了
<5-15,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>Okay. What's about him?

126
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,140
<5-16,BECKETT>-他是被谋杀的  -谋杀
<5-16,BECKETT>- He was murdered. - Murdered?

127
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,590
<5-17,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>我以为他是死于癫痫或是别的自然因素
<5-17,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>I thought he died of a seizure or some other natural cause.

128
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,940
<5-18,CASTLE>氰化物中毒可不是什么自然因素
<5-18,CASTLE>There's nothing natural about cyanide poisoning.

129
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,180
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>听着  我的当事人对此一无所知
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>Okay, look, my client doesn't know anything about that,

130
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,770
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>我也绝不会允许你们问他话
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>and there's no way I'm letting him talk to you.

131
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,500
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>失陪  我们还要上庭
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>Now if you'll excuse us, we're due in court.

132
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,420
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>走吧
<5-19,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>Let's go.

133
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,950
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>考虑到7号陪审员猝死
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>In light of the shocking circumstances

134
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,640
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>这一震惊的突发情况
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>of juror number seven's death,

135
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,660
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>本席相信参与本案的陪审团
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>it is my belief that this particular jury

136
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,340
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>已无法再作出公平的判决
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>is no longer capable of reaching a fair verdict.

137
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,920
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>故本席只能无奈宣告  本次审判无效
<6-1,JUDGE FITZ>Therefore, I have no choice but to declare a mistrial.

138
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,660
<6-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>法官阁下  原告将会再度提出指控
<6-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>Uh, your honor, the people intend to refile charges.

139
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,510
<6-2,JUDGE FITZ>记录在案
<6-2,JUDGE FITZ>Noted.

140
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,770
<6-2,JUDGE FITZ>在此之前  威廉斯将还押候审
<6-2,JUDGE FITZ>Until then, Mr. Williams will be remanded.

141
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,670
<6-2,JUDGE FITZ>本次听证会延期举行
<6-2,JUDGE FITZ>This hearing is adjourned.

142
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,790
<6-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>法官阁下  这能叫正义吗
<6-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>You call this justice, your honor?

143
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,100
<6-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>他可是杀了我女儿啊
<6-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>After what he did to my daughter?

144
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,060
<6-4,RANDOLPH ADDISON>你...这个禽兽
<6-4,RANDOLPH ADDISON>You... Monster.

145
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,850
<6-5,STEPHEN ADDISON>爸  爸  冷静
<6-5,STEPHEN ADDISON>Dad! Dad, no.

146
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,570
<6-5,STEPHEN ADDISON>我们回家
<6-5,STEPHEN ADDISON>Let's go home.

147
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,780
<6-6,CASTLE>看上去奥蒂斯的计划得逞了
<6-6,CASTLE>Looks like Otis' plan is working.

148
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,920
<6-7,BECKETT>嗯  到目前为止
<6-7,BECKETT>Yeah, for now.

149
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,060
<7-1,BECKETT>莱恩  你查到什么了吗
<7-1,BECKETT>Ryan, you find anything yet?

150
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,550
<7-2,RYAN>暂时没有  那幢大楼里有很多个摄像头
<7-2,RYAN>Not yet. That building has a lot of cameras.

151
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,130
<7-2,RYAN>尽管我们要查的时间范围很小  也需要
<7-2,RYAN>Even though we have a very narrow time frame, it's gonna

152
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,340
<7-2,RYAN>花上几个小时才能全部看完
<7-2,RYAN>take a couple of hours to get through all of it.

153
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,790
<7-3,ESPOSITO>也许我们对被告的看法是错的
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Maybe we're wrong about the defendant.

154
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,490
<7-3,ESPOSITO>也许我们应该调查一下陪审员
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Maybe we should be looking at a juror.

155
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,230
<7-4,BECKETT>你是什么意思
<7-4,BECKETT>What do you mean?

156
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,410
<7-5,ESPOSITO>托尼·缪勒  4号陪审员
<7-5,ESPOSITO>Tony Muller. Juror number four.

157
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,710
<7-5,ESPOSITO>谋杀案发生后他就失踪了
<7-5,ESPOSITO>He's been missing since the murder.

158
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,490
<7-5,ESPOSITO>他没有来参加我们的问话
<7-5,ESPOSITO>He was a no-show for one of our interviews.

159
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,190
<7-5,ESPOSITO>他也不接电话  邻居们看到他
<7-5,ESPOSITO>He's not answering his cell. Neighbors saw him

160
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,660
<7-5,ESPOSITO>带着一个过夜行李离开了公寓
<7-5,ESPOSITO>leave his apartment with an overnight bag.

161
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,160
<7-6,BECKETT>好的  在监控录像上注意一下这个人
<7-6,BECKETT>All right, keep an eye out for him on the video.

162
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,070
<7-7,ESPOSITO>-我已经对他发了全面通缉  -是吗
<7-7,ESPOSITO>- I already got an A.P.B.out on him. - Oh, you do?

163
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,350
<7-7,ESPOSITO>-嗯  -干得不错
<7-7,ESPOSITO>- Mm-hmm. - Good.

165
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,390
<7-7,ESPOSITO>被害陪审员的弟弟来了
<7-7,ESPOSITO>The brother of your dead juror's here.

166
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,420
<8-1,EDDIE MCUSIC>我原以为法庭应该是很安全的
<8-1,EDDIE MCUSIC>I thought courtrooms were supposed to be safe.

167
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,220
<8-2,BECKETT>我很抱歉  麦丘茨克先生
<8-2,BECKETT>I'm so sorry, Mr. McUsic.

168
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,380
<8-2,BECKETT>我们正在尽全力查明真相
<8-2,BECKETT>We're doing everything we can to figure it out.

169
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,150
<8-3,EDDIE MCUSIC>但是谁会想要伤害乔呢
<8-3,EDDIE MCUSIC>But who would want to hurt Joe? Well,

170
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,000
<8-4,BECKETT>有可能和你哥哥本身没有关系
<8-4,BECKETT>you know, it might not have to do with your brother.

171
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,030
<8-4,BECKETT>或许和他所在的陪审团有关
<8-4,BECKETT>It might have to do with the jury that he served on.

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,760
<8-4,BECKETT>你知道他被分配到埃迪森的审判吗
<8-4,BECKETT>Did you know that he was assigned the Addison trial?

173
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,690
<8-4,BECKETT>不知道
<8-4,BECKETT>No.

174
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,470
<8-5,EDDIE MCUSIC>不知道  我只知道他要去做陪审员
<8-5,EDDIE MCUSIC>No. I just knew he had jury duty.

175
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,850
<8-6,BECKETT>你能不能想到任何你哥哥偏袒
<8-6,BECKETT>Can you think of any reasons why your brother might have been

176
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,700
<8-6,BECKETT>或者是反对被告的原因吗
<8-6,BECKETT>biased either toward or against the defendant?

177
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,340
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>当我哥还是个孩子的时候
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>when he was a kid,

178
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,770
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>他做过一些违法的事
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>my brother had a few scrapes with the law.

179
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,300
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>但他重新做人了
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>But he cleaned his life up.

180
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,010
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>他坚信人应该有第二次机会
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>He believed in second chances.

181
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,610
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>这就是为什么他要开办过渡教习所的原因
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>That's why he ran the halfway house.

183
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,440
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>但他不相信什么第三  四  五次机会
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>What he didn't believe in were third, fourth, fifth chances.

184
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,560
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>他在外面混了很长时间
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>He'd been out there long enough to know,

185
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,680
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>他知道有些人就是屡教不改
<8-7,EDDIE MCUSIC>some folks can't be rehabilitated.

186
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,340
<8-8,BECKETT>你知道你哥哥
<8-8,BECKETT>Do you know if your brother

187
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,320
<8-8,BECKETT>在工作上和谁有矛盾吗
<8-8,BECKETT>had any problems with anyone at work?

188
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,850
<8-8,BECKETT>鉴于和他打交道的人都是...
<8-8,BECKETT>I mean, given the kinds of people that he dealt with...

189
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,360
<8-9,EDDIE MCUSIC>没有  乔很会与人相处
<8-9,EDDIE MCUSIC>No. Joe had a way with folks.

190
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,460
<8-9,EDDIE MCUSIC>他很关照他人
<8-9,EDDIE MCUSIC>He'd look out for people.

191
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,700
<9-1,CASTLE>你觉得乔是被随机选中的
<9-1,CASTLE>You think Joe was chosen at random,

192
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,590
<9-1,CASTLE>还是因为他的背景而被杀
<9-1,CASTLE>or do you think he was killed because of his background?

193
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,690
<9-2,BECKETT>事实上  由于这不是葛里逊的小说
<9-2,BECKETT>Well, since this isn't, in fact, a Grisham novel,

194
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,320
<9-2,BECKETT>我觉得我得保持一个开阔的思路
<9-2,BECKETT>I thought I'd keep an open mind.

195
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,150
<9-2,BECKETT>莱恩  能调查一下乔·麦丘茨克的过渡教习所吗
<9-2,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. Can you look into Joe McUsic's halfway house,

196
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,530
<9-2,BECKETT>看看那里是否有人与他有矛盾
<9-2,BECKETT>see if he had problems with anyone there?

197
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,650
<9-3,RYAN>我已经和那里的员工谈过了
<9-3,RYAN>I already spoke with staff.

198
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,710
<9-3,RYAN>他们不记得发生过冲突
<9-3,RYAN>They don't remember any conflicts,

199
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,570
<9-3,RYAN>但为了以防万一
<9-3,RYAN>but they're sending over a

200
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,220
<9-3,RYAN>他们给我发来了一份常驻人员名单
<9-3,RYAN>list of residents in case.

201
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,230
<9-4,ESPOSITO>我们那位失踪的陪审员
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Yo. Our missing juror?

202
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,360
<9-4,ESPOSITO>州警在乔治·华盛顿大桥上发现了他
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Troopers picked him up crossing the G.W. Bridge.

203
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,660
<9-4,ESPOSITO>他们正把他带到局里来
<9-4,ESPOSITO>They're bringing him in now.

204
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,490
<10-1,BECKETT>你出城出得很仓促啊  缪勒先生
<10-1,BECKETT>You were leaving town in a hurry, Mr. Muller.

205
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,540
<10-2,TONY MUELLER>-有什么原因吗  -这不明摆的事吗
<10-2,TONY MUELLER>- Any reason why? - Isn't it obvious?

206
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,290
<10-2,TONY MUELLER>我死定了  老兄
<10-2,TONY MUELLER>I'm marked for death, man.

207
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,710
<10-3,CASTLE>死定了
<10-3,CASTLE>Marked for death?

208
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,070
<10-4,TONY MUELLER>我并没有要求当陪审员  我是被传唤的
<10-4,TONY MUELLER>I didn't ask for jury duty. I was summoned.

209
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,520
<10-4,TONY MUELLER>他们说要我在此时此地出现
<10-4,TONY MUELLER>They said show up at this time at this place.

210
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,460
<10-4,TONY MUELLER>但他们没告诉我被告的哥们儿
<10-4,TONY MUELLER>They failed to mention that the defendant's homeboy

211
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,450
<10-5,CASTLE>-会来杀我  -被告的哥们儿
<10-5,CASTLE>- was gonna kill me. - The defendant's homeboy?

212
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,900
<10-6,TONY MUELLER>没错  是个又壮又凶的黑人
<10-6,TONY MUELLER>Yeah. This big scary black guy.

213
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,590
<10-7,BECKETT>到底发生了什么  缪勒先生
<10-7,BECKETT>Exactly what happened, Mr. Muller?

214
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,940
<10-8,TONY MUELLER>昨天  这家伙尾随我到法庭的厕所里
<10-8,TONY MUELLER>Yesterday, this guy follows me into the courthouse bathroom

215
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,330
<10-8,TONY MUELLER>然后开始和我聊关于审判的事
<10-8,TONY MUELLER>and starts chatting me up about the trial.

216
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,060
<10-9,BECKETT>-他告诉你他叫什么了吗  -没有
<10-9,BECKETT>- Did he give you his name? - No, no.

217
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,660
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>但他一直不停地说奥蒂斯·威廉斯是清白的
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>But he's going on and on about how Otis Williams is innocent

218
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,860
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>他是如何被司法体系所陷害的
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>and how he's being railroaded by the system.

219
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,110
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>结果今早  我在被告的
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>And then this morning, I see the same guy

220
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,640
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>旁听席前排看到了他
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>on the defendant's side of the gallery

221
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,330
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>他在盯着我看
<10-10,TONY MUELLER>in the front row, eyeballing me.

222
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,250
<10-11,BECKETT>你以前看过他和乔在一起吗
<10-11,BECKETT>Have you ever seen him with Joe?

223
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,020
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>见过  所以当我看到乔在我眼前
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>Yes, which is why when I saw Joe bite it

224
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,430
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>挂掉时  我知道我就是下一个
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>right in front of me, I knew I was next.

225
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,850
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>干嘛要我去死
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>And why should I die?

226
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,800
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>我只不过在努力履行我的公民义务罢了
<10-12,TONY MUELLER>I was only trying to fulfill my civic responsibilities.

227
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,080
<11-1,BECKETT>谢谢你来这一趟  缪勒先生
<11-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming in, Mr. Muller.

228
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,920
<11-1,BECKETT>你认为你能把他的长相
<11-1,BECKETT>Now do you think you'll be able to describe him

229
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,050
<11-1,BECKETT>描述给我们的速描师吗
<11-1,BECKETT>to our sketch artist?

230
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,960
<11-2,TONY MUELLER>他是个又壮又凶的黑人
<11-2,TONY MUELLER>He--he's a big scary black guy.

231
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,380
<11-3,CASTLE>如果你能说得再具体点就会有所帮助
<11-3,CASTLE>It might help if you're just a little more specific.

232
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,420
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>好吧
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>Uh, okay. Uh...

233
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,310
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>就像我所说的  他是...
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>Well, like I said, he's a--

234
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,930
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>他是个又壮又凶的黑人
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>he's a big scary black guy

235
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,390
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>名叫沃德尔·威廉斯
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>named Wardell Williams.

236
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,330
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>是被告的堂弟
<11-4,TONY MUELLER>The defendant's cousin.

237
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,220
<11-5,BECKETT>我...我以为你不知道他是谁
<11-5,BECKETT>I didn't--I thought you didn't know who he was.

238
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,970
<11-6,TONY MUELLER>我是不知道  不过他不就在那儿吗
<11-6,TONY MUELLER>I didn't, but there he is.

239
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,250
<11-8,TONY MUELLER>-你确定吗  -当然
<11-8,TONY MUELLER>- Well, a-are you sure? - Yeah.

240
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,050
<11-9,BECKETT>为什么这么问
<11-9,BECKETT>Why?

241
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,550
<11-10,RYAN>你们在审讯缪勒先生的时候
<11-10,RYAN>While you guys were in the box with Mr. Muller,

242
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,460
<11-10,RYAN>我在法庭的监控录像上发现了这个
<11-10,RYAN>I-I found this on courthouse surveillance.

243
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,620
<11-10,RYAN>看  那是陪审员乔在咖啡机旁
<11-10,RYAN>See, that's Joe the juror at the coffee machine

244
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,110
<11-10,RYAN>大约在他死前14分钟  正好在谋杀时间区内
<11-10,RYAN>roughly 14 minutes before his death, right in our kill zone.

245
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,670
<11-12,RYAN>-是堂弟沃德尔  -再看这个
<11-12,RYAN>- Cousin Wardell. - And watch this.

246
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,300
<11-13,CASTLE>看上去他给乔了一杯死亡咖啡
<11-13,CASTLE>Looks like he makes a killer cup of Joe.

248
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,100
<11-14,CASTLE>玩笑开得太早了吗
<11-14,CASTLE>Too soon?

251
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:06,810
<11-14,CASTLE>翻译：咖啡十三   cam小池   深深   落末一地   LyraL   思无邪   irene430

253
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,460
<12-1,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你们就想用这种粗制滥造的
<12-1,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Now y'all trying to accuse me of murder

254
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,000
<12-1,WARDELL WILLIAMS>泽普鲁德电影来指控我犯了谋杀罪吗
<12-1,WARDELL WILLIAMS>with this half-assed version of a Zapruder film?

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,290
<12-2,BECKETT>你和奥蒂斯不仅仅是堂兄弟的关系
<12-2,BECKETT>You and Otis were more than just cousins.

257
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,070
<12-2,BECKETT>在同一家庭里长大
<12-2,BECKETT>Grew up in the same household.

258
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,550
<12-2,BECKETT>更像是亲兄弟
<12-2,BECKETT>More like brothers.

259
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,630
<12-3,WARDELL WILLIAMS>没错  我和奥蒂斯关系很铁  那又怎样
<12-3,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Yeah, me and O. tight. So what?

260
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,570
<12-4,CASTLE>这就说明你会为他做一切事情
<12-4,CASTLE>So it makes sense you'd do anything him,

261
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,000
<12-4,CASTLE>包括杀死一位审判他谋杀案的陪审员
<12-4,CASTLE>including kill a juror on his murder trial.

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,580
<12-5,WARDELL WILLIAMS>老兄  你们太扯了
<12-5,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Man, y'all reaching.

263
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,930
<12-6,BECKETT>是吗
<12-6,BECKETT>Are we?

264
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,160
<12-6,BECKETT>你和陪审员交谈过  那可是操纵陪审团
<12-6,BECKETT>You talked to jurors. That's jury tampering.

265
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,570
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>就是说起诉一个并没有犯罪的黑人
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>So accusing one black man of a murder he didn't commit

266
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,050
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>对你们来说还不满足  你们在尝试双赌法吗
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>isn't good enough for you? Y'all trying for the daily double?

268
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,970
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>我和那个法庭里面的很多人都聊过天
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Man, I talked to a gang of folks in that courthouse.

269
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,920
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>我怎么会知道他们中哪个人是陪审员
<12-7,WARDELL WILLIAMS>How I'm supposed to know which one of them is a juror?

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,020
<12-8,CASTLE>他们衣服上"陪审员"的徽章
<12-8,CASTLE>Well, the "Juror" badges on their shirts

271
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,010
<12-8,CASTLE>-也许是个不错的提示  -通过监控视频的镜头
<12-8,CASTLE>- might have been a hint. - Using video surveillance footage

272
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,710
<12-9,BECKETT>鉴证组成功地从垃圾箱中找到了乔的咖啡杯
<12-9,BECKETT>C.S.U. managed to pull joe's coffee cup out of the garbage.

273
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,790
<12-9,BECKETT>他们在检测是否含有氰化物
<12-9,BECKETT>They're testing it for cyanide.

274
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,350
<12-9,BECKETT>你为何不在我们还能谈条件时
<12-9,BECKETT>Why don't you just come clean

275
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,700
<12-9,BECKETT>交待事实呢
<12-9,BECKETT>while we still got a deal to make?

276
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,400
<12-10,WARDELL WILLIAMS>我跟你说过了  我什么也没做
<12-10,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Man, I told you, I didn't do nothin'!

277
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,590
<12-11,BECKETT>沃德尔  坐下  别逼我动粗
<12-11,BECKETT>Wardell, sit down before I make you sit down.

278
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,210
<12-12,WARDELL WILLIAMS>很显然  你是那个唱白脸的警察
<12-12,WARDELL WILLIAMS>So obviously, you must be the bad cop.

279
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,300
<12-12,WARDELL WILLIAMS>这样你就是唱红脸的咯
<12-12,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Guess that makes you the good cop.

280
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,780
<12-13,CASTLE>实际上  我不是警察
<12-13,CASTLE>Actually, I'm not a cop.

281
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,960
<12-14,WARDELL WILLIAMS>-你不是警察啊  -卡塞尔先生是位作家
<12-14,WARDELL WILLIAMS>- Oh, you not a cop? - Mr. Castle is a writer.

282
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,480
<12-15,BECKETT>他时不时协助警局办案
<12-15,BECKETT>He consults with the department on occasion.

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
<12-16,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你们是这个套路啊
<12-16,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Oh. So that's how you two do it?

284
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,850
<12-17,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你说假话  你写假话
<12-17,WARDELL WILLIAMS>You tell the lies, you print the lies?

285
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,430
<12-18,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你们就像他们陷害我堂哥那样来陷害我
<12-18,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Man, y'all framing me just like they did my cousin.

286
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,000
<12-18,WARDELL WILLIAMS>那整件事完全是个阴谋
<12-18,WARDELL WILLIAMS>That whole damn thing a conspiracy.

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
<12-19,BECKETT>沃德尔  认真点
<12-19,BECKETT>Wardell, be serious.

288
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,810
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你觉得我不是认真的吗
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>You don't think I'm serious?

289
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,940
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>那告诉我  城里这么多律师
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Then tell me, why of all the lawyers in the city,

290
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,830
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>为什么是地检官接手了奥蒂斯的案子
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>the district attorney is trying Otis' case?

291
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,770
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你不认为这是因为他在竞选市长
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>You don't think it's 'cause he's running for mayor

292
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,940
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>他想通过把我堂哥关起来
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>and he wants to lock my cousin up

293
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,280
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>让他那些有钱有权的白人朋友感觉安全吗
<12-20,WARDELL WILLIAMS>so all his rich, powerful white friends can feel safe?

294
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,620
<12-21,BECKETT>你这么做完全不能帮助你自己
<12-21,BECKETT>Look, you're not doing yourself any favors right now.

295
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,490
<12-22,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你们把一切都设计好了
<12-22,WARDELL WILLIAMS>You just got it all worked out, huh?

296
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,560
<12-22,WARDELL WILLIAMS>你们把我堂哥奥蒂斯塑造成比格·托马斯
<12-22,WARDELL WILLIAMS>You got my cousin O. pulling a Bigger Thomas.

298
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,970
<12-22,WARDELL WILLIAMS>然后你们又指控我杀了这个男人来使他脱罪
<12-22,WARDELL WILLIAMS>And you got me poisoning this man to get him off.

299
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,920
<12-23,CASTLE>看起来是这样的
<12-23,CASTLE>Looks that way.

300
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,940
<12-24,WARDELL WILLIAMS>"看起来"并不代表那是真相
<12-24,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Well, looks don't make it so.

301
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,610
<12-24,WARDELL WILLIAMS>看上去我在给这个男人的咖啡下毒
<12-24,WARDELL WILLIAMS>Looks like I'm poisoning this man's coffee...

302
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,300
<12-24,WARDELL WILLIAMS>其实  我所做的不过是把咖啡递给他
<12-24,WARDELL WILLIAMS>when really, all I did was hand it to him.

303
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
<13-1,BECKETT>-埃斯波西托  -嗯
<13-1,BECKETT>-Hey, esposito. - Hmm?

304
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,210
<13-3,BECKETT>去申请沃德尔住所的搜查令
<13-3,BECKETT>Can you get a warrant for Wardell's place,

305
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,410
<13-3,BECKETT>-看有没有氰化物残留  -马上去
<13-3,BECKETT>- see if there's any traces of cyanide? - You got it.

306
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,630
<13-4,ESPOSITO>正如法律术语中说的  真相大白了
<13-4,ESPOSITO>And as they say in legalese, asked and answered.

307
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,260
<13-5,CASTLE>真可惜  我本以为这件事
<13-5,CASTLE>It's too bad. I was hoping there'd be a little more

308
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,680
<13-5,CASTLE>会牵扯出更多内幕的
<13-5,CASTLE>to the story than that.

309
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,100
<13-6,CASTLE>哼
<13-6,CASTLE>Hmm.

310
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,860
<13-7,BECKETT>你那声"哼"什么意思
<13-7,BECKETT>"Hmm," what?

311
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,220
<13-8,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯说她今天去格林威治村
<13-8,CASTLE>Alexis said she'd be in the village today,

312
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,840
<13-8,CASTLE>但她其实在威廉斯堡
<13-8,CASTLE>but she's over in Williamsburg.

313
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,530
<13-9,BECKETT>你怎么知道她在威廉斯堡
<13-9,BECKETT>Well, how do you know she's in Williamsburg?

314
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,070
<13-10,CASTLE>用卫星定位她手机
<13-10,CASTLE>GPS tracked her phone.

315
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,980
<13-11,BECKETT>你追踪了她手机吗
<13-11,BECKETT>You tracked her phone?

316
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,390
<13-12,CASTLE>是啊  我刚才下载的一个超酷软件
<13-12,CASTLE>Yeah. Super cool app I just downloaded.

317
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,590
<13-12,CASTLE>我能随时掌握她的行踪
<13-12,CASTLE>I can see where she is at anytime.

318
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,630
<13-13,BECKETT>她知道你这么做吗
<13-13,BECKETT>Does she know that you're doing this?

319
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,390
<13-14,CASTLE>你在开玩笑吗  她会杀了我的
<13-14,CASTLE>What, are you kidding? No, she'd kill me.

320
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,410
<13-15,BECKETT>杀你也是你活该
<13-15,BECKETT>And be justified.

321
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,240
<13-16,CASTLE>我是她老爸
<13-16,CASTLE>I'm her father.

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,870
<13-16,CASTLE>要是有什么事  我得知道
<13-16,CASTLE>If something's going on, I-I need to know.

323
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,560
<13-16,CASTLE>很多家长
<13-16,CASTLE>A lot of parents

324
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,020
<13-16,CASTLE>都喜欢翻孩子的抽屉或是电脑
<13-16,CASTLE>will go through their kids' drawers or computers.

325
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,970
<13-17,CASTLE>这方法温和多了
<13-17,CASTLE>Far less intrusive.

327
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,770
<14-1,LANIE>这是乔掺了氰化物的咖啡杯
<14-1,LANIE>Joe's cyanide-laced coffee cup.

328
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,480
<14-1,LANIE>鉴证组在上面发现乔和沃德尔的指纹
<14-1,LANIE>C.S.U. found both Joe and Wardell's prints on it,

329
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,630
<14-1,LANIE>但少了样重要的东西
<14-1,LANIE>but there was something very important missing.

330
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,970
<14-1,LANIE>氰化物
<14-1,LANIE>Cyanide.

331
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,590
<14-2,LANIE>-真的  -真的
<14-2,LANIE>- Really? - Really.

332
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,470
<14-3,BECKETT>那他怎么被下毒的
<14-3,BECKETT>Well, how was he poisoned?

333
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,140
<14-4,LANIE>解剖时我在处方缓释胶囊内
<14-4,LANIE>During the autopsy, I discovered cyanide residue

334
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,020
<14-4,LANIE>发现了氰化物残留物
<14-4,LANIE>in a prescription time-release capsule.

335
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,820
<14-5,CASTLE>乔开了氰化物处方药吗
<14-5,CASTLE>So Joe had a prescription for cyanide?

336
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,320
<14-5,CASTLE>不  他的处方药是皮质激素
<14-5,CASTLE>No. He had a prescription for corticosteroids.

337
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,640
<14-6,LANIE>他的内科医生说  他每天早上服一粒
<14-6,LANIE>According to his physician, he took one every morning

338
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,330
<14-6,LANIE>治疗狼疮
<14-6,LANIE>for symptoms from lupus.

339
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,280
<14-6,LANIE>看来有人调换了
<14-6,LANIE>It looks like the killer

340
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,100
<14-6,LANIE>乔的胶囊内含物
<14-6,LANIE>switched out the contents of Joe's capsule

341
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,150
<14-6,LANIE>放入了氰化物
<14-6,LANIE>and replaced it with the cyanide.

342
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,370
<14-7,BECKETT>就是说乔服药的时候
<14-7,BECKETT>Okay, so then when Joe was taking his medications,

343
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,660
<14-7,BECKETT>-不知不觉就给自己下毒了  -不过还有个问题
<14-7,BECKETT>- he unknowingly poisoned himself. - But here's the rub--

344
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,950
<14-8,LANIE>因为放入氰化物的缓释胶囊
<14-8,LANIE>since the cyanide was in a time-release capsule

345
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,550
<14-8,LANIE>并不是设计成溶解于胃里的
<14-8,LANIE>designed not to dissolve in stomach acid,

346
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,820
<14-9,CASTLE>-而是溶解于肠里  -咱们的时间顺序全乱了
<14-9,CASTLE>- but in the intestines... - Our timeline is all screwed up.

347
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,570
<14-10,BECKETT>没错  实际上乔
<14-10,BECKETT>Yep, turns out Joe

348
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,600
<14-11,LANIE>是在死前一小时左右被下毒的
<14-11,LANIE>was poisoned almost one hour before his death

349
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,060
<14-11,LANIE>也就是8点13分
<14-11,LANIE>at 8:13 this morning.

350
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,510
<14-12,BECKETT>那时他都还没抵达法院
<14-12,BECKETT>That's before he even got to the courthouse.

351
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,390
<14-13,CASTLE>说明凶手可能也不在那里
<14-13,CASTLE>Which means the killer probably wasn't there either.

352
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,900
<14-14,BECKETT>就是说乔的死或许跟这场审判根本没关系
<14-14,BECKETT>Then Joe's death might not have anything to do with the trial.

353
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,660
<14-15,CASTLE>我们得知了三个重要线索
<14-15,CASTLE>Well, we learned three very important things.

354
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,970
<14-15,CASTLE>第一  凶手足够恶毒
<14-15,CASTLE>Firstly, our killer is diabolical.

355
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,210
<14-15,CASTLE>居然能让人稀里糊涂的自杀
<14-15,CASTLE>You let someone unwittingly kill themselves?

356
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,130
<14-15,CASTLE>太邪恶了
<14-15,CASTLE>Pure evil.

357
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,980
<14-15,CASTLE>第二  凶手了解乔  至少了解他的习惯
<14-15,CASTLE>Second, our killer knew joe or at least knew his habits.

358
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,100
<14-15,CASTLE>-第三  凶手是女人  -啊
<14-15,CASTLE>- Third, our killer was a woman. - Hmm?

359
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,560
<14-17,CASTLE>从统计学角度看  下毒这种手段
<14-17,CASTLE>Statistically speaking, poisonings are almost always

360
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,150
<14-17,CASTLE>-女人才会用  -但你遗漏了
<14-17,CASTLE>- carried out by the fairer sex. - Ah, but you are missing

361
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,000
<14-18,BECKETT>-一个非常重要的细节  卡塞尔  -点醒我
<14-18,BECKETT>- one very important detail, Castle. - Enlighten me.

362
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,290
<14-19,CASTLE>凶手能接触到乔的药物
<14-19,CASTLE>Our killer had access to Joe's medications,

363
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,200
<14-20,BECKETT>这些药物他根本不带在自己身上
<14-20,BECKETT>medications that he did not keep on him.

364
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,950
<14-20,BECKETT>-就是说凶手能接触到他的...  -他的住处
<14-20,BECKETT>- So therefore our killer had access to... - his apartment.

365
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,900
<14-22,BECKETT>没错
<14-22,BECKETT>Bingo.

366
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,290
<15-1,RYAN>纽约警察
<15-1,RYAN>NYPD.

367
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,510
<15-2,ESPOSITO>我说  陪审员乔之死
<15-2,ESPOSITO>You know, the murder of Joe the juror

368
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,800
<15-2,ESPOSITO>真是一场悲剧
<15-2,ESPOSITO>is a real tragedy.

369
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,410
<15-3,RYAN>每宗谋杀不都是悲剧吗
<15-3,RYAN>Isn't every murder a tragedy?

370
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,980
<15-4,ESPOSITO>对  每宗谋杀都是悲剧  但乔很特别
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Yes, every murder's a tragedy, but Joe is special.

371
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,070
<15-4,ESPOSITO>他曾是少年犯  他改过自新
<15-4,ESPOSITO>He was a juvenile delinquent who reformed himself,

372
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,410
<15-4,ESPOSITO>重新做人
<15-4,ESPOSITO>a born-again citizen

373
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,860
<15-4,ESPOSITO>他信任法制  帮助有前科的人
<15-4,ESPOSITO>who believed in the system and helped out ex-cons.

374
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,500
<15-4,ESPOSITO>而他大费周章得到了什么呢
<15-4,ESPOSITO>And what did he get for his trouble?

375
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,570
<15-5,RYAN>一粒满是毒药的胶囊
<15-5,RYAN>Hmm. Pill full of poison.

376
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,370
<15-6,ESPOSITO>"懦夫在未死以前  就已经死过好多次
<15-6,ESPOSITO>"Cowards die many times before their death.

377
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,220
<15-7,RYAN>勇士一生只死一次"
<15-7,RYAN>The valiant never taste of death but once."

378
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,670
<15-8,ESPOSITO>老兄  你可不是卡塞尔
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Bro, you're not Castle.

379
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,290
<15-9,RYAN>我知道我不是卡塞尔
<15-9,RYAN>Yeah, I know I'm not Castle.

380
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,510
<15-10,ESPOSITO>那就别再学他讲话
<15-10,ESPOSITO>Then stop trying to talk like him.

381
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,080
<15-11,RYAN>难道我就不能引用一下诗人的言语吗
<15-11,RYAN>What, I'm not allowed to reference the bard?

382
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,940
<15-12,RYAN>我可是很多才多艺的
<15-12,RYAN>I'm a renaissance man.

383
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,530
<15-13,ESPOSITO>背一句名言可算不上是多才多艺
<15-13,ESPOSITO>Memorizing one quote does not make you a renaissance man.

384
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,180
<15-14,RYAN>那我背两句呢
<15-14,RYAN>What if I memorized two?

385
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,990
<15-15,ESPOSITO>你背够两句了吗
<15-15,ESPOSITO>Have you memorized two?

386
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,410
<15-16,RYAN>还没  要是我能呢
<15-16,RYAN>No, but what if I did?

387
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,440
<15-17,ESPOSITO>那就看你背什么了
<15-17,ESPOSITO>Depends on the quote.

388
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,740
<15-18,ESPOSITO>你这家伙是谁
<15-18,ESPOSITO>Now who the hell are you?

389
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,310
<16-1,RYAN>汉克·庞泽尔
<16-1,RYAN>Hank Ponzell,

390
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,390
<16-1,RYAN>乔·麦丘茨克过渡教习所的前任常驻人员
<16-1,RYAN>former resident of Joe McUsic's halfway house,

391
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,890
<16-1,RYAN>直到乔拒绝了你的延期并把你赶出去
<16-1,RYAN>until you were kicked out when Joe denied your extension.

392
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,460
<16-2,ESPOSITO>-你肯定很恼火  汉克  -你们不明白
<16-2,ESPOSITO>- That had to make you mad, huh, Hank? - You don't understand.

393
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,770
<16-3,HANK PONZELL>不  我们明白  乔把你逼得走投无路
<16-3,HANK PONZELL>Oh, no. I think we do. Joe kicked you to the curb,

394
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,770
<16-4,ESPOSITO>于是你就给他下毒
<16-4,ESPOSITO>and you poisoned him.

395
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,790
<16-4,ESPOSITO>实验室测试结果表明每一个胶囊里
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Lab report shows that every one of these capsules

396
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,700
<16-4,ESPOSITO>-都有氰化物  -要是我给他下毒
<16-4,ESPOSITO>- tested positive for cyanide. - If I poisoned him,

397
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,560
<16-5,HANK PONZELL>我还待在他公寓里干什么
<16-5,HANK PONZELL>why would I still be in his apartment?

398
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,490
<16-6,RYAN>把剩下的胶囊拿走
<16-6,RYAN>To take the rest of the poisoned pills away

399
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,980
<16-6,RYAN>让我们找不到  就能掩盖你的踪迹
<16-6,RYAN>so we couldn't find them, so you could hide your tracks.

400
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,220
<16-7,HANK PONZELL>我整天都不在屋里
<16-7,HANK PONZELL>I was out of the apartment all day.

401
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,690
<16-7,HANK PONZELL>任何人都可能进去  何况我不会伤害乔的
<16-7,HANK PONZELL>Anyone could've gotten in there. And I would never hurt Joe.

402
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,650
<16-7,HANK PONZELL>他是我朋友
<16-7,HANK PONZELL>He was my friend.

403
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,930
<16-8,RYAN>-就这朋友  -就是
<16-8,RYAN>- Friends like him, huh? - Right?

404
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,940
<16-9,ESPOSITO>我没给他下毒  乔让我待在那里的
<16-9,ESPOSITO>I didn't poison him. Joe was letting me stay there, okay?

405
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,050
<16-10,HANK PONZELL>我在过渡教习所驻留时间到了上限
<16-10,HANK PONZELL>I maxed out my time at the halfway house

406
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,230
<16-10,HANK PONZELL>可我没有地方去
<16-10,HANK PONZELL>and didn't have a place to go.

407
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,230
<16-10,HANK PONZELL>乔破例让我跟他暂住
<16-10,HANK PONZELL>Joe broke the rules and let me crash with him.

408
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,890
<16-11,ESPOSITO>那你干嘛在他衣橱里玩捉迷藏
<16-11,ESPOSITO>Then why were you playing hide-and-go-seek in his closet?

409
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,340
<16-12,HANK PONZELL>我是假释期的重犯
<16-12,HANK PONZELL>I'm a felon on parole.

410
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,100
<16-12,HANK PONZELL>我听到警察来  当罪犯当习惯了  就躲了起来
<16-12,HANK PONZELL>I hear cops, and my ex-con instincts kick in.

411
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,160
<16-13,ESPOSITO>好吧  如果你是在改造自己
<16-13,ESPOSITO>Okay, if you were there on the up-and-up,

412
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,910
<16-13,ESPOSITO>那告诉我们  乔有什么麻烦吗
<16-13,ESPOSITO>tell us, was Joe in any kind of trouble?

413
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,920
<16-14,RYAN>听着老兄
<16-14,RYAN>Look, buddy,

414
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,740
<16-14,RYAN>我觉得你没太弄明白你的处境
<16-14,RYAN>I don't think you appreciate the situation you're in.

415
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,400
<16-14,RYAN>你还在假释期
<16-14,RYAN>You are on parole,

416
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,250
<16-14,RYAN>却卷入谋杀案调查之中
<16-14,RYAN>and you're up to your neck in a homicide investigation.

417
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,680
<16-14,RYAN>你最好老实交代  不然我们会在
<16-14,RYAN>Now you better start talking, or we're gonna have you

418
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,530
<16-14,RYAN>纽约新新监狱晚上点名前把你送回去
<16-14,RYAN>back in Sing Sing before the evening roll call.

419
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,510
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>好吧  乔让我帮他跑腿
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>All right. Joe had me run errands for him, okay?

420
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,330
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>取干洗的衣服  去趟酒窖什么的
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>Pick up laundry, go to the bodega, stuff like that.

421
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,910
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>几个周前  他给了我个信封
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>A few weeks ago, he gave me an envelope

422
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,200
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>-让我带给一位女士  -信封里是什么
<16-15,HANK PONZELL>- and told me to take it to this lady. - What was in the envelope?

423
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,440
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>现金  大概有两千美金
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>Cash. Like 2 grand.

424
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,990
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>但我发誓不知道那是要做什么
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>But I don't know what it was for. I swear.

425
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,490
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>乔总是在谈论他如何脱离了犯罪生涯
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>Joe always talked about how he got out of the criminal life,

426
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,060
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>但或许他还没金盆洗手
<16-17,HANK PONZELL>but maybe he still had a foot in.

427
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,840
<16-18,ESPOSITO>你把那个信封给了哪位女士
<16-18,ESPOSITO>Who was this lady that you delivered the envelope to?

428
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,210
<17-1,BECKETT>詹金斯女士
<17-1,BECKETT>Ms. Jenkins?

429
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,010
<17-2,SANDY JENKINS>我是
<17-2,SANDY JENKINS>Yes.

430
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,670
<17-3,BECKETT>你是不是住在西端大道3751号
<17-3,BECKETT>Do you live at 3751 West End Ave.?

431
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,200
<17-5,BECKETT>-是  -我们得谈谈
<17-5,BECKETT>- Yes. - We need to chat.

432
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,060
<17-6,SANDY JENKINS>是我做的  是我做的  是我做的
<17-6,SANDY JENKINS>I did it. I did it. I did it.

433
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,810
<17-7,CASTLE>你杀了他
<17-7,CASTLE>You killed him?

434
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,640
<17-8,SANDY JENKINS>我的天  当然没有
<17-8,SANDY JENKINS>Oh, my god, no. Of course not.

435
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,770
<17-8,SANDY JENKINS>你怎么会这么想
<17-8,SANDY JENKINS>Why would you think that?

436
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,230
<17-9,CASTLE>因为你刚才说"是我做的"
<17-9,CASTLE>Because you just said "I did it."

437
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,990
<17-10,SANDY JENKINS>不不不  不是谋杀  天啊
<17-10,SANDY JENKINS>Oh, no, no, not murder. No, god.

438
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,830
<17-10,SANDY JENKINS>我做了别的  很...糟糕的事
<17-10,SANDY JENKINS>I-I did something else. Something... awful.

439
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,460
<17-11,BECKETT>詹金斯女士  你是法庭书记员
<17-11,BECKETT>Ms. Jenkins, you're the court clerk.

440
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,560
<17-11,BECKETT>乔·麦丘茨克为什么会给你那么多钱
<17-11,BECKETT>Why did Joe McUsic give you that much money?

441
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,620
<17-12,SANDY JENKINS>他付钱让我送他上陪审席
<17-12,SANDY JENKINS>He paid me to put him on that jury.

442
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,670
<18-1,SANDY JENKINS>乔·麦丘茨克找到我
<18-1,SANDY JENKINS>Joe McUsic came to me

443
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,160
<18-1,SANDY JENKINS>说他想履行陪审职责
<18-1,SANDY JENKINS>and said he wanted to serve his jury duty.

444
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,740
<18-1,SANDY JENKINS>我没觉得有什么问题
<18-1,SANDY JENKINS>I didn't see the harm.

445
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,360
<18-2,BECKETT>当然了  尤其你还能小赚一笔
<18-2,BECKETT>Sure. I mean, especially if you're gonna make a profit.

446
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,600
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>我的室友两个月前搬走了
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>My roommate moved out two months ago.

447
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,940
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>我需要钱付房租  我就想
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>I needed the extra cash for rent, and I figured,

448
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,150
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>神不知鬼不觉嘛  不过是陪审职责
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>who's gonna know? I mean, it's jury duty.

449
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,230
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>拜托了  千万不要送我去监狱
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>Please, please, don't send me to prison.

450
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,060
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>我一天到晚  见识过被送往监狱的女人什么样
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>All day long, I-I see the women who get sent there,

451
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,320
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>我应付不了
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>and... I can't hack it.

452
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,210
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>早餐前我就会变成某个终身囚犯的"婊子"的
<18-3,SANDY JENKINS>I'll be some lifer's bitch before breakfast.

453
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,030
<18-4,BECKETT>乔是专门要求
<18-4,BECKETT>Okay, Joe specifically asked

454
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,150
<18-4,BECKETT>参加奥蒂斯·威廉斯的庭审的吗
<18-4,BECKETT>to be on Otis Williams' trial?

455
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,440
<18-5,SANDY JENKINS>是的  他打定主意要进入那次审判的陪审池
<18-5,SANDY JENKINS>Yes. He was insistent about getting on that jury pool.

456
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,610
<18-6,BECKETT>他说了原因吗
<18-6,BECKETT>Did he tell you why?

457
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,870
<18-6,BECKETT>没有  不过那可是莱拉·埃迪森一案
<18-6,BECKETT>No, but it was the Lyla Addison case,

458
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,450
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>我就猜测他是想写一本
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>so I figured maybe he wanted to write

459
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,620
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>揭露案件的书之类的
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>a tell-all book about it or something.

460
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,280
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>我发誓  我只是把他弄进陪审池
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>I-I swear, all I did was put him in the pool.

461
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,430
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>他是自己通过陪审团挑选的
<18-7,SANDY JENKINS>He got through jury selection on his own.

462
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,370
<19-1,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托查看了乔的电脑
<19-1,BECKETT>Ryan and Esposito looked at Joe's computer.

463
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,040
<19-1,BECKETT>里面没有任何他在写有关案件的书
<19-1,BECKETT>There's no evidence that he was writing a book

464
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,480
<19-1,BECKETT>或记录案件的迹象
<19-1,BECKETT>or even taking notes on the trial.

465
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,630
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>一个陪审员把自己买进了陪审团却遭谋杀
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>So a murdered juror just bought himself on to the jury,

466
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,290
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>而我们还一点头绪都没有
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>and we still have no idea why?

467
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,980
<19-3,CASTLE>凶杀  谜案
<19-3,CASTLE>A murder, a mystery,

468
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,150
<19-3,CASTLE>融合了法庭惊悚情节
<19-3,CASTLE>wrapped up inside a courtroom thriller--

469
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,100
<19-3,CASTLE>约翰·葛里逊竟然没写这本书
<19-3,CASTLE>I can't believe John Grisham hasn't written this book.

470
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,270
<19-4,MONTGOMERY>我倒希望他写了  我们或许就能知道
<19-4,MONTGOMERY>I wish he had, maybe then we'd know

471
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,160
<19-4,MONTGOMERY>那案子对乔有何特殊之处了
<19-4,MONTGOMERY>what was so special about that trial to Joe.

472
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,760
<19-5,BECKETT>可能乔和这件案子有点个人联系
<19-5,BECKETT>Well, maybe Joe had a personal connection to the trial--

473
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,610
<19-5,BECKETT>比如和被害人莱拉·埃迪森
<19-5,BECKETT>to the victim, Lyla Addison,

474
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,540
<19-5,BECKETT>或和被告奥蒂斯·威廉斯
<19-5,BECKETT>or to the defendant, Otis Williams.

475
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,740
<19-6,MONTGOMERY>乔有少年犯罪记录吗
<19-6,MONTGOMERY>Doesn't Joe have a juvie record?

476
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,600
<19-7,BECKETT>-有  -要是他以前就认识奥蒂斯呢
<19-7,BECKETT>- Mm-hmm.  - What if he knew Otis from back in the day?

477
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,420
<19-8,MONTGOMERY>他们可能一起被抓过
<19-8,MONTGOMERY>They could've gotten arrested together

478
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,860
<19-8,MONTGOMERY>或同在一所青少年拘留所待过
<19-8,MONTGOMERY>or maybe spent some time in the same juvenile hall.

479
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,300
<19-9,BECKETT>很有可能  我查一下
<19-9,BECKETT>That's a good idea. I'll look into it.

480
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,380
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>还有  我会让人把莱拉·埃迪森一案的
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>Meanwhile, I'll have Lyla Addison's case file

481
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,810
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>资料送过来
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>sent over from the 7-4,

482
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,770
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>你们最好找她的家人再了解一下
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>and you should check in with the family.

483
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,450
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>可能会有所发现
<19-10,MONTGOMERY>Could be a connection there.

484
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,590
<19-11,BECKETT>-好的  -晚安  卡塞尔
<19-11,BECKETT>- Okay.  - Good night, Castle.

485
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,490
<19-12,CASTLE>晚安
<19-12,CASTLE>Night.

<20-2,CASTLE>Did you have a good time in the village?

489
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,620
<20-4,CASTLE>-开心  -还去别处玩了吗
<20-4,CASTLE>- Yeah.  - Go anywhere else?

490
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,540
<20-5,ALEXIS>呃  没有  就在格林威治村
<20-5,ALEXIS>Uh, no. Just stayed in the village.

491
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,790
<20-5,ALEXIS>是吗
<20-5,ALEXIS>Really?

492
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,340
<20-6,CASTLE>我是说  纽约是个大城市
<20-6,CASTLE>I mean, New York is a big city.

493
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,070
<20-6,CASTLE>有很多个区呢
<20-6,CASTLE>Lots of boroughs.

494
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,400
<20-7,ALEXIS>是啊  但我就在曼哈顿区玩
<20-7,ALEXIS>Yeah, but I just stayed in Manhattan.

495
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,340
<20-8,CASTLE>你没去  布鲁克林区吗
<20-8,CASTLE>So you didn't go to, uh... Brooklyn?

496
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,620
<20-8,CASTLE>这时候的威廉斯堡很漂亮
<20-8,CASTLE>Williamsburg is beautiful this time of year.

497
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,080
<20-9,ALEXIS>你怎么知道的
<20-9,ALEXIS>How did you know?

498
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,710
<20-10,CASTLE>我朋友告诉我的  他去了那儿  看到了你
<20-10,CASTLE>A friend of mine told me. He went there. He saw you.

499
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,150
<20-11,ALEXIS>哪个朋友
<20-11,ALEXIS>What friend?

500
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,480
<20-12,CASTLE>很好的朋友  JJ·亚当斯
<20-12,CASTLE>A close friend. J.J... Adams.

501
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,570
<20-13,ALEXIS>抽动鼻子  露馅了  你在撒谎
<20-13,ALEXIS>Nose twitch. That's your tell. You're lying.

502
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,660
<20-14,CASTLE>-不  我没撒谎  -那JJ·亚当斯是谁
<20-14,CASTLE>- No, I'm not.  - Then who is J.J. Adams?

503
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,460
<20-16,CASTLE>他是我一个朋友
<20-16,CASTLE>He's a friend of mine.

504
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,130
<20-17,ALEXIS>等等  JJ·亚当斯是莱斯利·尼尔森
<20-17,ALEXIS>Wait. J.J. Adams was Leslie Nielsen's character name

505
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,120
<20-17,ALEXIS>在《禁忌星球》里所饰演的角色  你绝对是撒谎
<20-17,ALEXIS>in "Forbidden planet." You're totally lying.

506
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,760
<20-17,ALEXIS>你怎么知道我在那里  你找人跟踪我
<20-17,ALEXIS>How did you know where I was? Are you having me followed?

507
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,730
<20-17,ALEXIS>监控我的地铁卡  还是查我的信用卡
<20-17,ALEXIS>Monitoring my metro card? Checking my credit...

508
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,150
<20-17,ALEXIS>手机
<20-17,ALEXIS>My phone.

509
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,760
<20-17,ALEXIS>爸爸  告诉我你没有追踪我的手机
<20-17,ALEXIS>Dad, tell me you are not tracking my phone.

510
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,310
<20-18,CASTLE>听我说  我做了什么不重要
<20-18,CASTLE>Okay, look, this is not about what I did.

511
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,900
<20-18,CASTLE>重要的是你做了什么  你骗了我
<20-18,CASTLE>It's about what you did. You lied to me.

512
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
<20-19,ALEXIS>侵犯自己女儿民事权利的人  还好意思说这个
<20-19,ALEXIS>Says the man who violated his daughter's civil rights.

513
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,570
<20-20,CASTLE>等等  严格来说  我是政府部门的话
<20-20,CASTLE>Okay, technically, I would have to be the government

514
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,300
<20-21,ALEXIS>-才算是侵犯  -你在监视我的一举一动
<20-21,ALEXIS>- to violate--  - You're tracking my every move.

515
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,980
<20-22,CASTLE>不是一举一动
<20-22,CASTLE>Not your every move.

516
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,100
<20-23,ALEXIS>欢迎来到乔治·奥威尔的《1984》
<20-23,ALEXIS>Welcome to George Orwell's "1984,"

517
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,010
<20-23,ALEXIS>-由我父亲扮演大老哥  -这不是
<20-23,ALEXIS>- with my father as Big Brother.  - This isn't about--

518
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,910
<20-25,ALEXIS>下一步要怎样  在我脑子里放芯片吗
<20-25,ALEXIS>What's next, a chip in my brain?

519
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,050
<20-26,CASTLE>你要是对我有所隐瞒  我会想尽办法知道的
<20-26,CASTLE>Whatever it takes when you're keeping secrets from me.

520
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,230
<20-27,ALEXIS>我告诉你  既然你对我的事这么感兴趣
<20-27,ALEXIS>You know what? If you're so interested in what I'm doing,

521
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,470
<20-27,ALEXIS>何不问你的手机呢
<20-27,ALEXIS>why don't you ask your phone?

522
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,060
<20-27,ALEXIS>肯定有这方面的软件
<20-27,ALEXIS>I'm sure there's an app for that.

523
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,610
<21-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你这是自食其果
<21-1,BECKETT>You had it coming, Castle.

524
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,690
<21-1,BECKETT>你有世界上最乖巧的孩子
<21-1,BECKETT>I mean, you have the best kid in the world,

525
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,950
<21-1,BECKETT>却把她当犯人一样对待
<21-1,BECKETT>and you treated her like a common criminal.

526
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,090
<21-2,CASTLE>可能她就是呢
<21-2,CASTLE>Maybe she is, though.

527
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,470
<21-2,CASTLE>我还是不明白她为什么撒谎
<21-2,CASTLE>I still don't know why she lied about

528
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,290
<21-2,CASTLE>说没去威廉斯堡
<21-2,CASTLE>going to williamsburg.

529
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,300
<21-3,BECKETT>你可能永远也不会知道了
<21-3,BECKETT>And you probably never will,

530
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,470
<21-3,BECKETT>除非你打算对她施用水刑
<21-3,BECKETT>unless you plan on waterboarding her.

531
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,430
<21-4,CASTLE>说实话  我做的真的很过分吗
<21-4,CASTLE>Honestly, is what I did so wrong?

532
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,610
<21-5,BECKETT>我觉得那对阿丽克西斯来说不重要
<21-5,BECKETT>I don't really think that it matters to Alexis.

533
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,540
<21-5,BECKETT>重要的是你打破了她对你的信任
<21-5,BECKETT>I mean, you broke her trust.

534
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,740
<21-5,BECKETT>是的  我知道
<21-5,BECKETT>Yeah, I know.

535
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,950
<21-6,CASTLE>那我现在该怎么办
<21-6,CASTLE>So what do I do now?

536
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,150
<21-7,BECKETT>把它赢回来
<21-7,BECKETT>Win it back.

537
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,580
<21-7,BECKETT>走吧  莱拉的家人在等着呢
<21-7,BECKETT>Come on. Lyla's family's waiting.

538
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,170
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>没有  除了在陪审员席我没见过他
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>No, I've never seen him outside the jury box.

539
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,480
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>其他人也没见过
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>Don't think any of us have.

540
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,440
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>一个陪审员为了进入陪审团而行贿
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>Well, a juror bribing his way onto a trial?

541
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,850
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>在我25年的检察官生涯中
<22-1,RANDOLPH ADDISON>I've never in my 25 years as a prosecutor

542
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,750
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>-还从未遇到这类情况  -埃迪森先生
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>- seen anything like it.  - Mr. Addison,

543
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,280
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>有没有可能你女儿认识这个人
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>Is it at all possible that your daughter knew this man?

544
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,850
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>不可能
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>No.

545
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,240
<22-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>史蒂芬
<22-3,RANDOLPH ADDISON>Stephen?

546
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,280
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>我妹妹大部分的朋友我都认识
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>I know most of my sister's friends.

547
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,030
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>他不在其中
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>He's not one of 'em.

548
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,410
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>如果是她的朋友的话  他为什么要这么做呢
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>And if he was, why would he have done this?

549
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,060
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>他为什么要让我妹妹的公正受到威胁呢
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>Why would he put my sister's shot at justice in jeopardy?

550
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,660
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>罗伊  我想不必我多说
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>Roy, I don't think I need to tell you

551
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,700
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>你知道这对城市的法制系统会造成多大的危害
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>how catastrophic this could be to the city's legal system.

552
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,210
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>我希望乔·麦丘茨克谋杀案尽快解决
<22-4,STEPHEN ADDISON>Now I need Joe McUsic's murder solved.

553
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,070
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>-情况有多糟  路  -非常糟
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>- How bad are things, Lou?  - It's pretty bad.

554
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,190
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>今天早上在预先审查时  有陪审团候补人员
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>Just this morning at voir dire, I had potential jurors

555
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,010
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>对自己的人身安全表示担忧
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>expressing fears for their own personal safety.

556
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,470
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>现在纽约市民需要确保
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>Now the people of New York need to be assured

557
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,830
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>他们是受到保护的
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>that they are protected.

558
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,870
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>及时通知我案情进展
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>Keep me in the loop.

559
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,300
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>我指挥12分局这么多年
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>In all the years I've been in command of the 12th precinct,

560
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,130
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>你们知道地检官来过多少次吗
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>you know how many times the district attorney has shown up?

561
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,700
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>一次  就在今天
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>Once. Today.

562
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,500
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>-你们都听到了  赶紧做事  -是  长官
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>- You heard the man. Let's get to work.  - Yes, sir.

563
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,390
<24-1,CASTLE>乔和莱拉·埃迪森之间没有任何联系
<24-1,CASTLE>There is no Joe connection to Lyla Addison.

564
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,850
<24-1,CASTLE>没有财务往来
<24-1,CASTLE>There's nothing in her financials,

565
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,380
<24-1,CASTLE>案件档案上没有记载  没有邮件往来
<24-1,CASTLE>her murder file, her e-mails,

566
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,250
<24-1,CASTLE>没有短信往来  甚至年鉴上都没提到过
<24-1,CASTLE>her texts, not even her yearbook.

567
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,460
<24-1,CASTLE>乔和莱拉绝对没有任何交集
<24-1,CASTLE>Joe and Lyla have absolutely nothing in common.

568
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,620
<24-2,BECKETT>他们两个似乎
<24-2,BECKETT>It's like the two of them didn't even

569
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,510
<24-3,ESPOSITO>-生活在两个不同的星球  -乔和奥蒂斯也是
<24-3,ESPOSITO>- live on the same planet.  - Same goes with Joe and Otis.

570
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,380
<24-4,BECKETT>少年犯罪档案里也没任何线索
<24-4,BECKETT>There's no Joe conction in the juvie files?

571
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,590
<24-5,ESPOSITO>没有  都不沾边
<24-5,ESPOSITO>No, not even close.

572
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,410
<24-5,ESPOSITO>乔和奥蒂斯在不同时间被送往不同的
<24-5,ESPOSITO>Joe and Otis were sent to different juvie halls

573
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,600
<24-5,ESPOSITO>拘留所  而且相距十万八千里
<24-5,ESPOSITO>at different times, and they ran in opposite neighborhoods.

574
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,860
<24-6,BECKETT>那他到底为什么这么想进陪审团呢
<24-6,BECKETT>So then why the hell did he want to get on that jury so bad?

575
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,630
<24-7,RYAN>等等  我这里有发现
<24-7,RYAN>Wait a minute I think I got something.

576
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,850
<24-8,BECKETT>找到联系了吗
<24-8,BECKETT>You have a connection?

577
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,740
<24-9,RYAN>根据他的信用卡消费记录  两个月前
<24-9,RYAN>According to his credit card, Joe purchased

578
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,440
<24-9,RYAN>乔在一家电子商店购买了一支
<24-9,RYAN>a pay-as-you-go cell phone from an electronics store

579
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,900
<24-9,RYAN>付费使用的手机
<24-9,RYAN>a couple of months back.

580
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,090
<24-11,RYAN>-然后呢  -他本来就有手机
<24-11,RYAN>-So?  - So he already had a cell phone.

581
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,470
<24-11,RYAN>还买这么个一次性手机干什么呢
<24-11,RYAN>What's he need a burner phone for,

582
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,830
<24-11,RYAN>而且还是匿名的
<24-11,RYAN>especially an anonymous one?

583
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,400
<24-11,RYAN>若他在用的话  手机在哪里呢
<24-11,RYAN>And if he is using it, where is it?

584
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,550
<24-12,BECKETT>好  带一队人去他公寓
<24-12,BECKETT>All right, take a crew to his apartment,

585
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,960
<24-12,BECKETT>看有没有什么线索
<24-12,BECKETT>see what you can find.

586
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,470
<24-12,BECKETT>-那可能就是我们要找的突破口  -是的
<24-12,BECKETT>- That might be the break that we need.  - Yeah.

587
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,110
<24-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  卡塞尔  你能别玩了吗
<24-14,BECKETT>Castle? Castle, can you stop playing around?

588
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,490
<24-14,BECKETT>事实上  我不是在玩
<24-14,BECKETT>Actually, I'm not playing around.

589
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,810
<24-15,CASTLE>我在忙着拨开这件案子的迷雾呢
<24-15,CASTLE>I'm a little busy blowing this case wide open.

590
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,220
<24-15,CASTLE>这是一张案发现场的
<24-15,CASTLE>This is a photograph of the looky loos

591
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,010
<24-15,CASTLE>围观群众的照片
<24-15,CASTLE>at Lyla's crime scene.

592
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,060
<24-15,CASTLE>这是个放大软件
<24-15,CASTLE>This is a little magnification app.

593
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,770
<24-16,CASTLE>认出谁来了吗
<24-16,CASTLE>Recognize anyone?

594
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,730
<24-17,BECKETT>是乔
<24-17,BECKETT>It's Joe.

595
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,450
<24-17,BECKETT>他在莱拉·埃迪森一案的案发现场
<24-17,BECKETT>He was at Lyla Addison's crime scene.

596
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,100
<24-18,ESPOSITO>他为什么会在那里
<24-18,ESPOSITO>Why would he be there?

597
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,520
<24-19,CASTLE>一个公民会出现在凶杀现场
<24-19,CASTLE>Only three reasons for a civilian

598
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,160
<24-19,CASTLE>只有三个原因  一是他们死了
<24-19,CASTLE>to be at a murder scene-- one, they're dead,

599
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,130
<24-19,CASTLE>二是他们碰巧出现在这个区域
<24-19,CASTLE>two, they just happen to be in the immediate area,

600
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,580
<24-19,CASTLE>还有三  就是凶手压抑不住
<24-19,CASTLE>or three, it's our killer, and he couldn't resist

601
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,600
<24-19,CASTLE>返回犯罪现场的冲动
<24-19,CASTLE>the compulsion to return to the scene of the crime.

602
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,900
<24-19,CASTLE>你们觉得乔是属于哪个类型的
<24-19,CASTLE>And which number do you think Joe is?

603
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,580
<24-20,BECKETT>我选第三种
<24-20,BECKETT>I'm gonna go with three.

604
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,450
<24-21,CASTLE>他既是被害人又是凶手
<24-21,CASTLE>He's our victim and our killer.

605
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:03,960
<24-22,ESPOSITO>厉害
<24-22,ESPOSITO>Nice.

606
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,520
<24-23,CASTLE>-疼  -对不起
<24-23,CASTLE>- Ah. - Sorry.

607
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,640
<25-1,CASTLE>乔·麦丘茨克  既是被害人也是凶手
<25-1,CASTLE>Joe McUsic -- victim and killer?

608
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,380
<25-1,CASTLE>这真是最棒的反转
<25-1,CASTLE>This is the best twist yet.

609
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,350
<25-1,CASTLE>乔在自己犯下的谋杀案审判中担当陪审员
<25-1,CASTLE>Joe served on the jury of a murder he committed.

610
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,300
<25-2,BECKETT>是啊  但如果乔逃脱了谋杀的罪名
<25-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but if Joe literally got away with murder,

611
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,450
<25-2,BECKETT>他为什么还要冒这么大的险
<25-2,BECKETT>why would he risk it all

612
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,070
<25-2,BECKETT>通过贿赂的方式成为陪审员呢
<25-2,BECKETT>and bribe his way onto the jury?

613
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,200
<25-3,CASTLE>也许他觉得有义务去救一个清白的人
<25-3,CASTLE>Maybe he felt compelled to save an innocent man.

614
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,330
<25-3,CASTLE>也许他想制造
<25-3,CASTLE>Maybe he wanted to create reasonable doubt

615
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,880
<25-3,CASTLE>一个合理疑点让奥蒂斯脱罪
<25-3,CASTLE>in the deliberation room to get Otis off,

616
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,800
<25-3,CASTLE>就像亨利·方达在《十二怒汉》中的手法一样
<25-3,CASTLE>just like Henry Fonda in "12 Angry Men."

617
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,040
<25-4,BECKETT>又或者他混进陪审团是想确保
<25-4,BECKETT>Or maybe he got onto the jury because he wanted to make sure

618
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,240
<25-4,BECKETT>清白的奥蒂斯被定罪
<25-4,BECKETT>that an innocent Otis got convicted of his crime.

619
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,640
<25-5,CASTLE>不  我还是喜欢"有良心的杀手"这一推理
<25-5,CASTLE>No. I like my "killer with a conscience" theory better.

620
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
<25-6,BECKETT>是吗  好吧  随你怎么喜欢你的推理
<25-6,BECKETT>Yeah? Well, like your theory all you want.

621
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,790
<25-6,BECKETT>我的推理没有那么复杂做作
<25-6,BECKETT>Mine is less convoluted and contrived.

622
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,730
<25-7,ESPOSITO>我不想煞风景  但你们都错了
<25-7,ESPOSITO>I hate to burst bubbles, but you're both wrong.

623
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,290
<25-7,ESPOSITO>莱拉不是乔杀的
<25-7,ESPOSITO>Joe did not kill Lyla.

624
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,070
<25-7,ESPOSITO>他有不在场证明
<25-7,ESPOSITO>He had an alibi.

625
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,700
<25-7,ESPOSITO>我对过渡教习所进行了调查
<25-7,ESPOSITO>I did a background on the halfway house.

626
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,480
<25-7,ESPOSITO>在莱拉被杀的当晚
<25-7,ESPOSITO>On the night Lyla was killed,

627
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,610
<25-7,ESPOSITO>乔在筹款
<25-7,ESPOSITO>Joe was at a fund-raiser.

628
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,700
<25-8,BECKETT>他一直在那待到午夜
<25-8,BECKETT>He was there until midnight.

629
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,710
<25-9,CASTLE>莱拉是在晚上9:30到11:30之间被杀的
<25-9,CASTLE>And Lyla was killed between 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.

630
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,470
<25-10,ESPOSITO>那既然不是他杀的人
<25-10,ESPOSITO>So if he didn't kill her,

631
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,970
<25-10,ESPOSITO>他为什么那么想进陪审团呢
<25-10,ESPOSITO>why did he want to be on the jury so bad?

632
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,160
<25-11,BECKETT>他又为什么会出现在凶案现场
<25-11,BECKETT>And why was he at the crime scene?

633
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,690
<25-11,BECKETT>好吧  现在我们知道
<25-11,BECKETT>Okay, so we know

634
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,620
<25-12,CASTLE>乔做陪审员有不可告人的目的
<25-12,CASTLE>that Joe was a juror with a hidden agenda.

635
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,190
<25-12,CASTLE>他被卷入了这场高调的案子
<25-12,CASTLE>He was embroiled in a high-profile case

636
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,130
<25-12,CASTLE>地方检察官亲自接手此案
<25-12,CASTLE>being tried by the D.A. himself.

637
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,760
<25-12,CASTLE>但他还没能完成他预谋之事
<25-12,CASTLE>But before he could accomplish what he set out to do,

638
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,520
<25-12,CASTLE>就被暗中的强大势力灭了口
<25-12,CASTLE>he was struck down by powerful, shadowy forces.

639
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,870
<25-13,CASTLE>有什么发现
<25-13,CASTLE>What?

640
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,330
<25-14,BECKETT>我们一定遗漏了某些线索
<25-14,BECKETT>There's gotta be something that we're missing.

641
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,260
<25-14,BECKETT>乔和被告之间一定有
<25-14,BECKETT>There has to be a tangible connection

642
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,540
<25-14,BECKETT>某些实际的关联
<25-14,BECKETT>between Joe and our defendant

643
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,020
<25-14,BECKETT>或者是乔和被害人之间有联系
<25-14,BECKETT>or Joe and our victim.

644
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,430
<25-15,RYAN>又或者是乔和其他人之间有联系
<25-15,RYAN>Or between Joe and somebody else entirely.

645
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,970
<25-15,RYAN>我找到一个手机
<25-15,RYAN>I found a phone.

646
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,090
<25-15,RYAN>藏在书柜的书后面
<25-15,RYAN>It was hiding behind some books in the bookcase.

647
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,310
<25-15,RYAN>乔用它打了十四通电话
<25-15,RYAN>Joe made 14 calls with it,

648
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,420
<25-15,RYAN>全打给了一个号码
<25-15,RYAN>all to the same number.

649
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,770
<25-15,RYAN>地方检察官路·卡耐基的办公室
<25-15,RYAN>District Attorney Lou Karnacki's office.

650
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,020
<25-16,CASTLE>看来地方检察官违反规程了
<25-16,CASTLE>Looks like the D.A. was out of order.

651
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,010
<26-2,DAWN CRAIG>-克雷格太太  -请叫我唐
<26-2,DAWN CRAIG>- Mrs. Craig. - Oh, please. Call me Dawn.

652
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,160
<26-3,BECKETT>唐  你是
<26-3,BECKETT>Dawn, you are

653
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,340
<26-3,BECKETT>我们这的地方检察官的行政助理吧
<26-3,BECKETT>our district attorney's administrative assistant?

654
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,410
<26-4,DAWN CRAIG>是的  从他来这以后一直是我
<26-4,DAWN CRAIG>Yes, ever since he came into office.

655
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,600
<26-5,BECKETT>你印象中有没有收到过
<26-5,BECKETT>Do you remember ever receiving

656
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,830
<26-5,BECKETT>一个叫乔·麦丘茨克的人打来的电话
<26-5,BECKETT>any phone calls from a Joe McUsic?

657
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,610
<26-6,DAWN CRAIG>我们每天都要接成百上千个电话
<26-6,DAWN CRAIG>Ooh. Uh, we get hundreds of calls every day.

658
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,080
<26-6,DAWN CRAIG>好像没听过这么个人
<26-6,DAWN CRAIG>Um, that name doesn't sound familiar.

659
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,500
<26-7,CASTLE>我们有充分的理由证明他打来过很多次
<26-7,CASTLE>We have reason to believe he called numerous times.

660
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,480
<26-7,CASTLE>他也许说过
<26-7,CASTLE>He may have said

661
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,930
<26-7,CASTLE>是关于奥蒂斯·威廉斯的案子的
<26-7,CASTLE>it was regarding the Otis Williams case.

662
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,350
<26-8,DAWN CRAIG>有的
<26-8,DAWN CRAIG>Oh. Uh, yeah.

663
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,660
<26-8,DAWN CRAIG>我是接到过一些奇怪的匿名电话
<26-8,DAWN CRAIG>I did get a series of bizarre anonymous calls

664
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,720
<26-8,DAWN CRAIG>那个男人声称奥蒂斯·威廉斯是无辜的
<26-8,DAWN CRAIG>from a man claiming that Otis Williams was innocent.

665
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,390
<26-9,CASTLE>那人可能就是乔
<26-9,CASTLE>That would be Joe.

666
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,640
<26-9,CASTLE>他有跟地检官通过话吗
<26-9,CASTLE>Did he ever speak to the D.A.?

667
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,680
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>没有  我从没把这些电话转接给他
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>No. I never put him through.

668
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,820
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>我觉得那人就是个疯子
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>I figured he was a wacko.

669
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,480
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>我们经常接到类似的电话
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>Well, you know, we get a lot of these calls,

670
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,330
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>我一半的工作就是把
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>and half my job is to filter out

671
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,060
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>正常的电话从这些疯子电话中过滤出来
<26-10,DAWN CRAIG>the legitimate calls from the crackpots.

672
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,770
<26-11,BECKETT>那他有没有提过别的什么事
<26-11,BECKETT>Did he ever mention anything else?

673
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,210
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>有  他说过他有能让
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>Yeah. He said he had evidence

674
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,380
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>奥蒂斯·威廉斯脱罪的证据
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>that would exonerate Otis Williams,

675
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,620
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>还有他打算把证据寄到
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>and how he was gonna mail it

676
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,260
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>地方检察官的办公室
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>to the District Attorney's office.

677
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,610
<26-13,CASTLE>你收到这个包裹了吗
<26-13,CASTLE>Did you ever get that package?

678
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,990
<26-14,DAWN CRAIG>据我了解没有
<26-14,DAWN CRAIG>Not that I know of.

679
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,700
<26-15,BECKETT>唐  这些电话时长基本上
<26-15,BECKETT>Uh, Dawn, most of these phone calls

680
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,130
<26-15,BECKETT>都不到两分钟
<26-15,BECKETT>are under two minutes long.

681
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,160
<26-15,BECKETT>但是这有一通晚上10:14打的
<26-15,BECKETT>But then there's this one at 10:14 p.m.

682
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,500
<26-15,BECKETT>都超过十分钟了
<26-15,BECKETT>It's over ten minutes long.

683
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,580
<26-15,BECKETT>有没有可能是你接到的这个电话呢
<26-15,BECKETT>Is there any chance that you took that phone call?

684
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,500
<26-16,DAWN CRAIG>不可能  我从来不会待到七点以后
<26-16,DAWN CRAIG>Oh, no. I never stay past 7:00.

685
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,010
<26-17,CASTLE>地方检察官一般工作到几点
<26-17,CASTLE>How late does the D.A. work?

686
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,660
<26-17,CASTLE>谈话结束了
<26-17,CASTLE>This conversation is over.

687
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,970
<26-17,CASTLE>你就这么通知我进展的吗  罗伊
<26-17,CASTLE>This the way you keep me in the loop, Roy?

688
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,650
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>路  这案子进展很快
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>It's a fast-moving case, Lou.

689
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,890
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>我的手下只是跟着证据走
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>My team just followed the evidence where it led them.

690
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,560
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>别用这个搪塞我
<27-1,MONTGOMERY>Oh, don't give me that.

691
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,860
<27-2,BECKETT>我们认识这么久了
<27-2,BECKETT>We've known each other too long.

692
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,590
<27-2,BECKETT>卡耐基先生  乔·麦丘茨克往您办公室
<27-2,BECKETT>Mr. Karnacki, Joe McUsic made several phone calls

693
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,830
<27-2,BECKETT>打了好几通电话
<27-2,BECKETT>to your office.

694
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,340
<27-2,BECKETT>其中有一通通话超过了十分钟
<27-2,BECKETT>One of them lasted over ten minutes.

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,130
<27-2,BECKETT>您跟他说话了吗  长官
<27-2,BECKETT>Did you speak to him, sir?

696
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:34,980
<27-3,BECKETT>那个死了的陪审员
<27-3,BECKETT>The dead juror?

697
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,240
<27-3,BECKETT>-是的  -没有  当然没有
<27-3,BECKETT>- Yes. - No, of course not.

698
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,410
<27-4,CASTLE>他有没有给你寄过一些
<27-4,CASTLE>Did he send you any evidence

699
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,050
<27-4,CASTLE>与奥蒂斯·威廉斯的案子相关的证据
<27-4,CASTLE>that was relevant to the Otis Williams case?

700
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,880
<27-4,CASTLE>抱歉  我想我们还没有正式介绍
<27-4,CASTLE>Excuse me. I don't think we've been introduced.

701
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,510
<27-4,CASTLE>我是那个可以禁止你出入这个分局的人
<27-4,CASTLE>I'm the guy that can get you banned from this precinct.

702
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,750
<27-5,MONTGOMERY>我也可以把你调到港口分局
<27-5,MONTGOMERY>And I can have you transferred to the harbor unit!

703
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,220
<27-5,MONTGOMERY>路  你说过要尽快查出真凶
<27-5,MONTGOMERY>Lou, you said you wanted this murder squared away.

704
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,940
<27-5,MONTGOMERY>我们现在就是这么做的
<27-5,MONTGOMERY>That's all we're doing.

705
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,470
<26-11,BECKETT>不  你们这是在我背后鬼鬼祟祟
<26-11,BECKETT>No, what you're doing is sneaking around behind my back.

706
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,630
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>下次你如果想问话  打电话
<26-12,DAWN CRAIG>Now the next time you want an interview, you call.

707
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,910
<26-13,CASTLE>不要再背着我  把我的任何一个员工
<26-13,CASTLE>And don't you ever, ever, drag one of my staff down here

708
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,360
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>拖到这里来
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>without my knowledge again.

709
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,490
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>你没通知地检官
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>You called in the D.A.'s personal assistant

710
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,170
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>就把他的个人助理叫到这问话了吗
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>without informing him?

711
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,920
<27-7,BECKETT>对不起  长官  我
<27-7,BECKETT>Sir, I'm sorry. I was...I...

712
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,410
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>这招聪明
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>Smart move.

713
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,060
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>没看到刚刚发生的事吗
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>Don't you see what just happened?

714
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,730
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>他本可以打电话询问为什么他的助理在这
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>He could have called and asked why his assistant was here,

715
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,090
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>但是他却亲自过来了
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>but he came in person.

716
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,110
<27-9,BECKETT>他想终止这次问话
<27-9,BECKETT>He wanted to stop the interview.

717
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,530
<27-10,CASTLE>他在掩盖线索
<27-10,CASTLE>He's hiding something.

718
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,660
<28-1,CASTLE>沃德尔·威廉斯是对的  这是场阴谋
<28-1,CASTLE>Wardell Williams was right. It's a conspiracy.

719
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,770
<28-2,BECKETT>我同意
<28-2,BECKETT>I agree.

720
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,220
<28-2,BECKETT>我知道  很怪
<28-2,BECKETT>I know. Weird.

721
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,640
<28-3,CASTLE>是很怪  但是很好
<28-3,CASTLE>Yeah, weird, but good,

722
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,160
<28-3,CASTLE>因为那只是冰山一角
<28-3,CASTLE>because that's just the tip of the iceberg.

723
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,990
<28-3,CASTLE>你准备好"巨轮沉没"了吗
<28-3,CASTLE>Are you ready for the "Titanic"?

724
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,380
<28-4,BECKETT>是的
<28-4,BECKETT>Yes.

725
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,320
<28-5,CASTLE>很好  我在网上挖到了一些料
<28-5,CASTLE>Good. I did a little digging on the internet.

726
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,950
<28-5,CASTLE>猜猜地方检察官最近竞选的
<28-5,CASTLE>Guess who the D.A.'s largest campaign contributors were

727
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,120
<28-5,CASTLE>最大赞助商是谁
<28-5,CASTLE>on his last election?

728
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,230
<28-6,BECKETT>谁
<28-6,BECKETT>Who?

729
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,180
<28-7,CASTLE>鲁道夫和安德亚·埃迪森
<28-7,CASTLE>Randolph and Andrea Addison,

730
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,280
<28-7,CASTLE>是莱拉的父母
<28-7,CASTLE>Lyla's parents.

731
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
<28-7,CASTLE>我的推测是
<28-7,CASTLE>Here's what I'm thinking,

732
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,690
<28-7,CASTLE>悲痛欲绝的父母要声张正义
<28-7,CASTLE>devastated parents demand justice.

733
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,250
<28-7,CASTLE>坚持让地检官亲自接手这个案子
<28-7,CASTLE>Insist that the D.A. try the case personally,

734
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,330
<28-7,CASTLE>也许还暗示卡耐基
<28-7,CASTLE>maybe even suggest to Karnacki

735
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,070
<28-7,CASTLE>想要确保得到他们政治上的支持
<28-7,CASTLE>that he needs to put Lyla's killer away

736
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,370
<28-7,CASTLE>就得把杀死莱拉的凶手定罪
<28-7,CASTLE>in order to secure their political support.

737
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,090
<28-8,BECKETT>当然  卡耐基同意了
<28-8,BECKETT>Of course, and Karnacki agreed

738
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,490
<28-8,BECKETT>因为这本是一起简单的案子
<28-8,BECKETT>because it was gonna be an easy case.

739
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,410
<28-8,BECKETT>因为他们有了奥蒂斯·威廉斯这个嫌疑人
<28-8,BECKETT>I mean, they already had Otis Williams.

740
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,620
<28-8,BECKETT>定罪毫无悬念
<28-8,BECKETT>It was open and shut.

741
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,090
<28-9,CASTLE>直到乔开始打电话
<28-9,CASTLE>Until Joe starts calling,

742
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,640
<28-9,CASTLE>坚持称奥蒂斯是无辜的
<28-9,CASTLE>insisting that Otis is innocent,

743
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,090
<28-9,CASTLE>这对卡耐基很不利
<28-9,CASTLE>which is bad for Karnacki...

744
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,230
<28-9,CASTLE>实际上  最后是对乔不利
<28-9,CASTLE>Actually, in the end, bad for Joe.

745
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,240
<28-10,BECKETT>但是这还是没有解释通
<28-10,BECKETT>You know, but it still doesn't explain

746
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,930
<28-10,BECKETT>为什么乔要靠贿赂进陪审团
<28-10,BECKETT>why Joe bought into the jury pool

747
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,060
<28-10,BECKETT>或者他凭什么认为奥蒂斯·威廉斯就是无辜的
<28-10,BECKETT>or why he thought that Otis Williams was innocent.

748
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,660
<28-10,BECKETT>我是说  如果他有脱罪的证据的话  证据在哪
<28-10,BECKETT>I mean, if he had exonerating evidence, where is it?

749
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,190
<28-10,BECKETT>我们能找的地方都找了
<28-10,BECKETT>We've looked everywhere.

750
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,220
<28-10,BECKETT>能谈的人也都谈了
<28-10,BECKETT>We've talked to everyone.

751
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,320
<28-11,CASTLE>还有漏网之鱼
<28-11,CASTLE>Not everyone.

752
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,180
<29-1,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>正如我之前所说
<29-1,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>As I said before,

753
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,540
<29-1,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>我们来这不是讨论莱拉·埃迪森的案子的
<29-1,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>we're not here to discuss the Lyla Addison case.

754
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:41,910
<29-2,BECKETT>我们也不是
<29-2,BECKETT>Neither are we.

755
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,060
<29-2,BECKETT>我们是想谈谈乔·麦丘茨克的谋杀案
<29-2,BECKETT>We're here to talk about Joe McUsic's murder--

756
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,050
<29-2,BECKETT>7号陪审员
<29-2,BECKETT>Juror number seven.

757
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,240
<29-3,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>你们不是还在纠结
<29-3,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>You're not still suggesting

758
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,630
<29-3,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>我的当事人跟这个案子也有关系吧
<29-3,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>that my client had something to do with that?

759
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,750
<29-4,CASTLE>我们比较倾向于威廉斯先生
<29-4,CASTLE>Uh, we are open to the idea that Mr. Williams

760
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,420
<29-4,CASTLE>跟任何一个案子都没有关系
<29-4,CASTLE>may not be guilty of either murder.

761
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,270
<29-5,BECKETT>如果你能帮我们找出真凶
<29-5,BECKETT>Look, we think that you might be able to help yourself

762
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,270
<29-5,BECKETT>说不定能帮你自己洗脱罪名
<29-5,BECKETT>by helping us find the real killer.

763
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,860
<29-6,BECKETT>这是乔·麦丘茨克
<29-6,BECKETT>This is Joe McUsic.

764
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,060
<29-6,BECKETT>这次审判前你们曾经见过吗
<29-6,BECKETT>Had you ever seen him before the trial?

765
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,200
<29-8,CASTLE>他自称有能证明你清白的证据
<29-8,CASTLE>He claimed to have evidence proving your innocence.

766
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,930
<29-8,CASTLE>你知道可能是什么样的证据吗
<29-8,CASTLE>Do you have any idea what that evidence might be?

767
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,930
<29-9,OTIS WILLIAMS>我怎么知道
<29-9,OTIS WILLIAMS>How am I supposed to know?

768
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,090
<29-10,BECKETT>他靠贿赂进入陪审团
<29-10,BECKETT>He bought his way onto the jury

769
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,410
<29-10,BECKETT>就是为了让你被判无罪
<29-10,BECKETT>in order to get you acquitted

770
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,280
<29-10,BECKETT>并为此送了命
<29-10,BECKETT>and then he got murdered for it.

771
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,410
<29-11,OTIS WILLIAMS>听着  他死了我很遗憾
<29-11,OTIS WILLIAMS>Well, look, I'm sorry he's dead.

772
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,060
<29-11,OTIS WILLIAMS>我很感激他那样为我铤而走险
<29-11,OTIS WILLIAMS>I appreciate a man putting himself out like that for me,

773
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,010
<29-11,OTIS WILLIAMS>但  我真不知道怎么帮你们
<29-11,OTIS WILLIAMS>but I don't know how to help y'all.

774
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,490
<29-12,BECKETT>威廉斯先生  如果你没杀莱拉
<29-12,BECKETT>Mr. Williams, if you didn't kill Lyla,

775
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,120
<29-12,BECKETT>那我们就得找到真凶
<29-12,BECKETT>then we need to figure out who did.

776
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,350
<29-13,CASTLE>你是第一个到达现场的
<29-13,CASTLE>You were first on the scene.

777
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,780
<29-13,CASTLE>你如果记得任何细节
<29-13,CASTLE>Any detail you can remember,

778
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,860
<29-13,CASTLE>不管记得多模糊  都可能帮到我们
<29-13,CASTLE>no matter how obscure, might help us.

779
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,280
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>好吧  那天很晚了
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>A'ight. It was late.

780
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:42,570
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>刚下班  往家走
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>Just got off my job, you know? Walking home...

781
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,910
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>就看到那辆漂亮的宝马760i
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>When I saw that sweet 760i,

782
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,070
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>就停在那  钥匙还插在上面
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>just sitting there, keys in the ignition.

783
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,220
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>我知道我该走开的
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>I knew I shoulda passed it by,

784
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,230
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>但我一直想开一回760
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>but I always wanted to drive a 760,

785
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,470
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>我就跳上车
<29-14,OTIS WILLIAMS>so I jumped in.

786
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,690
<29-15,BECKETT>打断一下  再详细点  看到别人了吗
<29-15,BECKETT>I'm sorry. We need details. So did you see anyone?

787
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,510
<29-17,CASTLE>-没有  -车周围有东西吗
<29-17,CASTLE>- No. - Was there anything around the car?

788
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,570
<29-18,BECKETT>有没有任何迹象表明有人在车里停留过
<29-18,BECKETT>Yeah, anything that might suggest someone else had been there.

789
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,610
<29-18,BECKETT>烟头  口香糖
<29-18,BECKETT>Cigarette butts, uh, chewing gum...

790
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,640
<29-19,CASTLE>鞋迹  高跟鞋印
<29-19,CASTLE>Shoe prints, heel prints?

791
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,170
<29-21,BECKETT>-没有那样的东西  -好吧  然后呢
<29-21,BECKETT>- Nah, nothing like that. - Okay, um, what happened next?

792
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,520
<29-22,OTIS WILLIAMS>我坐进去  把座椅向前调
<29-22,OTIS WILLIAMS>I slid in the ride, pulled the seat up,

793
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,300
<29-22,OTIS WILLIAMS>发动车子
<29-22,OTIS WILLIAMS>hit the ignition...

794
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,270
<29-23,BECKETT>等等  你说你把座椅向前调了
<29-23,BECKETT>Wait, wait. Did you say you pulled the seat up?

795
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,930
<29-25,BECKETT>-对啊  -你确定吗
<29-25,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Are you sure?

796
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,680
<29-26,OTIS WILLIAMS>我确定  座椅很靠后
<29-26,OTIS WILLIAMS>Yeah, I'm sure. That bad boy was all the way back,

797
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,640
<29-26,OTIS WILLIAMS>我就按侧面的按钮把它调向前
<29-26,OTIS WILLIAMS>so I hit the button on the side to move it up.

798
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,310
<29-27,BECKETT>莱拉不过5英尺[约1米5]高
<29-27,BECKETT>Lyla was all of 5-foot-nothing.

799
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,200
<29-27,BECKETT>座椅不会放到那么靠后
<29-27,BECKETT>There's no reason for that seat to have been all the way back.

800
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,670
<29-28,CASTLE>开车的另有其人
<29-28,CASTLE>Somebody else was driving that car,

801
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,670
<29-28,CASTLE>极有可能是凶手
<29-28,CASTLE>most likely our killer.

802
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,690
<29-29,BECKETT>那凶手要移动座椅就要按
<29-29,BECKETT>And our killer would have to press the back button

803
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,590
<29-29,BECKETT>后移钮  鉴证组查指纹了吗
<29-29,BECKETT>in order to move it. Did C.S.U. check for prints?

804
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,430
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>方向盘和仪表盘都查了
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>The steering wheel and the dash.

805
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,430
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>只找到我当事人的指纹
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>The only prints they found were my client's,

806
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,950
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>他又在现场被抓住
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>so when they caught him behind the wheel,

807
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,840
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>所以我想他们大概也没细找
<29-30,ATTORNEY NICK KELLER>I don't think they put much effort into it.

808
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,600
<29-31,BECKETT>莱拉的车在审判期间是没收在库的
<29-31,BECKETT>Lyla's car is still at the impound pending the trial.

809
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,840
<29-31,BECKETT>我们还能让鉴证组查查座椅控制钮的指纹
<29-31,BECKETT>We can still have C.S.U. print the seat controls.

810
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,850
<30-1,CASTLE>座椅控制按钮
<30-1,CASTLE>A seat back button?

811
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,450
<30-1,CASTLE>对一宗谋杀疑案来说这是非常棒的细节
<30-1,CASTLE>What a great detail for a murder mystery.

812
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,970
<30-2,BECKETT>找到指纹  才算棒
<30-2,BECKETT>Only if we get a print.

813
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,290
<30-3,CASTLE>是啊  不然我们只能到处找傻大个了
<30-3,CASTLE>Yes, otherwise, we'll just be looking for tall people.

814
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,300
<30-3,CASTLE>是啊
<30-3,CASTLE>Yeah.

815
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,780
<30-3,CASTLE>爸爸
<30-3,CASTLE>Dad.

816
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,230
<3-1,CASTLE>你好啊
<3-1,CASTLE>Hey.

817
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,590
<30-6,CASTLE>出了什么事吗
<30-6,CASTLE>Everything all right?

818
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,130
<31-1,ALEXIS>对不起  我昨晚冲你吼
<31-1,ALEXIS>I'm sorry for yelling at you last...

819
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,730
<31-2,CASTLE>不不  是我背叛了你的信任
<31-2,CASTLE>No, no, I... I violated your trust.

820
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,960
<31-2,CASTLE>我不该那样监视你
<31-2,CASTLE>I shouldn't have spied on you.

821
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,790
<31-2,CASTLE>那是不对的  我想让你看这个
<31-2,CASTLE>That was wrong. And I want you to see this...

822
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,360
<31-3,CASTLE>我要把这个软件
<31-3,CASTLE>I am deleting that app...

823
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,120
<31-3,CASTLE>永远删掉
<31-3,CASTLE>now and forever.

824
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,620
<31-3,CASTLE>好吗  没了
<31-3,CASTLE>Okay? Gone.

825
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,190
<31-3,CASTLE>对不起
<31-3,CASTLE>So... I'm sorry.

826
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,100
<31-4,ALEXIS>原谅我了吗
<31-4,ALEXIS>Forgive me?

827
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,680
<31-4,ALEXIS>你会原谅我吗
<31-4,ALEXIS>But will you forgive me?

828
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,030
<31-5,CASTLE>当然
<31-5,CASTLE>Of course.

829
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,290
<31-5,CASTLE>那  能告诉我
<31-5,CASTLE>So... tell me

830
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,150
<31-5,CASTLE>去威廉斯堡干嘛了
<31-5,CASTLE>what happened in Williamsburg.

831
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,830
<31-6,ALEXIS>两天前  我们一群人去布鲁克林基娜之家
<31-6,ALEXIS>Two days ago, a bunch of us went to Keena's of Brooklyn.

832
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,980
<31-6,ALEXIS>是一家精品店
<31-6,ALEXIS>It's a boutique.

833
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,490
<31-6,ALEXIS>我朋友觉得如果我们都
<31-6,ALEXIS>And my friends thought it'd be cool

834
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,130
<31-6,ALEXIS>-顺点东西走会很酷  -你顺
<31-6,ALEXIS>- if we all took a couple of things. - You shop...

835
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,060
<31-8,CASTLE>-你偷东西了  -没有
<31-8,CASTLE>- you were shoplifting? - No.

836
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,470
<31-9,ALEXIS>我做不到  但是我朋友做了
<31-9,ALEXIS>I couldn't, but my friends did,

837
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,510
<31-9,ALEXIS>还说我胆小
<31-9,ALEXIS>and they said I was chicken.

838
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,920
<31-10,CASTLE>所以你为了在你的朋友面前扮酷
<31-10,CASTLE>So you went back to finish the job

839
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,120
<31-10,CASTLE>-又回去做了  -没有
<31-10,CASTLE>- to impress your friends. - No,

840
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,520
<31-11,ALEXIS>我去为他们偷走的东西付了钱
<31-11,ALEXIS>I went back to pay for what they stole.

841
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,740
<31-11,ALEXIS>我不能就看着有人那样被坑
<31-11,ALEXIS>I couldn't just let someone get cheated like that.

842
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,830
<31-11,ALEXIS>我从自己的小金库里拿了钱  回到店里
<31-11,ALEXIS>I took money out of my savings and went back to the store...

843
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,510
<31-12,ALEXIS>到了那  把钱和一张字条放在收银台
<31-12,ALEXIS>when I got there, I put cash on the counter with a note

844
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,190
<31-12,ALEXIS>然后以最快的速度跑掉了
<31-12,ALEXIS>and ran out as fast as I could.

845
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,530
<31-13,CASTLE>我都不知道是该生气还是该自豪
<31-13,CASTLE>I don't know whether to be angry or proud.

846
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,700
<31-13,CASTLE>-你跟哪些朋友在一起啊  -这不重要
<31-13,CASTLE>- What friends were you with? - It doesn't matter.

847
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,510
<31-15,CASTLE>当然重要了  我不想你
<31-15,CASTLE>Of course it matters. I don't

848
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,340
<31-16,ALEXIS>-跟那类人...  -我跟谁在一起你别管
<31-16,ALEXIS>- want you ha... - Who I was with is off the table.

849
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,460
<31-16,ALEXIS>我不会出卖他们的
<31-16,ALEXIS>I'm not gonna narc on them.

850
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,850
<31-16,ALEXIS>还是
<31-16,ALEXIS>Again...

851
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,790
<31-17,CASTLE>又生气又自豪
<31-17,CASTLE>angry and proud.

852
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,160
<31-17,CASTLE>只有一个问题
<31-17,CASTLE>One question, though.

853
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,050
<31-17,CASTLE>你要是什么都没拿
<31-17,CASTLE>If you didn't take anything,

854
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,930
<31-17,CASTLE>干嘛觉得有责任还钱呢
<31-17,CASTLE>why did you feel responsible?

855
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,290
<31-18,ALEXIS>他们是我的朋友啊
<31-18,ALEXIS>Because they're my friends.

856
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,850
<31-18,ALEXIS>总得有人负这个责
<31-18,ALEXIS>I guess somebody had to.

857
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,450
<31-18,ALEXIS>这么做是对的
<31-18,ALEXIS>It was the right thing to do.

858
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,570
<31-19,CASTLE>你不觉得
<31-19,CASTLE>Don't you think

859
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,470
<31-19,CASTLE>-该是他们付钱  -爸爸
<31-19,CASTLE>- they should be the ones paying... -Dad.

860
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,230
<31-21,CASTLE>你干嘛要跟这样的女孩做朋友呢
<31-21,CASTLE>Why are you even friends with these girls in the first place?

861
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,560
<31-22,ALEXIS>事情不是那么简单的
<31-22,ALEXIS>It's not that simple.

862
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,570
<31-23,CASTLE>那倒是啊
<31-23,CASTLE>No, you're right.

863
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,800
<31-23,CASTLE>从来都不简单
<31-23,CASTLE>It never is, is it?

864
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,430
<31-24,ALEXIS>-抱歉  -没关系  贝克特探长
<31-24,ALEXIS>- Oh, sorry. - Uh, no, Detective Beckett,

865
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,880
<31-24,ALEXIS>别走  我刚要回去呢
<31-24,ALEXIS>stay. I was just leaving.

866
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,290
<31-24,ALEXIS>不会有下次了  爸爸
<31-24,ALEXIS>It won't happen again, dad.

867
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,910
<31-24,ALEXIS>我保证
<31-24,ALEXIS>Promise.

868
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,480
<31-25,BECKETT>你没事吧
<31-25,BECKETT>You okay?

869
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,500
<31-26,CASTLE>有时候  无知是福啊
<31-26,CASTLE>Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.

870
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,760
<31-27,BECKETT>可不是嘛
<31-27,BECKETT>Yeah, tell me about it.

871
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,380
<31-28,CASTLE>那是鉴证组的报告吗
<31-28,CASTLE>Is that the C.S.U. report?

872
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,220
<31-29,BECKETT>座椅控制键上有两组指纹
<31-29,BECKETT>Two sets of prints on the seat controls.

873
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,340
<31-29,BECKETT>奥蒂斯的指纹在前移键上
<31-29,BECKETT>Otis' are on the seat up button.

874
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,650
<31-30,CASTLE>-后移键上呢  -自己看吧
<31-30,CASTLE>- And on the seat back? - Take a look for yourself.

875
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,050
<31-30,CASTLE>你开玩笑的吧
<31-30,CASTLE>You gotta be kidding me.

876
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,990
<32-1,BECKETT>这是我们从莱拉·埃迪森车上
<32-1,BECKETT>This is the fingerprint that we pulled

877
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,220
<32-1,BECKETT>的座椅控制键上取下来的指纹
<32-1,BECKETT>off Lyla Addison's car seat controls,

878
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,620
<32-1,BECKETT>这是我们记录在案的你的指纹
<32-1,BECKETT>and this is your fingerprint that we have on file.

879
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,000
<32-1,BECKETT>他们相匹配
<32-1,BECKETT>They are a match.

880
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,330
<32-2,EDDIE MCUSIC>-肯定出错了  -没什么错
<32-2,EDDIE MCUSIC>- There must be some mistake. - There is no mistake.

881
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,710
<32-3,BECKETT>莱拉·埃迪森被杀当晚
<32-3,BECKETT>You were in Lyla Addison's car the

882
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,460
<32-4,EDDIE MCUSIC>-你在她的车里  -我都不认识莱拉
<32-4,EDDIE MCUSIC>- night that she was killed. - I didn't even know Lyla.

883
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,630
<32-5,CASTLE>你认识
<32-5,CASTLE>Yeah, you did.

884
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,000
<32-5,CASTLE>我们把你的照片给一些人看
<32-5,CASTLE>We showed your picture around.

885
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,610
<32-5,CASTLE>你在奇异七吧做酒保
<32-5,CASTLE>You're a bartender at the Kiwi Seven Lounge.

886
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,140
<32-5,CASTLE>你的工资都是不入账的现金
<32-5,CASTLE>They pay you under the table, cash.

887
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,540
<32-6,BECKETT>而莱拉是匿名股东  你还要继续说
<32-6,BECKETT>Lyla's a silent partner. You still want to go

888
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,050
<32-6,BECKETT>你不认识她吗
<32-6,BECKETT>with the story that you don't know her?

889
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,350
<32-6,BECKETT>我觉得是你杀了她
<32-6,BECKETT>I think that you killed her,

890
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,540
<32-6,BECKETT>然后把她的尸体丢在后备箱里
<32-6,BECKETT>and then you dumped her body in her trunk.

891
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,060
<32-7,CASTLE>你却没想到自己会那么内疚
<32-7,CASTLE>What you didn't count on was the guilt.

892
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,480
<32-7,CASTLE>你得一吐为快  所以你告诉了乔
<32-7,CASTLE>You had to get it off your chest, so you told Joe,

893
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,390
<32-7,CASTLE>但你的哥哥是个可敬的人
<32-7,CASTLE>but your brother, he was an honorable man.

894
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,530
<32-8,BECKETT>他不想告发你
<32-8,BECKETT>He wasn't gonna rat you out,

895
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,260
<32-8,BECKETT>但他也不想让无辜的人终身监禁
<32-8,BECKETT>but he wasn't gonna let an innocent man go to jail for life.

896
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,030
<32-9,CASTLE>所以他打电话给地检官
<32-9,CASTLE>So he called the D.A.

897
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,170
<32-9,CASTLE>但那不管用  他就买进陪审团
<32-9,CASTLE>When that didn't work, he got on the jury.

898
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,320
<32-9,CASTLE>但是你  你发现了
<32-9,CASTLE>But you... you found out.

899
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,190
<32-9,CASTLE>你意识到
<32-9,CASTLE>And you realized...

900
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,020
<32-9,CASTLE>只要他活着你就不安全
<32-9,CASTLE>you wouldn't be safe as long as he was alive.

901
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,800
<32-10,BECKETT>你就潜进他家里
<32-10,BECKETT>And then you slipped into his apartment

902
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,720
<32-10,BECKETT>在他的药里放入了氰化物
<32-10,BECKETT>and you dosed his meds with cyanide.

903
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,070
<32-12,CASTLE>-下毒  -你真是坏的跟该隐有一拼了
<32-12,CASTLE>- Dosed his meds? - Making you the worst brother since Cain.

904
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,540
<32-13,EDDIE MCUSIC>事情不是那样的
<32-13,EDDIE MCUSIC>That isn't what happened.

905
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,980
<32-14,BECKETT>那到底怎么回事
<32-14,BECKETT>Then what happened?

906
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,970
<32-15,BECKETT>好吧
<32-15,BECKETT>Okay.

907
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,950
<32-16,EDDIE MCUSIC>等等
<32-16,EDDIE MCUSIC>Well, wait.

908
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,070
<32-16,EDDIE MCUSIC>等等
<32-16,EDDIE MCUSIC>Wait!

909
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,450
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>我是在那没错  可我没杀她
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>I was there, but I didn't kill her.

910
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,790
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>我也没杀我哥哥
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>And I didn't kill my brother.

911
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,620
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>可不管我说什么
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>But it doesn't really matter what I say,

912
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,010
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>你都不会信了
<32-17,EDDIE MCUSIC>you won't believe me anyway.

913
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,030
<32-18,BECKETT>鉴于你另外一个选择是一级谋杀的指控
<32-18,BECKETT>Well, considering your other choice is murder one,

914
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,350
<32-18,BECKETT>你还是说说看吧
<32-18,BECKETT>I would roll the dice.

915
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,650
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>史蒂芬才是凶手
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>Stephen killed Lyla.

916
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,850
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>她哥  史蒂芬·埃迪森
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>Stephen Addison... Her brother.

917
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,230
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>我们提到过乔的情况
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>And we had talked about Joe's condition.

918
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,880
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>史蒂芬定是看到乔是陪审员
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>Stephen must have seen Joe on that jury

919
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,320
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>就把他也杀了
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>and killed him, too.

920
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,880
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>史蒂芬和莱拉就是被宠坏的富二代
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>Stephen and Lyla were a pair of rich, spoiled coke fiends

921
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,930
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>想要去吸毒  就找我开车
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>who needed to make a drug run, so they had me drive.

922
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,020
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>史蒂芬在玩那把枪
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>Stephen's screwing around with this gun.

923
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,780
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>那个有信托基金的王八蛋觉得自己很牛
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>This little trust-fund gangster thinks he's so badass

924
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,830
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>后来车颠了一下  枪走火了
<32-19,EDDIE MCUSIC>till we hit a pothole, and bang!

925
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,340
<32-20,CASTLE>射中了莱拉
<32-20,CASTLE>The gun went off and hit Lyla.

926
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,480
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>她当场就死了
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>She died instantly.

927
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,670
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>我就傻了
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>I freaked.

928
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,440
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>但史蒂芬威胁说如果我告密
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>But Stephen threatened to point the finger at me

929
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>他就指认我是凶手
<32-21,EDDIE MCUSIC>if I told the truth.

930
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,930
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>我吓到了
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>I'm so scared.

931
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,330
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>我一无名小卒
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>I'm... I'm just a nobody.

932
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,030
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>他可有大律师罩着
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>He's got million-dollar lawyers!

933
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,980
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>我们把她的尸体放进了后备箱
<32-22,EDDIE MCUSIC>We put her body in the trunk.

934
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,270
<32-23,BECKETT>然后你把车弃了
<32-23,BECKETT>And you dumped the car?

935
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,930
<32-24,EDDIE MCUSIC>史蒂芬说我们把车留在贫民区
<32-24,EDDIE MCUSIC>Stephen said if we left it in the ghetto,

936
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:25,630
<32-24,EDDIE MCUSIC>你们会认为是劫车出了岔子
<32-24,EDDIE MCUSIC>the cops would think it was a carjacking gone wrong.

937
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,410
<32-25,BECKETT>然后呢
<32-25,BECKETT>And then what happened?

938
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,260
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>我们把血衣扔进了一个垃圾桶
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>We tossed our bloody clothes in a dumpster.

939
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,170
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>我去筹款会找乔
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>And... I went to see Joe at his fund-raiser.

940
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,930
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>说了发生的事
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>And I told him what happened.

941
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,480
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>他说不能就这样把莱拉留在后备箱
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>He said we couldn't leave Lyla in a trunk like that.

942
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,820
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>但乔到那的时候
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>But by the time Joe got there,

943
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,150
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>警察已经抓了那黑人
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>the cops had already pulled over that black guy,

944
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,510
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>乔就去那垃圾桶
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>so Joe went to that dumpster

945
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,180
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>拿了史蒂芬的血衣做证据
<32-26,EDDIE MCUSIC>and got Stephen's bloody clothes as insurance.

946
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,980
<32-27,CASTLE>那就是乔送到检察官办公室的东西
<32-27,CASTLE>That must be what Joe sent to the D.A.

947
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,030
<32-28,EDDIE MCUSIC>一切都是我的错
<32-28,EDDIE MCUSIC>It's all my fault.

948
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,090
<32-28,EDDIE MCUSIC>哥哥死了  是我害了他
<32-28,EDDIE MCUSIC>My brother's dead, and it's all my fault.

949
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,780
<33-1,BECKETT>那晚史蒂芬在莱拉的酒吧
<33-1,BECKETT>We can place Stephen at Lyla's bar that night.

950
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,280
<33-1,BECKETT>但除了埃迪的证词  没有别的证据
<33-1,BECKETT>But without physical evidence, all we have is Eddie's word.

951
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,890
<33-1,BECKETT>怎么办  头儿
<33-1,BECKETT>What do you think we should do, sir?

952
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,060
<33-2,MONTGOMERY>抱歉  探长
<33-2,MONTGOMERY>I'm sorry, detective.

953
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,020
<33-2,MONTGOMERY>看上去你也无能为力
<33-2,MONTGOMERY>Looks like there's nothing you can do.

954
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,740
<33-3,CASTLE>不是吧  就这样让他逍遥法外吗
<33-3,CASTLE>W-what are you saying, we just let him get away with it?

955
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,860
<33-4,MONTGOMERY>我有这么说吗
<33-4,MONTGOMERY>Did I say that?

956
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,920
<33-5,BECKETT>头儿  你去哪
<33-5,BECKETT>Uh, sir, where are you going?

957
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,500
<33-6,MONTGOMERY>找个老朋友
<33-6,MONTGOMERY>To see an old friend.

958
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,410
<33-6,MONTGOMERY>谁让你进来的
<33-6,MONTGOMERY>Hey. How'd you get in here?

959
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,880
<34-1,MONTGOMERY>用我的通行证
<34-1,MONTGOMERY>Used my key to the city.

960
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,060
<34-1,MONTGOMERY>喝一杯吗
<34-1,MONTGOMERY>You, uh, you want a drink?

961
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,140
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>我正打算开一瓶1875年的佳酿
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>I just got my hands on this brilliant bottle of 1875 St. Miriam.

962
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,990
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>我要那包衣服  路
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>I need that package, Lou.

963
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,800
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>乔·麦丘茨克给你的那个
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>The one Joe McUsic sent you.

964
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,590
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>你没处理掉
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>I know you didn't get rid of it.

965
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,220
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>那不是我认识的路易·卡耐基会做的事
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>It's not your style. Not the Louis Karnacki I know.

966
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,790
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>给你个忠告  罗伊
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>Word of advice, Roy.

967
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,910
<34-3,MONTGOMERY>别管这事了
<34-3,MONTGOMERY>Just... let this one pass you by.

968
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,550
<34-3,MONTGOMERY>你知道凶手是她哥吗
<34-3,MONTGOMERY>Did you know Lyla Addison was murdered by her brother?

969
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,870
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>做律师最重要的
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>First rule of being a lawyer

970
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,420
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>是别问你不想知道答案的问题
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>is never ask a question you don't want an answer to.

971
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,920
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>还好我不是律师
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>I guess it's good I'm not a lawyer.

972
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,280
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>这就是你们警察的毛病
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>Yeah, well, that's the problem with you cops.

973
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,870
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>你们活在黑白分明的世界里
<34-4,MONTGOMERY>You live on the corner of black and white.

974
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,550
<34-5,MONTGOMERY>但在这儿  这里是个灰色地带
<34-5,MONTGOMERY>But over here, on this side of the street, it's just gray.

975
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,070
<34-5,MONTGOMERY>你打算把罪名加给一个无辜的人
<34-5,MONTGOMERY>You just put an innocent man up for murder.

976
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,430
<34-5,MONTGOMERY>路  你这就你所谓的灰色地带吗
<34-5,MONTGOMERY>What's gray about that, lou?

977
