<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>她看起来像是被吓死的  真正被吓死的
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>She looks like she's been scared to death, literally.

32
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,270
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>这是基于你渊博的医疗经验吗  卡塞尔先生
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>Is that based on your vast medical experience, Mr. Castle?

34
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,200
<2-4,CASTLE>不  基于她看起来
<2-4,CASTLE>No, based on the fact

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,110
<2-4,CASTLE>像是爱德华·蒙克的画
<2-4,CASTLE>She looks like an Edvard Munch painting.

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,330
<2-4,CASTLE>真够吓人的

42
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,720
<2-7,CASTLE>得是个人才行
<2-7,CASTLE>If it was a who.

43
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,590
<2-8,ESPOSITO>什么意思
<2-8,ESPOSITO>Meaning?

44
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,870
<2-9,CASTLE>她说的是"它来找我了"
<2-9,CASTLE>Meaning she said "It's coming for me."

45
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,300
<2-9,CASTLE>不是他或她  而是它
<2-9,CASTLE>Not "He" or "She," but "It."

46
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,100
<2-10,CASTLE>你们瞧她都在看什么
<2-10,CASTLE>Look at what she was researching here--

47
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,600
<2-10,CASTLE>《如何辟邪》
<2-10,CASTLE>"How To Keep Away Evil,"

48
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
<2-10,CASTLE>《如何抵挡恶灵》
<2-10,CASTLE>"How To Ward Off Evil Spirits,"

49
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,210
<2-10,CASTLE>都市传说的书
<2-10,CASTLE>A book on urban legends.

50
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,560
<2-10,CASTLE>门那边  挂着马蹄
<2-10,CASTLE>Over by the door, horseshoes.

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,510
<2-10,CASTLE>还有两个印第安风铃
<2-10,CASTLE>I've clocked two indian wind chimes,

52
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,960
<2-10,CASTLE>这里和那里
<2-10,CASTLE>There and there.

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,320
<2-10,CASTLE>这些是用来抵挡恶灵的
<2-10,CASTLE>These are things used to ward off evil spirits,

54
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,660
<2-10,CASTLE>比如说帕穆特医生
<2-10,CASTLE>like Perlmutter.

55
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,720
<2-11,PERLMUTTER>我听到了
<2-11,PERLMUTTER>I heard that.

56
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,110
<2-12,ESPOSITO>你什么意思  卡塞尔
<2-12,ESPOSITO>What are you saying, Castle?

57
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,600
<2-12,ESPOSITO>是恶灵要了她的命吗
<2-12,ESPOSITO>Oh, was the boogeyman out to get her?

58
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,470
<2-13,CASTLE>我是说也许这是她的想法
<2-13,CASTLE>I'm saying maybe that's what she thought--

59
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,760
<2-13,CASTLE>所以才会说  "它来找我了"
<2-13,CASTLE>Why she said "It's coming for me,"

60
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,430
<2-13,CASTLE>所以灯灭了
<2-13,CASTLE>why the lights went out,

61
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,290
<2-13,CASTLE>她又死得这么离奇
<2-13,CASTLE>why she inexplicably died,

62
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,000
<2-13,CASTLE>而且看起来很害怕
<2-13,CASTLE>and why she looks so scared.

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,260
<2-14,BECKETT>她害怕是因为她要被杀害了
<2-14,BECKETT>She was scared because she was about to be killed

64
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,750
<2-14,BECKETT>凶手是个人
<2-14,BECKETT>by an actual person.

65
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,510
<2-14,BECKETT>所以我们该努力找出这个人
<2-14,BECKETT>So we should spend our time looking for that person.

66
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,550
<2-14,BECKETT>大家开始排查  在楼内逐一问话
<2-14,BECKETT>Let's set up a canvass and talk to everyone in the building

67
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,890
<2-14,BECKETT>看有谁听到或看到什么
<2-14,BECKETT>that might have seen or heard something.

68
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,260
<2-15,AMANDA>瓦尔出什么事了
<2-15,AMANDA>Wh-what happened to Val?

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,010
<2-15,AMANDA>到底怎么回事
<2-15,AMANDA>What's going on?

70
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,100
<3-1,AMANDA>我晚上在大学做研究助理
<3-1,AMANDA>I work nights as a research assistant at the college.

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,100
<3-1,AMANDA>我昨晚应该留在家里的
<3-1,AMANDA>But I should've stayed home last night.

72
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,260
<3-1,AMANDA>我知道她碰到麻烦了
<3-1,AMANDA>I knew something was up with her.

73
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,330
<3-2,BECKETT>什么意思
<3-2,BECKETT>What do you mean?

74
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,380
<3-3,AMANDA>过去几天她非常奇怪
<3-3,AMANDA>She's been weird the past couple of days.

75
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,020
<3-3,AMANDA>不吃不睡
<3-3,AMANDA>She hadn't been eating or sleeping.

76
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,530
<3-3,AMANDA>总是疑神疑鬼的  总是锁上门
<3-3,AMANDA>She was really paranoid, always locking the doors.

77
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,970
<3-4,CASTLE>她说了是什么问题吗
<3-4,CASTLE>Did she say what was wrong?

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,640
<3-5,AMANDA>我问了
<3-5,AMANDA>I asked,

79
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,100
<3-5,AMANDA>但她说她不想谈
<3-5,AMANDA>but she said she didn't want to talk about it.

80
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,520
<3-6,BECKETT>阿曼达  你知不知道
<3-6,BECKETT>Amanda, do you know of anyone

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,890
<3-6,BECKETT>是否有人想伤害她
<3-6,BECKETT>that would've wanted to hurt her?

82
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,540
<3-7,AMANDA>她的前男友
<3-7,AMANDA>Her ex-boyfriend.

83
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,340
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>前男友叫弗雷迪·贝克
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>Boyfriend's name is Freddie Baker,

84

<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>31岁
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>31.

85
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,430
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>案底相当精彩  拒捕
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>Quite the resume-- resisting arrest,

00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,550
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>人身攻击
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>assault and battery.

87
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,560
<4-2,CASTLE>听起来像是白马王子
<4-2,CASTLE>Sounds like a prince.

88
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,810
<4-3,RYAN>不过瓦尔变聪明了
<4-3,RYAN>Yeah, Val wised up, though.

89
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,300
<4-3,RYAN>分手后  她申请了法院限制令
<4-3,RYAN>She filed a restraining order against him after they broke up.

90
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,780
<4-3,RYAN>埃斯波西托在查他昨晚在哪里
<4-3,RYAN>Esposito is checking into where he was last night.

91
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,600
<4-4,BECKETT>瓦尔的家人和朋友那边有什么消息
<4-4,BECKETT>So what did we get from Val's family and friends?

92
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,090
<4-5,RYAN>他们过去三天都没联络上她
<4-5,RYAN>Just that they hadn't heard from her in the last three days.

93
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,270
<4-5,RYAN>她不回任何信息
<4-5,RYAN>She wasn't returning their messages.

94
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,930
<4-6,CASTLE>三天  瓦尔的室友说她
<4-6,CASTLE>Three days--that's how long Val's roommate

95
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,990
<4-6,CASTLE>正是三天前开始变奇怪的
<4-6,CASTLE>said she'd been acting strangely.

96
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,860
<4-7,RYAN>我调查了她人生的最后72小时
<4-7,RYAN>Yeah, so I dug into the last 72 hours of her life.

97
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,000
<4-7,RYAN>除了用信用卡支付
<4-7,RYAN>Besides a credit card charge

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,460
<4-7,RYAN>去格林威治的火车票
<4-7,RYAN>for a train ticket to Greenwich,

99
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,610
<4-7,RYAN>没其它不寻常的
<4-7,RYAN>there was nothing else unusual.

100
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,820
<4-8,BECKETT>她去格林威治做什么
<4-8,BECKETT>What was she doing in Greenwich?

101
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,910
<4-9,RYAN>这我还在查
<4-9,RYAN>I'm still looking into that,

102
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,260
<4-9,RYAN>但过去几天的反常情况
<4-9,RYAN>but as far as abnormalities for the last few days,

103
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,960
<4-9,RYAN>就这些了
<4-9,RYAN>that was it.

<4-10,CASTLE>马蹄  都市传说的书
<4-10,CASTLE>the horse shoe, the book on urban legends--

00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,440
<4-10,CASTLE>都是两天前网上购买的
<4-10,CASTLE>All bought online two days ago.

107
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,150
<4-10,CASTLE>仿佛是瓦尔认为
<4-10,CASTLE>Almost as if Val thought

108
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,110
<4-10,CASTLE>某种恶灵找上她了
<4-10,CASTLE>some kind of evil spirit was coming for her.

109
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,470
<4-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她觉得会发生的
<4-11,BECKETT>Castle, what she thought was gonna happen

110
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,510
<4-11,BECKETT>与事实发生的
<4-11,BECKETT>versus what actually happened

111
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,960
<4-11,BECKETT>完全是两码事
<4-11,BECKETT>are two completely different things.

112
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,940
<4-12,ESPOSITO>对  如果说瓦尔有什么麻烦
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, because if Val was a victim of anything,

113
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,560
<4-12,ESPOSITO>就是她挑男人的眼光太差
<4-12,ESPOSITO>it's her lousy taste in men.

114
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
<4-12,ESPOSITO>排查有结果
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Canvass popped.

115
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,420
<4-12,ESPOSITO>有个邻居见到弗雷迪在她死前一小时
<4-12,ESPOSITO>One of her neighbors saw Freddie in the building

116
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,730
<4-12,ESPOSITO>出现在公寓大楼
<4-12,ESPOSITO>an hour before her death.

117
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,610
<5-1,FREDDIE BAKER>我绝不会伤害瓦尔的
<5-1,FREDDIE BAKER>I would never hurt Val.

<5-1,FREDDIE BAKER>我爱她
<5-1,FREDDIE BAKER>I loved her.

119
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,710
<5-2,BECKETT>真的吗  那你如何解释她申请的针对你的
<5-2,BECKETT>Really? Then how do you explain this restraining order

120
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,320
<5-2,BECKETT>法院限制令
<5-2,BECKETT>that she filed against you?

121
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,690
<5-2,BECKETT>这是情书吗
<5-2,BECKETT>Was that a love letter?

122
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,110
<5-3,FREDDIE>这是误会
<5-3,FREDDIE>A misunderstanding.

123

<5-4,ESPOSITO>我们有目击证人看到你
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Well, we got a witness that saw you

<5-4,ESPOSITO>in Val's apartment last night, Freddie.

125
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,200
<5-5,FREDDIE>但我没有杀她
<5-5,FREDDIE>But I didn't kill her.

126
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,430
<5-5,FREDDIE>没错  我去了
<5-5,FREDDIE>Yes, I went over there,

127
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,560
<5-5,FREDDIE>但那是因为她求我去的
<5-5,FREDDIE>but only because she begged me to.

128
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,060
<5-6,BECKETT>你觉得我们会相信
<5-6,BECKETT>Do you actually expect us to believe

129
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
<5-6,BECKETT>她在申请法院限制令后
<5-6,BECKETT>that she invited you over to her apartment

130
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,990
<5-6,BECKETT>还会邀请你过去吗
<5-6,BECKETT>after she filed a restraining order?

131
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,280
<5-7,FREDDIE>真的  她说她想复合
<5-7,FREDDIE>It's true. She said she wanted to get back together.

132
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,350
<5-7,FREDDIE>但我去了后  她只是
<5-7,FREDDIE>But when I got there, all she did was

133
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,680
<5-7,FREDDIE>指责我给她寄了什么包裹
<5-7,FREDDIE>accuse me of sending her some package.

134
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,240
<5-8,ESPOSITO>什么包裹
<5-8,ESPOSITO>What package?

135
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,560
<5-9,FREDDIE>我也不知道
<5-9,FREDDIE>I have no idea.

136
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,710
<5-9,FREDDIE>但当我说我什么都没寄过时
<5-9,FREDDIE>But when I told her I didn't send her anything,

137
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,170
<5-9,FREDDIE>她就开始慌了
<5-9,FREDDIE>she started freaking out.

138
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,260
<5-10,BECKETT>什么意思
<5-10,BECKETT>How was she freaking out?

139
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,900
<5-11,FREDDIE>她不停念叨  "这是真的"
<5-11,FREDDIE>She kept saying, "It's real".

140
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,890
<5-12,ESPOSITO>什么是真的
<5-12,ESPOSITO>What's real?

141
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,050
<5-12,ESPOSITO>不知道
<5-12,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

142
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,560
<5-13,FREDDIE>她的话  完全语无伦次
<5-13,FREDDIE>She wasn't making... any sense.

143
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,000
<5-13,FREDDIE>她不断问我
<5-13,FREDDIE>She kept asking me

144
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,170
<5-13,FREDDIE>是否相信恶魔的力量
<5-13,FREDDIE>if I believed in the power of evil.

145
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,350
<5-14,FREDDIE>我不想因为违反限制令惹祸上身
<5-14,FREDDIE>I didn't want to get in trouble for breaking the R.O.,

146
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,530
<5-14,FREDDIE>就离开她家  跟朋友出去了
<5-14,FREDDIE>so I got out of there, went to hang out with friends.

147
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,930
<5-14,FREDDIE>但我离开她家的时候
<5-14,FREDDIE>But when I left that apartment,

148
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,960
<5-14,FREDDIE>瓦尔绝对还活着
<5-14,FREDDIE>Val was alive.

149
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,420
<5-14,FREDDIE>我发誓
<5-14,FREDDIE>I swear.

150
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,090
<6-1,ESPOSITO>弗雷迪的不在场证明核实了
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Freddie's alibi checks out.

151
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,510
<6-1,ESPOSITO>他的朋友证实他11点与他们碰面
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Friends confirm that he met them at 11:00.

152
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,080
<6-1,ESPOSITO>他们在一家夜店玩到天亮
<6-1,ESPOSITO>They hung out at a club till dawn.

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,640
<6-2,BECKETT>那么他不是凶手了
<6-2,BECKETT>So he's not our guy.

154
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,260
<6-3,CASTLE>我只想提醒你们  瓦尔问他
<6-3,CASTLE>Well, I'll just point out that Val asked him

155
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,750
<6-3,CASTLE>是否相信恶魔的力量
<6-3,CASTLE>if he believed in the power of evil

156
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,970
<6-3,CASTLE>还不断说什么是真的
<6-3,CASTLE>and then was talking about how it was "real".

157
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,590
<6-3,CASTLE>-我不愿这么说...  -那就别说
<6-3,CASTLE>- I hate to say it-- - Then don't.

158
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,900
<6-4,BECKETT>鉴证组在她公寓里发现包裹了吗
<6-4,BECKETT>Did C.S.U. find a package at her apartment?

159
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,620
<6-5,ESPOSITO>没  但他们光顾着找凶案证物没查邮件
<6-5,ESPOSITO>No, but they were looking for evidence of the murder not mail.

160
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,500
<6-6,BECKETT>也许那才是让她惊慌的东西
<6-6,BECKETT>So maybe that's what freaked Val out.

161
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,680
<6-6,BECKETT>她知道寄包裹的人想要杀她
<6-6,BECKETT>She knew that that package was coming from her killer.

162
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,970
<7-1,BECKETT>有什么发现吗
<7-1,BECKETT>Did you find anything yet?

163
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,150
<7-2,CASTLE>有  柜子里的细高跟鞋比你的还多
<7-2,CASTLE>Yes, a closet with more stilettos than yours.

164
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,410
<7-2,CASTLE>我以为你的鞋量已无人能及了
<7-2,CASTLE>Didn't think it was possible.

165
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,380
<7-2,CASTLE>你呢  有发现吗
<7-2,CASTLE>How about you? Any luck?

166
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,660
<7-3,BECKETT>有  似乎她收到的包裹
<7-3,BECKETT>Uh, yes. Looks like the package she got

167
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,130
<7-3,BECKETT>里面有一张CD或DVD
<7-3,BECKETT>contained a CD or a DVD

168
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,180
<7-3,BECKETT>所以留心找找光碟
<7-3,BECKETT>so be on the lookout for a disc.

169
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,500
<7-4,CASTLE>光碟  明白了
<7-4,CASTLE>Disc, got ya.

170
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,750
<7-5,VIDEO>救我
<7-5,VIDEO>Help me.

171
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,940
<7-6,CASTLE>贝克特
<7-6,CASTLE>Uh, Beckett?

172
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,680
<7-6,CASTLE>贝克特
<7-6,CASTLE>Beckett?

173
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,420
<7-7,CASTLE>你能过来一下吗
<7-7,CASTLE>Can you come here?

174
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,300
<9-7,BECKETT>你看过了
<9-7,BECKETT>You saw!

175
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,010
<9-8,CASTLE>第三天的午夜
<9-8,CASTLE>Midnight on the third day...

176
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,310
<9-9,VIDEO>就是你的死期
<9-9,VIDEO>you die!

177
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,950
<7-9,BECKETT>你还好吧  你找到什么了吗
<7-9,BECKETT>Are you okay? Did you find something?

178
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,940
<7-10,CASTLE>你说瓦尔是哪天收到包裹的
<7-10,CASTLE>When did you say Val got that package?

179
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,360
<7-11,BECKETT>遇害前三天
<7-11,BECKETT>Three days before she died.

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,860
<7-11,BECKETT>正是第三天的午夜
<7-11,BECKETT>That was midnight on the third day.

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,340
<7-12,CASTLE>她是因为看这光碟而死
<7-12,CASTLE>She died because she saw this disc.

182
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,170
<7-12,CASTLE>现在我也看了
<7-12,CASTLE>And now I saw it,

183
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,830
<7-12,CASTLE>下一个就是我了
<7-12,CASTLE>which means I'm next.

193
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,890
<8-1,CASTLE>据传有一段神秘的录像
<8-1,CASTLE>"Legend tells of a mysterious video

194
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,010
<8-1,CASTLE>能够控制冥界恶魔的力量
<8-1,CASTLE>"that can harness the forces of evil from the beyond.

195
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,900
<8-1,CASTLE>这张碟预示着巨大的不幸
<8-1,CASTLE>"The disc is a harbinger of great misfortune,

196
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,200
<8-1,CASTLE>标记它的观看者
<8-1,CASTLE>"marking its watchers

197
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,640
<8-1,CASTLE>并让他们无法逃脱死亡的下场
<8-1,CASTLE>and sentencing them to certain and unavoidable death."

198
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,870
<8-1,CASTLE>我跟瓦尔一样看到了光碟
<8-1,CASTLE>I saw it, just like Val did.

199
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,470
<8-1,CASTLE>所以她才会说  "它来找我了"
<8-1,CASTLE>That's why she said "It's coming for me".

200
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,100
<8-1,CASTLE>所以她知道自己何时会死
<8-1,CASTLE>That's how she knew when she was gonna die,

201
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,600
<8-1,CASTLE>并竭尽全力阻挡恶灵
<8-1,CASTLE>why she was trying to ward off spirits--

202
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,940
<8-1,CASTLE>都是因为看到了光碟上的讯息
<8-1,CASTLE>because of the message on that disc.

203
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,250
<8-2,ESPOSITO>一张DVD要怎么杀人
<8-2,ESPOSITO>How's a DVD gonna kill you?

204
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,680
<8-2,ESPOSITO>它会像忍者镖那样  砍下你的脑袋吗
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Is it gonna come at you like a ninja star, cut your head off?

205
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,890
<8-3,CASTLE>碟片本身不会置你于死地  埃斯波西托
<8-3,CASTLE>The actual DVD will not kill me, Esposito.

206
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,560
<8-3,CASTLE>是里面的灵魂
<8-3,CASTLE>It will be the spirit inside the DVD,

207
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
<8-3,CASTLE>就像《午夜凶铃》里那样
<8-3,CASTLE>just like in "The Ring".

208
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,540
<8-4,RYAN>就是  是那个...
<8-4,RYAN>Ooh, ooh, the one...

209
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,900
<8-4,RYAN>全身湿透了的诡异的小女孩
<8-4,RYAN>with the creepy waterlogged little girl

210
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,890
<8-4,RYAN>从电视机里爬出来的那部
<8-4,RYAN>who crawls out of the TV.

211
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,440
<8-4,RYAN>看过那片子后我好些天没睡
<8-4,RYAN>I didn't sleep for days after that movie.

212
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,210
<8-5,BECKETT>没错  谢谢  那电影
<8-5,BECKETT>Yes, exactly. Thank you. That movie.

213
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,210
<8-5,BECKETT>是编出来的
<8-5,BECKETT>It's fiction.

214
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,450
<8-5,BECKETT>是讲都市传说的书上的一个恐怖故事
<8-5,BECKETT>It's a horror story in a book about urban legends.

215
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,880
<8-6,RYAN>对  我是说  因为
<8-6,RYAN>Yeah, I mean, because...

216
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,270
<8-6,RYAN>仅此而已  对不对
<8-6,RYAN>that's all it is, right?

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,630
<8-15,CASTLE>只是个传说
<8-15,CASTLE>A legend.

218
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,920
<8-6,RYAN>很多传说都来源于现实
<8-6,RYAN>Many legends are based in truth.

219
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,150
<8-7,CASTLE>我看了录像
<8-7,CASTLE>I saw the video.

220
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,790
<8-7,CASTLE>三天后的午夜  我就会死
<8-7,CASTLE>At midnight in three days time, I will die.

221
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,090
<8-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那讯息不是留给你的
<8-8,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, that message wasn't for you.

222
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,930
<8-8,BECKETT>是给瓦尔的恐吓  并非来自灵魂
<8-8,BECKETT>It was a threat for Val. And it wasn't made by spirits.

223
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,670
<8-8,BECKETT>而是来自杀害她的凶手
<8-8,BECKETT>It was made by her murderer.

224
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,110
<8-8,BECKETT>那么追踪到寄光碟的人
<8-8,BECKETT>So tracing the disc to whoever sent it

225
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,530
<8-8,BECKETT>就能找到凶手了
<8-8,BECKETT>should lead us straight to him.

226
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,530
<8-9,ESPOSITO>-埃斯波  -是
<8-9,ESPOSITO>- Espo. - Yeah.

227
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,660
<8-10,BECKETT>这个空运单上有个信箱  你能查查吗
<8-10,BECKETT>There's a P.O. box on this airbill. Could you look into it?

228
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,050
<8-12,BECKETT>-行  -还有  莱恩
<8-12,BECKETT>- Yeah. - And, Ryan, why don't you

229
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,160
<8-12,BECKETT>你也来看看这光碟  看...
<8-12,BECKETT>take a look at this disc and see--

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,810
<8-13,RYAN>抱歉  什么
<8-13,RYAN>Oh, I'm--I'm sorry, what?

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,990
<8-14,ESPOSITO>你也这样  兄弟
<8-14,ESPOSITO>Et tu, bro?

232
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,590
<8-15,CASTLE>你不是说这个故事就是个传说吗
<8-15,CASTLE>What did you say about the story being a legend?

233
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,150
<8-16,RYAN>没错  但
<8-16,RYAN>Um, well, uh,

234
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,290
<8-16,RYAN>珍妮和我
<8-16,RYAN>Jenny and I,

235
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,040

<8-16,RYAN>we are trying to make a baby,

236
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,530
<8-16,RYAN>所以书上写的所有迷信我们都得信
<8-16,RYAN>so we're abiding by every superstition in the book.

237
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,730
<8-17,BECKETT>好吧  那你来  埃斯波
<8-17,BECKETT>Okay. Fine. Here, Espo.

240
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,820
<8-18,ESPOSITO>要是我看了这个  就显得我的搭档
<8-18,ESPOSITO>If I watch that, it's gonna make my partner out

241
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,230
<8-18,ESPOSITO>是胆小鬼
<8-18,ESPOSITO>to be a wimp,

242
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,340
<8-19,ESPOSITO>我不能这样
<8-19,ESPOSITO>and I can't have that.

243
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,700
<8-20,RYAN>-多谢  兄弟  -没事
<8-20,RYAN>- Thanks, bro. - Yeah.

244
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,210
<8-21,ESPOSITO>我真为你俩悲哀
<8-21,ESPOSITO>This is so pathetic.

245
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,760
<8-22,BECKETT>好吧  我看就是了
<8-22,BECKETT>Fine. I will watch it.

<8-23,CASTLE>Wait. No. What are you doing?

<8-24,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我在做我的本职工作
<8-24,BECKETT>Castle, I'm doing my job.

248
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,900
<8-24,BECKETT>这里总得有人干吧
<8-24,BECKETT>Someone here has to.

249
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,050
<8-25,CASTLE>想想可能的后果
<8-25,CASTLE>Okay, think of the risks.

250
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,620
<8-25,CASTLE>你也许不信这些
<8-25,CASTLE>You may not think there's anything to this,

251
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,710
<8-25,CASTLE>但万一你错了呢
<8-25,CASTLE>but what if you're wrong?

252
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,160
<8-26,BECKETT>我很感谢你的关心
<8-26,BECKETT>You know, I appreciate your concern,

253
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,700
<8-26,BECKETT>但这不过是张光碟罢了
<8-26,BECKETT>but it's just a DVD.

254
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,690
<8-27,CASTLE>不  你不能就这么播
<8-27,CASTLE>You--you don't-- you can't just play it.

255
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,850
<8-27,CASTLE>让我做点预防措施
<8-27,CASTLE>Let me take precautions here.

256
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,820
<8-27,CASTLE>不能让整个分局的人都跟我一起遭殃
<8-27,CASTLE>Don't want the whole precinct suffering my fate.

257
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,810
<9-1,CASTLE>好吧  好吧
<9-1,CASTLE>Okay. Okay.

258
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,470
<9-1,CASTLE>你想握着我的手吗
<9-1,CASTLE>You want to hold my hand?

259
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,680
<9-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我一点不害怕
<9-2,BECKETT>Castle, I'm not scared.

260
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,540
<9-3,CASTLE>可是我害怕呀
<9-3,CASTLE>Well, I wasn't asking for you.

261
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,530
<9-5,BECKETT>准备好了吗
<9-5,BECKETT>Are you ready?

262
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,730
<9-6,CASTLE>有差别吗
<9-6,CASTLE>Does it matter?

263
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,250
<9-6,CASTLE>救我
<9-6,CASTLE>Help me.

264
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,000
<9-7,BECKETT>那是什么声音
<9-7,BECKETT>What are those sounds?

265
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,340
<9-7,BECKETT>我说吧  后面的更糟
<9-7,BECKETT>Right? It gets worse.

266
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,210
<9-8,CASTLE>马上就到了
<9-8,CASTLE>Wait for it.

267
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,750
<9-9,VIDEO>你看过了
<9-9,VIDEO>You saw!

268
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,540
<9-9,VIDEO>三天后的午夜
<9-9,VIDEO>Midnight on the third day...

269
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,940
<9-9,VIDEO>就是你的死期
<9-9,VIDEO>You die!

270
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,570
<9-10,BECKETT>没错  是有点恐怖
<9-10,BECKETT>You're right. It is kinda creepy.

271
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,360
<9-11,CASTLE>谢谢
<9-11,CASTLE>Thank you.

272
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,790
<9-12,BECKETT>因为凶手故意做的很恐怖  卡塞尔
<9-12,BECKETT>Because the killer made it creepy, Castle.

273
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,150
<9-12,BECKETT>也许死者曾见过这些画面
<9-12,BECKETT>Maybe these images meant something to the victim,

274
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,240
<9-12,BECKETT>或许能查出她和凶手的关系
<9-12,BECKETT>clues to the relationship between her and the killer.

275
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,210
<9-12,BECKETT>等等
<9-12,BECKETT>Wait.

276
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,950
<9-13,CASTLE>倒回去
<9-13,CASTLE>Go back.

277
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,580
<9-13,CASTLE>那个  那个  那是...
<9-13,CASTLE>That one--that one there. That's the, um...

278
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,930
<9-13,CASTLE>那是西藏轮  象征着重生
<9-13,CASTLE>That's the tibetan wheel. Symbolizes rebirth.

279
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,260
<9-13,CASTLE>等下
<9-13,CASTLE>Hang on.

280
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,770
<9-14,CASTLE>那是个共济会罗盘  那是...
<9-14,CASTLE>That is the masonic compass. That's...

281
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,050
<9-14,CASTLE>那代表了复活
<9-14,CASTLE>They felt it represented, uh, resurrection.

282
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,430
<9-15,BECKETT>你想说什么
<9-15,BECKETT>Your point being?

283
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,670
<9-16,CASTLE>重生  复活
<9-16,CASTLE>Rebirth? Resurrection?

284
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,390
<9-16,CASTLE>这段录像显然复活了某个死去的东西
<9-16,CASTLE>This video obviously resurrects something from the great beyond,

285
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,250
<9-16,CASTLE>危险的东西
<9-16,CASTLE>something dangerous,

286
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,350
<9-16,CASTLE>会杀人的东西
<9-16,CASTLE>something... murderous.

287
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,940
<9-16,CASTLE>还能有什么别的解释呢
<9-16,CASTLE>I mean, what other explanation can there be?

288
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,590
<9-17,BECKETT>有很多解释  卡塞尔
<9-17,BECKETT>There are plenty of explanations, Castle,

289
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,470
<9-17,BECKETT>而且都与超自然现象无关
<9-17,BECKETT>and none of them are supernatural.

290
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,610
<9-17,BECKETT>实际上  我敢说帕穆特已经查明死因了
<9-17,BECKETT>In fact, I bet Perlmutter has our cause of death by now.

291
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,150
<9-17,BECKETT>毒检尸检报告都应该出来了
<9-17,BECKETT>Those tox and autopsy reports should be done.

292
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,460
<10-1,PERLMUTTER>贝克特探长
<10-1,PERLMUTTER>Ah, Detective Beckett

293
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,750
<10-1,PERLMUTTER>还有讨厌鬼卡塞尔
<10-1,PERLMUTTER>and defective Castle.

294
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,210
<10-2,BECKETT>帕穆特  瓦尔·巴特勒是怎么死的
<10-2,BECKETT>So, Perlmutter, how was Val Butler killed?

295
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,140
<10-3,PERLMUTTER>死于心力衰竭
<10-3,PERLMUTTER>It appears she died of heart failure.

296
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,320
<10-4,CASTLE>27岁吗
<10-4,CASTLE>At 27?

297
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,910
<10-5,BECKETT>她有心脏疾病吗
<10-5,BECKETT>Did she have heart problems?

298
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,150
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>心脏停跳绝对是个毛病
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>Well, she certainly did once it stopped beating.

299
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,320
<10-7,BECKETT>为什么会停跳
<10-7,BECKETT>What made it stop?

300
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,700
<10-7,BECKETT>有没有可能是中毒
<10-7,BECKETT>Is it possible that she was poisoned

301
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,500
<10-7,BECKETT>或是吸毒过量
<10-7,BECKETT>or O.D.'ed on drugs?

302
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,130
<10-8,PERLMUTTER>血检没有异常
<10-8,PERLMUTTER>Nothing showed up on her blood panels.

303
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,830
<10-9,CASTLE>那是什么导致她...
<10-9,CASTLE>What about what caused her, um...

304
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,600
<10-10,PERLMUTTER>死后面部肌肉收缩
<10-10,PERLMUTTER>Well, postmortem contractions of the facial muscles

305
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,100
<10-10,PERLMUTTER>也并不是前所未闻
<10-10,PERLMUTTER>are not unheard of.

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,470
<10-11,CASTLE>你不知道死因是什么
<10-11,CASTLE>You don't know what killed her.

307
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,030
<10-13,CASTLE>-不能这么说  -你有想法了吗
<10-13,CASTLE>- I wouldn't say that. - Do you have a theory?

308
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,160
<10-14,PERLMUTTER>现在还没
<10-14,PERLMUTTER>Not at the present time.

309
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,310
<10-15,CASTLE>那就是说你不知道
<10-15,CASTLE>That means you don't know.

310
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,650
<10-15,CASTLE>唯一的解释
<10-15,CASTLE>And the only explanation

311
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,440
<10-15,CASTLE>就是瓦尔看到了极其吓人的东西
<10-15,CASTLE>is that Val faced something so scary,

312
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,250
<10-15,CASTLE>于是心脏停跳
<10-15,CASTLE>it stopped her heart

313
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,530
<10-15,CASTLE>脸也僵在最后的表情上  就是惊恐
<10-15,CASTLE>and froze her face in the last expression she had, terror.

314
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,620
<10-15,CASTLE>承认吧
<10-15,CASTLE>Admit it.

315
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,090
<10-16,PERLMUTTER>卡塞尔先生  我只能说  到目前为止
<10-16,PERLMUTTER>All I'll say, Mr. Castle, is that for now,

316
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,590
<10-16,PERLMUTTER>死因未知
<10-16,PERLMUTTER>cause of death is unknown.

317
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,720
<10-17,CASTLE>未知
<10-17,CASTLE>Unknown?

318
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,280
<10-17,CASTLE>听见了吗
<10-17,CASTLE>Hear that?

319
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,270
<10-17,CASTLE>不妙啊
<10-17,CASTLE>Not good.

320
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,560
<10-18,BECKETT>你在干什么
<10-18,BECKETT>What are you doing?

321
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,800
<10-19,CASTLE>看我的遗愿清单
<10-19,CASTLE>Checking my bucket list

322
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,290
<10-19,CASTLE>看两天内我能实现几条
<10-19,CASTLE>to see how many things I can get done in two days.

324
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,900
<10-19,CASTLE>你们有谁能把我介绍给比尔·夏特纳吗
<10-19,CASTLE>Can either one of you introduce me to Bill Shatner?

325
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,840
<11-1,RYAN>查明是谁寄了这张光盘
<11-1,RYAN>You know, finding who sent this disc

326
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,570
<11-1,RYAN>应该能让卡塞尔好受一点
<11-1,RYAN>should make Castle feel a whole lot better.

327
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,780
<11-2,ESPOSITO>是啊  但如果真被卡塞尔说中
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but what if the worst happens

328
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,990
<11-2,ESPOSITO>发生了最糟的情况呢
<11-2,ESPOSITO>and--and Castle's right?

329
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,900
<11-2,ESPOSITO>你觉得他会在遗嘱里提到我吗
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Do you think he put me in his will?

330
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,750
<11-3,RYAN>老兄  一点都不好玩
<11-3,RYAN>Dude, uncool.

331
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,580
<11-3,RYAN>怎么了
<11-3,RYAN>What?

332
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,240
<11-4,ESPOSITO>我就是好奇
<11-4,ESPOSITO>I'm just wondering.

333
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,580
<11-4,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔要是死了是挺难过的
<11-4,ESPOSITO>I mean, Castle's death would be sad and all,

334
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,510
<11-4,ESPOSITO>但他的法拉利绝对能减轻我的悲痛
<11-4,ESPOSITO>but his Ferrari sure would lessen my grief.

335
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,010
<11-5,RYAN>你知道光说这种话也会遭报应吧
<11-5,RYAN>You do realize that even putting that out in the universe is bad karma?

336
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,170
<11-5,RYAN>拜托  卡塞尔不会死的
<11-5,RYAN>Please. Castle's not gonna die.

337
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,800
<11-6,ESPOSITO>我们要抓的也不是恶灵
<11-6,ESPOSITO>We're not dealing with an evil spirit.

338
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,880
<11-6,ESPOSITO>我们要抓的是有寄件人地址的人
<11-6,ESPOSITO>We're dealing with a guy who has a return address.

340
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,780
<12-1,TOMMY>为什么大家都来问1135号邮箱呢
<12-1,TOMMY>Why does everybody keep asking about box 1135?

341
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,350
<12-2,RYAN>等下  还有谁问了
<12-2,RYAN>Wait. Who else has been asking about it?

342
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,990
<12-3,TOMMY>有个褐发的女人几天前来过
<12-3,TOMMY>Some brunette chick came in here a couple days ago.

343
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,240
<12-4,ESPOSITO>大概是瓦尔
<12-4,ESPOSITO>Probably Val.

344
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,440
<12-4,ESPOSITO>你怎么跟她说的
<12-4,ESPOSITO>What did you tell her?

345
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,630
<12-5,TOMMY>什么都没说
<12-5,TOMMY>Nothing, bruh.

346
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,120
<12-5,TOMMY>有违公司规定
<12-5,TOMMY>It's against company policy.

347
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,080
<12-6,RYAN>我觉得这个胜过公司规定
<12-6,RYAN>Well, I think that this trumps company policy.

348
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,630
<12-6,RYAN>邮箱是谁的
<12-6,RYAN>So who owns the box?

349
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,550
<12-7,TOMMY>这就是奇怪的地方了
<12-7,TOMMY>Ah, that's the weird thing.

350
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,270
<12-7,TOMMY>邮箱的主人大概在三个月前死了
<12-7,TOMMY>The guy who owns it died, like, three months ago.

351
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,930
<12-7,TOMMY>所以他不可能寄包裹
<12-7,TOMMY>So he couldn't have sent that package

352
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,810
<12-7,TOMMY>除非他是从冥府寄的
<12-7,TOMMY>unless he sent it from the great beyond.

353
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,930
<13-1,RYAN>邮箱最后的租客是安德鲁·莱维
<13-1,RYAN>The box was last rented by an Andrew Levine,

354
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,820
<13-1,RYAN>他三个月前死于肝功能衰竭
<13-1,RYAN>who died of liver failure three months ago.

355
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,490
<13-1,RYAN>不过我觉得他和案件无关
<13-1,RYAN>Somehow I don't think he's connected to this case.

356
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,630
<13-2,BECKETT>那么凶手掩盖了踪迹
<13-2,BECKETT>So the killer covered his tracks.

357
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,570
<13-2,BECKETT>他一定是在寄件单上随便写了一个邮箱号
<13-2,BECKETT>He must have written a random P.O. box on the packaging slip.

358
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,900
<13-4,BECKETT>-或者  -不  莱恩  没有或者
<13-4,BECKETT>- Or-- - No. Ryan, there is no "Or."

359
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,620
<13-5,RYAN>我只是说  也许我们追查不到
<13-5,RYAN>I'm just saying, maybe the reason

360
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,020
<13-5,RYAN>包裹源头的原因
<13-5,RYAN>we can't trace this package's origin

361
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,790
<13-5,RYAN>是因为它是从另一个世界寄来的
<13-5,RYAN>is because it was sent from another realm.

362
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,870
<13-5,RYAN>莱恩说得对  是从另一个世界寄来的
<13-5,RYAN>Ryan's right. It was sent from another realm.

363
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,380
<13-5,RYAN>新泽西
<13-5,RYAN>New Jersey.

364
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,830
<13-6,ESPOSITO>我查了瓦尔包裹的空运单号
<13-6,ESPOSITO>I looked into the airbill number on Val's package.

365
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,780
<13-6,ESPOSITO>发现是同一个人寄出的
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Turns out it's one in a sequence of airbills

366
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,900
<13-6,ESPOSITO>几张空运单中的一个
<13-6,ESPOSITO>all sent from the same guy--

367
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,260
<13-6,ESPOSITO>寄件人杰森·本内特
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Jason Bennett.

368
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,670
<13-6,ESPOSITO>他住在霍博肯
<13-6,ESPOSITO>He lives in Hoboken.

369
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,540
<14-1,RYAN>纽约警局
<14-1,RYAN>NYPD!

370
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,720
<14-2,ESPOSITO>兄弟  我想告诉你
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Hey, bro. I just want you to know...

371
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,130
<14-2,ESPOSITO>我觉得你应该知道
<14-2,ESPOSITO>I just thought you should know

372
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,580
<14-2,ESPOSITO>我很珍视我们的友谊
<14-2,ESPOSITO>that I really value our friendship.

373
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,430
<14-3,CASTLE>好吧  谢了
<14-3,CASTLE>Okay. Thanks.

374
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,270
<14-4,ESPOSITO>对我来说是无价的
<14-4,ESPOSITO>It's priceless to me.

375
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,890
<14-5,CASTLE>很好
<14-5,CASTLE>Great.

376
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,620
<14-6,ESPOSITO>如果我们能给它定个价  你觉得是多少
<14-6,ESPOSITO>But if we could put a price on it, what would that be?

377
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,060
<14-7,CASTLE>你在说什么呢
<14-7,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

378
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,110
<14-8,ESPOSITO>我只想知道我们的友谊值多少
<14-8,ESPOSITO>I just want to know how much our friendship would be worth

379
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,000
<14-8,ESPOSITO>如果你...
<14-8,ESPOSITO>if you were--

380
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,990
<14-9,CASTLE>死了
<14-9,CASTLE>Dead!

381
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,640
<14-10,BECKETT>我们来晚了
<14-10,BECKETT>We got to Bennett too late.

382
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,440
<14-11,RYAN>对  晚了差不多两天
<14-11,RYAN>Yeah, uh, about two days too late.

383
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,310
<14-11,RYAN>看起来他死了有两天了
<14-11,RYAN>That looks like about how long he's been dead.

384
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,630
<14-11,RYAN>他不可能杀死瓦尔
<14-11,RYAN>He couldn't have killed Val.

385
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,620
<14-12,BECKETT>而他四天前
<14-12,BECKETT>And he got a package

386
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,120
<14-12,BECKETT>和瓦尔一样收到了装有光盘的包裹
<14-12,BECKETT>with a disc in it just like Val, four days ago.

387
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
<14-13,ESPOSITO>这里也断电了
<14-13,ESPOSITO>There was a blackout here, too.

388
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,990
<14-13,ESPOSITO>同样的作案手法  同样吓人的尸体
<14-13,ESPOSITO>Same M.O., same freaky-ass body.

389
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,460
<14-13,ESPOSITO>第三个午夜
<14-13,ESPOSITO>The third day at midnight.

390
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,860
<14-14,CASTLE>我就知道不该让你看那光盘
<14-14,CASTLE>I knew I shouldn't have let you watch that disc.

391
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,180
<14-14,CASTLE>现在不到48小时
<14-14,CASTLE>Now in 48 hours...

392
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,290
<14-14,CASTLE>我们俩都会死
<14-14,CASTLE>We'll both be dead.

395
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,950
<15-1,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在杰森家发现了一堆空运单
<15-1,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. just found a stack of airbills at Jason's place.

396
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,340
<15-2,BECKETT>这么说  杀手用了其中一个
<15-2,BECKETT>So then the killer used one of them

397
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,960
<15-2,BECKETT>寄光碟给瓦尔
<15-2,BECKETT>to send the disc to Val.

398
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,720
<15-3,CASTLE>或许我们该复制一份光盘
<15-3,CASTLE>Maybe we should make a copy of the DVD

399
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,810
<15-3,CASTLE>寄给别人
<15-3,CASTLE>and send it to someone else.

400
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,340
<15-3,CASTLE>这是《午夜凶铃》里救人的方式
<15-3,CASTLE>That's how they saved people in "The Ring."

401
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,810
<15-4,RYAN>对  可收到拷贝的人都死了
<15-4,RYAN>Yeah, but all those people who got a copy died.

402
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,960
<15-5,ESPOSITO>是啊  你那是把皮球踢给别人
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you'd just be passing the buck off to someone else.

403
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,750
<15-5,ESPOSITO>很冷血  兄弟
<15-5,ESPOSITO>That's cold, bro.

404
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,520
<15-6,CASTLE>好吧  谁有高见
<15-6,CASTLE>Okay, does anyone have a better solution?

405
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,680
<15-6,CASTLE>我们没有对策了
<15-6,CASTLE>Because we need one,

406
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,620
<15-6,CASTLE>就算不为我  也为贝克特着想吧
<15-6,CASTLE>if not for me, at least for Beckett.

407
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,610
<15-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你真好  你宁可把生的希望留给我
<15-7,BECKETT>Castle, that's so sweet. You want me to outlive you?

408
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,660
<15-7,BECKETT>当然了
<15-7,BECKETT>Of course.

409
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,560
<15-8,CASTLE>不然谁为我的无私和牺牲精神歌功颂德
<15-8,CASTLE>Who else is gonna tell my tale of sacrifice and selflessness?

410
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,910
<15-9,BECKETT>好了  我们不必给任何人歌功颂德
<15-9,BECKETT>Okay, we won't be telling anyone anything.

411
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,190
<15-9,BECKETT>我们都不会有事
<15-9,BECKETT>We're both gonna be fine.

412
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,020
<15-10,CASTLE>都有两个看过光碟的人死了
<15-10,CASTLE>How can you say that when we have not one

413
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,330
<15-10,CASTLE>你怎么还能说这话
<15-10,CASTLE>but two dead DVD watchers?

414
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,720
<15-11,BECKETT>这两名死者除了那张光碟
<15-11,BECKETT>There's gotta be a better connection

415
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,130
<15-11,BECKETT>一定还有更合理的联系
<15-11,BECKETT>between our two victims than that disc.

416
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,870
<15-11,BECKETT>莱恩  去问下杰森的家人
<15-11,BECKETT>Ryan, can you check in with Jason's family,

417
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,360
<15-11,BECKETT>看有没有人认识瓦尔
<15-11,BECKETT>see if anyone recognizes Val?

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,270
<15-12,RYAN>好  这就去
<15-12,RYAN>Yeah. On it.

419
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,700
<15-13,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  你不如去对照一下他们的档案
<15-13,BECKETT>Espo, why don't you cross-reference their records

420
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,620
<15-13,BECKETT>看他们俩之间是否有相似点
<15-13,BECKETT>and see if there are any similarities between the two of them?

421
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,050
<15-14,CASTLE>如果我们俩的照片要贴在那板上
<15-14,CASTLE>You know, if there's gonna be pictures of us hanging up there,

422
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,400
<15-14,CASTLE>我们现在就该选照片了
<15-14,CASTLE>we should really pick 'em out now.

423
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,520
<15-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<15-15,BECKETT>You know, Castle...

424
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,750
<15-15,BECKETT>我们可以用那张
<15-15,BECKETT>We could always use the photo

425
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,060
<15-15,BECKETT>我前几天给你拍的床照
<15-15,BECKETT>that I took of you in bed the other night.

426
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,830
<15-16,CASTLE>我不确定我想给大家留下那种印象
<15-16,CASTLE>I don't know if that's how I want to be remembered.

427
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,620
<15-16,CASTLE>卡塞尔  我开玩笑的
<15-16,CASTLE>Castle, I was joking.

428
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,680
<15-17,BECKETT>我们的照片不会贴在那块板上
<15-17,BECKETT>There will be no photos of us on that murder board.

429
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,260
<15-17,BECKETT>到明天  我们会找到
<15-17,BECKETT>By tomorrow, we are gonna find a connection

430
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,220
<15-17,BECKETT>这两名死者的联系
<15-17,BECKETT>between our two victims

431
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,710
<15-17,BECKETT>指引我们找到真实存在的凶手
<15-17,BECKETT>that will leads us straight to a flesh-and-blood killer.

432
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,750
<15-17,BECKETT>与此同时
<15-17,BECKETT>In the meantime...

433
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,050
<15-17,BECKETT>现在不早了  好吗
<15-17,BECKETT>It's getting kinda late, okay?

434
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,450
<15-17,BECKETT>我们就查到这里吧
<15-17,BECKETT>So why don't we just call it a night?

435
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,700
<15-17,BECKETT>知道吗  其实
<15-17,BECKETT>You know what? Actually...

436
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,110
<15-17,BECKETT>我们今晚可以回我家
<15-17,BECKETT>We could go back to my place tonight

437
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,570
<15-17,BECKETT>多拍点照片
<15-17,BECKETT>and take some more photos.

438
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,130
<15-17,BECKETT>我可能相信
<15-17,BECKETT>Well, I might be convin--

439
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,280
<15-18,CASTLE>等等
<15-18,CASTLE>Whoa. Wait a minute.

440
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,220
<15-18,CASTLE>我看过的每部恐怖片里
<15-18,CASTLE>In every horror movie I've ever seen...

441
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,230
<15-18,CASTLE>做爱几乎保证了
<15-18,CASTLE>Having sex pretty much guarantees

442
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,140
<15-18,CASTLE>我们会死
<15-18,CASTLE>we will die.

443
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,300
<15-18,CASTLE>所以为了我们俩的安全
<15-18,CASTLE>So... for the safety of us both,

444
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,890
<15-18,CASTLE>我们先忍忍吧
<15-18,CASTLE>I say we just hold off.

445
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,820
<15-19,BECKETT>你确定
<15-19,BECKETT>Are you sure?

446
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,840
<15-19,BECKETT>你想想  卡塞尔
<15-19,BECKETT>I mean, think about it, Castle.

447
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,760
<15-19,BECKETT>这可能是我们最后一次
<15-19,BECKETT>This could be our last time.

448
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,320
<15-19,BECKETT>没关系
<15-19,BECKETT>That's--okay...

449
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,810
<15-20,CASTLE>你现在做的事
<15-20,CASTLE>What you're doing right now,

450
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,230
<15-20,CASTLE>是帮倒忙  而且...
<15-20,CASTLE>this is not helping. This--

451
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,750
<15-20,CASTLE>我要走了  远离诱惑
<15-20,CASTLE>I'm gonna... remove myself from temptation.

452
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,720
<15-20,CASTLE>好好睡一晚我就能想出好点子了
<15-20,CASTLE>A good night's sleep will give me some perspective.

453
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,600
<16-1,CASTLE>我  这...
<16-1,CASTLE>I--this is...

454
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,250
<16-2,WES CRAVEN>喂
<16-2,WES CRAVEN>Hello.

455
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,190
<16-3,CASTLE>韦斯[《惊声尖叫》导演]  我是里奇
<16-3,CASTLE>Wes. Hey, it's Rick.

456
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,840
<16-4,WES CRAVEN>天呐  里奇  这大半夜的
<16-4,WES CRAVEN>Jeez, Rick. It's after midnight.

457
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,910
<16-5,CASTLE>我知道  抱歉  我需要点建议
<16-5,CASTLE>Yeah, sorry. I just, um, I need some advice.

459
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,250
<16-6,WES CRAVEN>打扑克又输给史蒂芬·金了
<16-6,WES CRAVEN>Is Stephen King beating you at Texas hold'em again?

460
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,510
<16-6,WES CRAVEN>怎么可能
<16-6,WES CRAVEN>Yeah, right.

461
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,380
<16-7,CASTLE>不是  其实是关于你的电影
<16-7,CASTLE>No, but, um, this is actually about your movies.

463
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,550
<16-7,CASTLE>韦斯·克雷文就是恐怖的代名词
<16-7,CASTLE>I mean, the name Wes Craven is synonymous with horror.

464
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,430
<16-7,CASTLE>你靠把大家吓得屁滚尿流赚得盆满钵满
<16-7,CASTLE>You've made a fortune scaring the crap out of people.

465
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,450
<16-7,CASTLE>《夺魂盛筵》
<16-7,CASTLE>"My Soul To Take,"

466
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,950
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>《猛鬼街》系列
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>All the "Nightmare On Elm Streets,"

467
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,960
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>恐怖至极
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>terrifying.

468
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,450
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>你半夜给我打电话
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>So you called me up in the middle of the night

469
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,910
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>是为了加入我的粉丝会吗
<16-8,WES CRAVEN>to join my fan club, what?

470
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,960
<16-9,CASTLE>当然不是
<16-9,CASTLE>Ha ha. No.

471
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,710
<16-9,CASTLE>我知道你为你所有影片中
<16-9,CASTLE>I know that you've researched evil spirits

472
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,700
<16-9,CASTLE>来自地府的幽灵都做过调查
<16-9,CASTLE>who reach out from the beyond for all your films.

473
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,880
<16-10,WES CRAVEN>当然
<16-10,WES CRAVEN>Of course.

474
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,520
<16-11,CASTLE>我只是好奇你是否知道
<16-11,CASTLE>I was just wondering if you knew

475
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,660
<16-11,CASTLE>怎样抵挡这些讨厌鬼
<16-11,CASTLE>how to stop those pesky suckers.

476
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,070
<16-12,WES CRAVEN>你是要制作自己的电影吗
<16-12,WES CRAVEN>Is this you making your own movie?

477
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,190
<16-12,WES CRAVEN>你在写恐怖片剧本吗
<16-12,WES CRAVEN>I mean, are you writing a horror screenplay?

478
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,340
<16-12,WES CRAVEN>对
<16-12,WES CRAVEN>Yes.

479
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,620
<16-13,CASTLE>我只是想跟你良性竞争一下
<16-13,CASTLE>I just thought I'd give you a little friendly competition.

480
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,140
<16-13,CASTLE>只是遇到了瓶颈
<16-13,CASTLE>Just got a little writer's block is all.

481
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,610
<16-14,WES CRAVEN>好吧  什么故事
<16-14,WES CRAVEN>Okay, what's the story?

482
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,150
<16-15,CASTLE>粗犷英俊的男主角
<16-15,CASTLE>Um... ruggedly handsome hero

483
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,280
<16-15,CASTLE>和他十分不讲迷信的女友
<16-15,CASTLE>and his notoriously practical lady friend

484
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,160
<16-15,CASTLE>看了张据说会在三天内杀死观看者的光碟
<16-15,CASTLE>watch a disc that's killing its viewers within three days.

485
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,650
<16-16,WES CRAVEN>是吗  你不觉得这缺乏创意吗
<16-16,WES CRAVEN>Really? You don't think that's a little derivative?

486
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,700
<16-17,CASTLE>是的  可我希望结局别出心裁
<16-17,CASTLE>Yes, but I am hoping to distinguish the ending,

487
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,730
<16-17,CASTLE>故事最后  主角都活了下来
<16-17,CASTLE>You know, make the third act a, um, survival tale

488
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,530
<16-17,CASTLE>而不是全都死光
<16-17,CASTLE>rather than a bloodbath.

489
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,970
<16-17,CASTLE>我只是想不出
<16-17,CASTLE>I just can't... figure out

490
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,090
<16-17,CASTLE>怎么让主角脱离危险
<16-17,CASTLE>how to get my heroes out of this mess.

491
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,490
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>关键总是在于鬼怪的原始故事
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>So the key is always in the spirit's origin story.

492
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,210
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>一旦你找到出处
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>Once you have that,

493
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,830
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>就能开始找出鬼怪的弱点
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>you can start to figure out the spirit's weaknesses.

494
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,650
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>如果它使用光碟作为进入我们世界的大门
<16-18,WES CRAVEN>If it's using the disc as its portal into our world...

495
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,470
<16-19,CASTLE>那光碟也会包含种种
<16-19,CASTLE>Then the disc would contain clues

496
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,290
<16-19,CASTLE>鬼怪故事的线索
<16-19,CASTLE>as to the spirit's story.

497
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,110
<16-19,CASTLE>韦斯  谢谢
<16-19,CASTLE>Wes, thank you.

498
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,040
<16-19,CASTLE>谢谢  听着  哥们  很晚了  我得挂了
<16-19,CASTLE>Thank you. Listen, buddy, it's late. I gotta go.

499
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,120
<16-20,WES CRAVEN>良性竞争个鬼啊
<16-20,WES CRAVEN>Friendly competition, my ass.

500
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,740
<17-1,BECKETT>你们一定在开玩笑
<17-1,BECKETT>You guys have gotta be kidding me.

501
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,160
<17-1,BECKETT>没发现这两个死者的任何关联
<17-1,BECKETT>We didn't find a single connection between our victims?

502
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,710
<17-2,ESPOSITO>没  这两个人风马牛不相干
<17-2,ESPOSITO>No, the two were as different as night and day.

503
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,780
<17-3,RYAN>杰森是个退休军医
<17-3,RYAN>Jason was a retired ex-army doc.

504
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,400
<17-3,RYAN>瓦尔是个年轻的曼哈顿广告主管
<17-3,RYAN>Val was a young Manhattan ad exec.

505
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,680
<17-4,ESPOSITO>瓦尔生在佛罗里达  杰森在爱荷华长大
<17-4,ESPOSITO>Val was born in Florida. Jason grew up in Iowa.

506
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,230
<17-5,RYAN>他们没共同朋友  也没亲属关系
<17-5,RYAN>They didn't share any friends and they weren't family.

507
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,500
<17-6,BECKETT>杰森的亲人都认不出瓦尔的照片
<17-6,BECKETT>And none of Jason's relatives recognized Val's photo?

508
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,810
<17-7,ESPOSITO>对  而且瓦尔的家人
<17-7,ESPOSITO>No, and nobody from Val's family

509
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,290
<17-7,ESPOSITO>也都没见过或听过杰森
<17-7,ESPOSITO>had ever seen or heard of Jason.

510
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,450
<17-8,RYAN>我们还在细查他们的档案
<17-8,RYAN>We're still looking through their records,

511
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,550
<17-8,RYAN>可目前一无所获
<17-8,RYAN>but so far, nothing.

512
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,640
<17-9,BECKETT>那我们走到死胡同了
<17-9,BECKETT>So we're at a dead end?

513
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,250
<17-10,CASTLE>未必
<17-10,CASTLE>Ah, maybe not.

514
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,730
<17-10,CASTLE>我想了又想
<17-10,CASTLE>After much reflection,

515
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,170
<17-10,CASTLE>发现问题关键在于
<17-10,CASTLE>I realized the key to solving this

516
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,360
<17-10,CASTLE>弄清光盘上的故事
<17-10,CASTLE>is figuring out the story on the DVD.

517
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,420
<17-10,CASTLE>为了这个目的
<17-10,CASTLE>To that end,

518
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,700
<17-10,CASTLE>我把一副图像发给了我的"信众"  集思广益
<17-10,CASTLE>I crowdsourced one of the images to my legion of followers.

519
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,350
<17-11,RYAN>有人认出来了吗
<17-11,RYAN>And someone recognized it?

520
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,170
<17-12,CASTLE>那还用说
<17-12,CASTLE>Oh, you betcha.

521
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,470
<17-12,CASTLE>据炫猫39称
<17-12,CASTLE>According to be dazzle cats 39,

522
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,610
<17-12,CASTLE>这就是布伦瑞克旅馆
<17-12,CASTLE>You're looking at the Brunswick Inn

523
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,050
<17-12,CASTLE>在坎贝尔港
<17-12,CASTLE>in port campbell.

524
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,940
<18-1,RYAN>说对了
<18-1,RYAN>Bingo.

525
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,350
<18-1,RYAN>瓦尔的信用卡记录显示她于2008年11月
<18-1,RYAN>Val's credit card records show that she spent a few nights

526
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,880
<18-1,RYAN>在布伦瑞克旅馆住过几晚
<18-1,RYAN>at the Brunswick Inn in november 2008.

527
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,670
<18-2,ESPOSITO>貌似杰森也在那儿住过
<18-2,ESPOSITO>And it looks like Jason crashed there, too,

528
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,150
<18-2,ESPOSITO>也是在2008年11月
<18-2,ESPOSITO>also in november 2008.

529
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,220
<18-3,BECKETT>那么两名死者在同一段时间
<18-3,BECKETT>Okay, so both of our victims stayed at that inn

530
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,420
<18-3,BECKETT>都在那个旅馆
<18-3,BECKETT>at the same time.

531
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,440
<18-3,BECKETT>也许他们俩有一腿
<18-3,BECKETT>So maybe they were having an affair.

532
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,520
<18-4,RYAN>2008年的时候  瓦尔24岁
<18-4,RYAN>Well, in 2008, Val would've been 24.

533
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,880
<18-4,RYAN>杰森66岁  有一腿的话...
<18-4,RYAN>Jason would've been 66. An affair would've been--

534
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,460
<18-6,RYAN>-恶心  -我刚想说不太可能
<18-6,RYAN>- Gross. - I was gonna say unlikely.

535
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,780
<18-7,ESPOSITO>看起来不像是有一腿
<18-7,ESPOSITO>It doesn't look like an affair.

536
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,940
<18-7,ESPOSITO>他们没住同一间房
<18-7,ESPOSITO>They stayed in separate rooms.

537
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,990
<18-8,RYAN>两名死者当时都在旅馆
<18-8,RYAN>Well, the victims were at the inn.

538
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,120
<18-8,RYAN>旅馆又出现在碟片上  中间肯定有联系
<18-8,RYAN>The inn was on the disc. There's gotta be a connection.

539
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,330
<18-9,CASTLE>旅馆肯定发生了
<18-9,CASTLE>The inn must be the place

540
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,630
<18-9,CASTLE>可怖的闹鬼事件
<18-9,CASTLE>where some unspeakable horror befell the spirits.

541
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,390
<18-9,CASTLE>想想吧
<18-9,CASTLE>Think about it.

542
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,280
<18-9,CASTLE>《午夜凶铃》《惊魂记》《闪灵》
<18-9,CASTLE>"The Ring," "Psycho," "The Shining"--

543
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,810
<18-9,CASTLE>恐怖的旧旅馆
<18-9,CASTLE>It's when we get to the creepy old motel

544
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,110
<18-9,CASTLE>是一切灵异故事的开始
<18-9,CASTLE>that everything starts really going south.

545
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,890
<18-9,CASTLE>这里肯定是鬼故事的始发地
<18-9,CASTLE>So this must the location of the spirit's origin story.

546
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,890
<18-10,BECKETT>或者瓦尔和杰森在那个旅馆
<18-10,BECKETT>Or somehow Val and Jason connected with

547
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,060
<18-10,BECKETT>与人类杀手产生了某种联系
<18-10,BECKETT>the human killer at that inn.

548
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,330
<18-11,CASTLE>我的版本更好
<18-11,CASTLE>My version's better.

549
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,930
<18-12,BECKETT>你们去查一下布伦瑞克旅馆
<18-12,BECKETT>Why don't you look into the Brunswick Inn?

550
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,920
<18-12,BECKETT>看看有什么危险信号  过往罪案
<18-12,BECKETT>See if there any red flags, past crimes.

551
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,260
<18-12,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去坎贝尔港
<18-12,BECKETT>Castle and I will go to Port Campbell

552
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,330
<18-12,BECKETT>看能找到什么线索
<18-12,BECKETT>and see what we can find.

553
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,980
<18-13,CASTLE>或许我应该  留在这里
<18-13,CASTLE>Maybe I should... stay here.

554
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,820
<18-13,CASTLE>我是说
<18-13,CASTLE>I mean,

555
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,600
<18-13,CASTLE>旅馆只是谜题的一部分
<18-13,CASTLE>The inn is just one piece of the puzzle.

556
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,570
<18-13,CASTLE>我要查查视频里的其它影像
<18-13,CASTLE>I should really check the other images on the video,

557
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,000
<18-13,CASTLE>看能找到什么线索
<18-13,CASTLE>see what I can figure out.

558
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,340
<18-14,RYAN>你自愿再看一遍视频吗
<18-14,RYAN>Whoa. You're volunteering to watch that thing again?

559
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,660
<18-15,CASTLE>是啊  反正我只能死一次
<18-15,CASTLE>Yeah. Not like I can get any deader.

561
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,780
<18-15,CASTLE>有人吗
<18-15,CASTLE>Hello.

562
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,080
<19-1,BECKETT>看来这里没人
<19-1,BECKETT>It doesn't look like there's anyone here.

563
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,900
<19-2,ESPOSITO>至少在这个世纪  没人来过
<19-2,ESPOSITO>Doesn't look like anyone's been here this century.

564
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,310
<19-3,BECKETT>你不相信卡塞尔那套荒谬的鬼魂理论吧
<19-3,BECKETT>You're not buying into Castle's spirit craziness,are you?

565
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,540
<19-3,BECKETT>当然不信
<19-3,BECKETT>No.

566
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,040
<19-4,ESPOSITO>你以为我会怕那些老套的篝火故事吗
<19-4,ESPOSITO>You think I'm afraid of some old campfire story?

567
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,620
<19-4,ESPOSITO>-我不是小孩子了  -需要帮忙吗
<19-4,ESPOSITO>- I'm a grown-ass man. - Need help?

568
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,360
<19-5,MITCH>我解释下
<19-5,MITCH>Just so you know,

569
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,290
<19-6,ESPOSITO>我只是被吓了一下  不是害怕
<19-6,ESPOSITO>that was me being startled, not scared.

570
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,230
<19-7,ESPOSITO>旅馆是你开的吗
<19-7,ESPOSITO>You run this place?

571
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,850
<19-8,MITCH>开了41年了  但你们来得不巧
<19-8,MITCH>41 years now, but you're in the wrong place.

572
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,280
<19-8,MITCH>我们旅馆这季不开放
<19-8,MITCH>We're closed for the season.

573
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,210
<19-9,BECKETT>我们就问你几个问题
<19-9,BECKETT>We just need to ask you a few questions.

574
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,720
<19-9,BECKETT>你认得这两个人吗
<19-9,BECKETT>Uh, do you recognize these people?

575
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,430
<19-9,BECKETT>瓦尔·巴特勒和杰森·本内特  他们
<19-9,BECKETT>Val Butler and Jason Bennett-- they--

576
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,710
<19-9,BECKETT>他们2008年曾留宿在这里
<19-9,BECKETT>they stayed here back in 2008.

577
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,740
<19-10,MITCH>2008年  好久了  来来往往很多人
<19-10,MITCH>Long time ago, 2008. Seen a lot of faces come and go.

578
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,000
<19-11,BECKETT>他们是11月住在这里的
<19-11,BECKETT>They would've been here in november.

579
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,720
<19-11,BECKETT>你记得那段时间有什么不寻常的事吗
<19-11,BECKETT>Do you remember anything unusual from that period?

580
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,190
<19-12,MITCH>你们知道他们的房号吗
<19-12,MITCH>You wouldn't happen to know their room numbers.

581
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,050
<19-13,ESPOSITO>知道  213和313
<19-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, uh, 213 and 313.

582
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,590
<19-14,MITCH>13号房间  那些房间  不是...
<19-14,MITCH>THE 13s. Those rooms, they're not...

583
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,980
<19-14,MITCH>一般的房间
<19-14,MITCH>normal rooms.

584
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,140
<19-14,MITCH>当时留给了法院庭审的涉案人员
<19-14,MITCH>They're reserved for people involved in trials at the courthouse,

585
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,550
<19-14,MITCH>在1135号区
<19-14,MITCH>down at 1135 elm.

586
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,160
<19-15,ESPOSITO>1135  跟包裹上的邮政信箱号码一致
<19-15,ESPOSITO>1135, that's the same number as the P.O. Box on that package.

587
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,340
<19-16,BECKETT>那就是了
<19-16,BECKETT>That's gotta be it, then.

588
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,130
<19-16,BECKETT>凶手肯定跟08年在法院的庭审
<19-16,BECKETT>The murders have to be connected to a trial

589
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,660
<19-16,BECKETT>有一些联系
<19-16,BECKETT>held at the courthouse in november of '08.

590
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,760
<19-17,MITCH>08年11月只审了一个案子
<19-17,MITCH>There was only one trial took place in november '08.

591
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
<19-17,MITCH>那是个可怕的案子
<19-17,MITCH>It was a terrible thing.

592
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,900
<19-18,ESPOSITO>你还记得五年前的庭审吗
<19-18,ESPOSITO>You remember a trial from five years ago?

593
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,660
<19-19,MITCH>谁都忘不了
<19-19,MITCH>No one here can forget.

594
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,570
<19-19,MITCH>那可是世纪审判
<19-19,MITCH>It was the trial of the century.

595
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,560
<19-19,MITCH>那人杀了六个人
<19-19,MITCH>That man murdered half a dozen people.

596
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,240
<19-20,BECKETT>你说的是谁
<19-20,BECKETT>Who are you talking about?

597
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,800
<19-21,MITCH>奈杰尔·马利瑞
<19-21,MITCH>Nigel Malloy.

598
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,490
<19-22,BECKETT>那个连环杀手
<19-22,BECKETT>The serial killer?

599
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,530
<20-1,RYAN>一切都和奈杰尔·马利瑞有关
<20-1,RYAN>This is all about Nigel Malloy.

600
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,890
<20-2,CASTLE>这下都说得通了
<20-2,CASTLE>It makes perfect sense.

601
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,670
<20-2,CASTLE>光盘里的钟楼
<20-2,CASTLE>The clock tower from the DVD

602
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,900
<20-2,CASTLE>与他受审法院的钟楼是一样的
<20-2,CASTLE>it's the same clock tower from the courthouse where he was tried.

603
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,450
<20-3,RYAN>屋顶和小巷
<20-3,RYAN>The rooftop and the alley

604
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,700
<20-3,RYAN>是第三第四起凶案的犯罪现场
<20-3,RYAN>were the scenes of his third and fourth murders.

605
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,290
<20-4,CASTLE>然后杰森和瓦尔
<20-4,CASTLE>Yeah, and Jason and Val--

606
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,440
<20-4,CASTLE>都是08连环凶杀案的目击证人
<20-4,CASTLE>both witnesses in his 2008 murder trial.

607
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,280
<20-5,BECKETT>那么奈杰尔·马利瑞一定会报复
<20-5,BECKETT>Okay, so somehow Nigel Malloy must be taking revenge

608
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,580
<20-5,BECKETT>指证他的人
<20-5,BECKETT>against the people that testified against him.

609
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,570
<20-6,CASTLE>但是有一个问题
<20-6,CASTLE>Uh, yeah, there's only one problem.

610
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,620
<20-6,CASTLE>奈杰尔·马利瑞已经死了
<20-6,CASTLE>Nigel Malloy is dead.

611
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,140
<20-6,CASTLE>三年前死于狱中
<20-6,CASTLE>He died in prison three years ago.

612
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,170
<21-1,CASTLE>奈杰尔·马利瑞  人称"死神"
<21-1,CASTLE>Nigel Malloy -- they called him "The Grim Reaper. "

613
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,310
<21-1,CASTLE>他的标志性手段是
<21-1,CASTLE>His signature--

614
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,700
<21-1,CASTLE>就像我们在视频里看到的灼伤标记
<21-1,CASTLE>searing symbols like the ones we saw in the video

615
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,220
<21-1,CASTLE>直接烫在死者的皮肉上
<21-1,CASTLE>into the flesh of his victims.

616
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,150
<21-2,RYAN>原来瓦尔和杰森目击了
<21-2,RYAN>Turns out that Val and Jason were witnesses

617
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,050
<21-2,RYAN>马利瑞绑架第一起命案的死者艾瑟尔·阿隆佐
<21-2,RYAN>to the kidnapping of Malloy's first victim -- Esther Alonzo.

618
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,360
<21-3,CASTLE>他把她从新泽西的游乐园绑架过来
<21-3,CASTLE>He abducted her from an amusement park in New Jersey.

619
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,580
<21-3,CASTLE>在地下室里折磨了几天才杀死她
<21-3,CASTLE>tortured her in his basement for days before killing her.

620
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,540
<21-4,RYAN>他让当地警方忙得团团转
<21-4,RYAN>He had the local police running around in circles.

621
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,590
<21-4,RYAN>他们甚至还抓错了人
<21-4,RYAN>They even arrested the wrong guy

622
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,670
<21-4,RYAN>在他杀了五个人之后才抓到
<21-4,RYAN>before capturing him five bodies later.

623
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,190
<21-5,BECKETT>考虑到他死在狱中
<21-5,BECKETT>Well, considering he died in prison,

624
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,480
<21-5,BECKETT>我得说他在这两起凶案的不在场证明成立了
<21-5,BECKETT>I'd say he has a pretty good alibi for our two murders.

625
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,640
<21-5,BECKETT>凶手另有其人
<21-5,BECKETT>It's gotta be someone else.

626
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,490
<21-6,CASTLE>别那么肯定
<21-6,CASTLE>Don't be so sure.

627
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,390
<21-6,CASTLE>看看他死前接受采访时
<21-6,CASTLE>Take a look at what Nigel Malloy said in an interview he did...

628
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,870
<21-6,CASTLE>说的话
<21-6,CASTLE>right before he died.

629
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,820
<21-7,INTERVIEWER>马利瑞先生
<21-7,INTERVIEWER>So, Mr. Malloy,

630
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,630
<21-7,INTERVIEWER>你说你相信自己不会死吗
<21-7,INTERVIEWER>are you saying you actually believe you can't die?

631
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,040
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>我杀死的人让我深刻洞悉了死亡
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>My victims gave me unique insight into death,

632
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,860
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>死亡的秘密
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>into its secrets.

633
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,410
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>即使我的肉身毁灭了  灵魂会延续
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>Even when my body perishes, my essence will continue on.

634
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,570
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>我会一直活下去
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>I will continue on.

635
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,720
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>你看
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>You see...

636
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,510
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>死亡仅仅是开始
<21-8,NIGEL MALLOY>death is just the beginning.

637
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,840
<21-9,BECKETT>他为"精神病患者"[惊魂记直译]注入了新含义
<21-9,BECKETT>That guy gives a whole new meaning to the word "Psycho. "

638
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,830
<21-10,CASTLE>如果他真的找到了延续灵魂的方法呢
<21-10,CASTLE>What if he did... find a way to let his spirit live on?

639
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,570
<21-11,RYAN>就像那些惊悚片里的杀手
<21-11,RYAN>Like the killer in those chucky movies

640
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,800
<21-11,RYAN>把灵魂注入吓人的玩偶里
<21-11,RYAN>who transferred his spirit into that spooky doll.

641
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,000
<21-12,CASTLE>正是如此  只不过这次不是玩偶  是光盘
<21-12,CASTLE>Exactly, only instead of a doll, It's a DVD.

642
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,990
<21-12,CASTLE>这就解释了"见者死"的预言
<21-12,CASTLE>That explains the message "You saw, you die. "

643
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,550
<21-12,CASTLE>目击者看了到他作案所以必须死
<21-12,CASTLE>The witnesses saw his crimes so they must die.

644
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,190
<21-13,BECKETT>按照这个逻辑  我们都不会死
<21-13,BECKETT>Well, then given that logic, we'd both be okay

645
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,400
<21-13,BECKETT>因为我们不是目击证人
<21-13,BECKETT>because we're not witnesses.

646
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,920
<21-14,CASTLE>但你是个警察  我是个警察  助手
<21-14,CASTLE>But you're a cop. I'm a cop... helper.

647
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,310
<21-14,CASTLE>我是说  你不觉得一个被判刑的连环杀手
<21-14,CASTLE>I mean, you don't think a convicted serial killer

648
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,350
<21-14,CASTLE>会对纽约警局心怀怨恨吗
<21-14,CASTLE>is gonna have an ax to grind with the NYPD?

649
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,500
<21-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这事跟奈杰尔·马利瑞无关
<21-15,BECKETT>Castle,  Nigel Malloy is not involved.

650
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,570
<21-15,BECKETT>他已经死了
<21-15,BECKETT>He's dead.

651
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,510
<21-15,BECKETT>但或许有别人代替他作案
<21-15,BECKETT>But someone else might be acting on his behalf.

652
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,380
<21-15,BECKETT>莱恩  跟坎贝尔港的地区检察官谈谈
<21-15,BECKETT>Ryan, talk to the D. A. in port campbell.

653
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,660
<21-15,BECKETT>找到其他那些目击证人  并确保他们的安全
<21-15,BECKETT>Let's locate those other witnesses and make sure they're safe.

654
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,250
<21-17,CASTLE>-好的  -法庭记录都被封存了
<21-17,CASTLE>- Yeah. - The court records were sealed.

655
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,410
<21-17,CASTLE>凶手怎么知道目击证人有哪些
<21-17,CASTLE>How would the killer know who the witnesses were?

656
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,670
<21-18,RYAN>等一下
<21-18,RYAN>Uh, w-wait a minute.

657
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,530
<21-18,RYAN>奈杰尔·马利瑞有个弟弟  叫里奥普
<21-18,RYAN>Nigel Malloy had a brother. Leopol

658
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:40,330
<21-18,RYAN>地区检察官曾指控他协助处理尸体
<21-18,RYAN>The D. A. accused him of helping dispose of the bodies.

659
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,600
<21-19,CASTLE>是的  辩护人说过
<21-19,CASTLE>Yes,  the defense said...

660
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,560
<21-19,CASTLE>奈杰尔的弟弟对他言听计从
<21-19,CASTLE>that Nigel had an almost hypnotic hold over his brother.

661
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,510
<21-20,RYAN>他因为精神错乱被判无罪
<21-20,RYAN>He was found not guilty by reason of insanity,

662
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,210
<21-20,RYAN>之后被送去了精神病院
<21-20,RYAN>and they shipped him off to an asylum.

663
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,320
<21-21,BECKETT>-他还在里面吗  -我查一下
<21-21,BECKETT>- Is he still there? - I am checking.

664
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,260
<21-22,RYAN>等等  这可有意思了
<21-22,RYAN>Wait. This is interesting.

665
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,900
<21-23,BECKETT>什么
<21-23,BECKETT>What?

666
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,900
<21-24,RYAN>他进的那家精神病院  在格林威治村
<21-24,RYAN>The asylum that they sent him to,  It's in Greenwich.

667
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,730
<21-25,CASTLE>瓦尔拿到DVD那天就是去了那里
<21-25,CASTLE>That's where Val went the day she got the DVD.

668
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,670
<21-26,BECKETT>她是去见里奥普·马利瑞了
<21-26,BECKETT>She went to see Leopold Malloy.

669
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,680
<22-1,NURSE LOCKHEART>是的  那位年轻小姐几天前确实来过
<22-1,NURSE LOCKHEART>Yes, that young lady did stop by a few days ago.

670
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,470
<22-2,BECKETT>你知道他们谈了什么
<22-2,BECKETT>Do you have any idea what they might have talked about

671
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,920
<22-2,BECKETT>或者他对她说了什么话吗
<22-2,BECKETT>or what he might have said to her?

672
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
<22-3,NURSE LOCKHEART>我恐怕无从知晓  亲爱的
<22-3,NURSE LOCKHEART>I'm afraid not, dear.

673
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,220
<22-3,NURSE LOCKHEART>你得亲自询问马利瑞先生了
<22-3,NURSE LOCKHEART>You'll have to ask Mr. Malloy yourself.

674
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,490
<22-4,CASTLE>我想冒昧地问一下  就是
<22-4,CASTLE>You know, not for nothing,  But...

675
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,180
<22-4,CASTLE>他是什么样的  我是说
<22-4,CASTLE>what's he like? I mean...

676
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,740
<22-4,CASTLE>从有点疯到汉尼拔
<22-4,CASTLE>on a scale of 1 to Hannibal Lecter,

677
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,610
<22-4,CASTLE>我们要面对的是怎样一个人
<22-4,CASTLE>what are we dealing with here?

678
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,180
<22-5,NURSE LOCKHEART>我很抱歉  但医患保密协议
<22-5,NURSE LOCKHEART>I'm sorry,  But doctor-patient privilege

679
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,830
<22-5,NURSE LOCKHEART>不允许我们形容或描述病人的行为
<22-5,NURSE LOCKHEART>prohibits us from characterizing or describing our patients' behavior.

680
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,090
<22-6,BECKETT>不  没关系  我们理解
<22-6,BECKETT>No, that's okay. We understand.

681
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,710
<22-6,BECKETT>到了
<22-6,BECKETT>Here we are.

682
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,240
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>我们来讲一下规定
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>Let's go over the rules.

683
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,610
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>请不要给他任何东西
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>Please don't hand him any objects

684
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,350
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>也不要收他的任何东西
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>or take anything from him.

685
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,930
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>别站得离玻璃太近
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>Don't stand too close to the glass.

686
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,960
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>如果你们需要任何帮助
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>And if you need any help,

687
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,380
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>就按一下身后墙上的红色按钮
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>just press the red button on the wall behind you.

688
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,310
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>好了  请在这里签字
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>Okay, now please just sign here

689
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,480
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>以示你们明白了规定
<22-7,NURSE LOCKHEART>acknowledging that you understand the rules.

690
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,260
<22-8,CASTLE>我感觉就像签字把命卖了一样
<22-8,CASTLE>I feel like I'm signing my life away.

691
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,300
<22-9,NURSE LOCKHEART>但愿不会吧
<22-9,NURSE LOCKHEART>Well, let's hope not.

692
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,650
<23-1,BECKETT>谢谢
<23-1,BECKETT>Thank you.

693
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,450
<23-2,LEOPOLD MALLOY>请  坐吧  很少有人会来探望我
<23-2,LEOPOLD MALLOY>Please... have a seat. I so rarely receive visitors.

694
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,080
<23-3,BECKETT>但最近就有个人来探望过你
<23-3,BECKETT>But you have received a visitor recently.

695
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,310
<23-3,BECKETT>瓦尔·巴特勒  她为什么来找你
<23-3,BECKETT>Val Butler. Why was she here?

696
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,850
<23-4,LEOPOLD>甜美的好姑娘
<23-4,LEOPOLD>Oh, sweet girl.

697
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,130
<23-4,LEOPOLD>她跑来问我有没有寄东西给她
<23-4,LEOPOLD>She came to ask me if I'd sent her something.

698
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,690
<23-5,CASTLE>那你寄了吗
<23-5,CASTLE>And did you?

699
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,040
<23-6,LEOPOLD>我怎么能寄  我没办法寄任何东西给任何人
<23-6,LEOPOLD>How could I? I can't send anything to anyone.

700
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,490
<23-7,BECKETT>你可以让别人寄给她
<23-7,BECKETT>You could've just gotten someone else to send it to her,

701
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,180
<23-7,BECKETT>就像你可以派别人去杀了她一样
<23-7,BECKETT>just like you could've gotten someone else to kill her.

702
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,970
<23-8,LEOPOLD>我为什么要那么做
<23-8,LEOPOLD>And why would I do such a thing?

703
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,350
<23-9,BECKETT>为了延续你哥哥永生的神秘
<23-9,BECKETT>To perpetuate the myth of your brother's immortality...

704
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,440
<23-9,BECKETT>或者为他的死复仇
<23-9,BECKETT>or to avenge his death.

705
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,360
<23-10,LEOPOLD>我不是我哥哥的守护人  贝克特探长
<23-10,LEOPOLD>I am not my brother's keeper, Detective Beckett.

706
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,660
<23-10,LEOPOLD>我从来都不是  我没有他那种杀人的冲动
<23-10,LEOPOLD>I never was, and I don't share his murderous impulses.

707
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,590
<23-11,CASTLE>但你却仍然被关在这里
<23-11,CASTLE>Yet, you're still in here.

708
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,730
<23-11,CASTLE>暂时而已
<23-11,CASTLE>For now.

709
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,790
<23-12,LEOPOLD>但等到我的上诉结果出来  谁知道呢
<23-12,LEOPOLD>But when my appeal comes through, who knows?

710
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,670
<23-12,LEOPOLD>我们某天可能会在大街上相遇哦
<23-12,LEOPOLD>We could all meet on the street one day.

711
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,210
<23-13,CASTLE>真有那一天  我可能会穿过街去
<23-13,CASTLE>On that day, I might cross the street.

712
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,820
<23-14,LEOPOLD>我不会伤害任何人  从来不会
<23-14,LEOPOLD>I'm no danger to anyone. I never was.

713
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,260
<23-14,LEOPOLD>我为什么要参与谋杀案  毁了自己的上诉呢
<23-14,LEOPOLD>So why would I jeopardize my appeal by being party to a murder?

714
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,050
<23-15,BECKETT>因为你很清楚你可以脱罪
<23-15,BECKETT>Because you knew you could get away with it.

715
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,360
<23-15,BECKETT>你被关起来了
<23-15,BECKETT>You're locked up.

716
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,080
<23-15,BECKETT>你拥有完美的不在场证明
<23-15,BECKETT>You have the perfect alibi.

717
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,480
<23-15,BECKETT>我拥有完美的不在场证明  因为我是无辜的
<23-15,BECKETT>I have the perfect alibi because I'm innocent.

718
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,610
<23-16,LEOPOLD>我没有电视或网络
<23-16,LEOPOLD>I don't have TV or internet access.

719
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,330
<23-16,LEOPOLD>我没有发送或接收邮件
<23-16,LEOPOLD>I don't send or receive mail.

720
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,410
<23-16,LEOPOLD>我唯一和外界的接触就是访客
<23-16,LEOPOLD>The only personal contact I have is through visitors,

721
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,600
<23-16,LEOPOLD>瓦尔是我多年来最后一个访客
<23-16,LEOPOLD>And Val is the last one I've had in years.

722
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,630
<23-16,LEOPOLD>我能派谁去杀死她
<23-16,LEOPOLD>So who could I have sent to dispatch her

723
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,340
<23-17,CASTLE>或其他目击证人啊
<23-17,CASTLE>or the other witness?

724
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,820
<23-17,CASTLE>我们从没提过
<23-17,CASTLE>Uh, well, we never actually

725
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,080
<23-17,CASTLE>其他目击证人被杀
<23-17,CASTLE>said anything about the other witness being killed.

726
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,430
<23-17,CASTLE>那么  你是怎么知道这事的
<23-17,CASTLE>So... how would you know anything about that?

727
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,300
<23-18,LEOPOLD>我觉得你们该走了
<23-18,LEOPOLD>I think it's time for you to go.

728
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,770
<23-18,LEOPOLD>我没什么好说的了
<23-18,LEOPOLD>I have nothing more to say.

729
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,300
<24-1,BECKETT>听着  他已经坦白一切了
<24-1,BECKETT>Look, he told us everything.

730
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,510
<24-1,BECKETT>他不小心说漏嘴证明
<24-1,BECKETT>That slipup proves that

731
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,950
<24-1,BECKETT>他一直在跟某人交流关于那些凶案的信息
<24-1,BECKETT>he's been talking with someone about those murders.

732
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,630
<24-2,CASTLE>他还有一种方式可以知道那些信息
<24-2,CASTLE>There is one other way he could've gotten that information.

733
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,280
<24-2,CASTLE>他可能跟他哥哥交流过
<24-2,CASTLE>He could be talking to his brother.

734
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,420
<24-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他肯定是跟外面的人谈过
<24-3,BECKETT>Castle, he was talking with someone on the outside.

735
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,160
<24-3,BECKETT>他不可能和死人交流
<24-3,BECKETT>He hasn't been communing with the dead.

736
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,260
<24-4,CASTLE>我们可不敢完全确定  而且
<24-4,CASTLE>Well, we can't be sure, and...

737
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,870
<24-4,CASTLE>我们没有时间了
<24-4,CASTLE>We're running out of time.

738
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,450
<24-4,CASTLE>我会把我遗愿清单上的第27条划掉
<24-4,CASTLE>So I'm gonna scratch off number 27 on my bucket list.

739
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,650
<24-4,CASTLE>你记得你家餐桌上的
<24-4,CASTLE>You remember that, uh, blue porcelain vase

740
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,880
<24-4,CASTLE>那个蓝色瓷花瓶吗
<24-4,CASTLE>you had on your dining room table?

741
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,440
<24-5,BECKETT>当然  就是被风卷进来摔碎的那个
<24-5,BECKETT>Yeah, the one that the wind blew over.

742
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,730
<24-6,CASTLE>是啊  关于那个
<24-6,CASTLE>Yeah, about that.

743
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,380
<24-6,CASTLE>我当时在客厅打网球游戏
<24-6,CASTLE>I was playing wii tennis in the living room,

744
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,490
<24-7,BECKETT>-你打碎了我的瓷瓶  -花瓶
<24-7,BECKETT>- You broke my vase? - Vase.

745
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,850
<24-8,CASTLE>-说瓷瓶也可以啦  -你知道吗
<24-8,CASTLE>- Vase is acceptable, too. - You know what?

746
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,710
<24-9,BECKETT>你可以不用担心那些鬼魂缠上你了
<24-9,BECKETT>You can stop worrying about the spirits getting to you,

747
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,300
<24-9,BECKETT>因为我有可能会亲手杀了你
<24-9,BECKETT>because I just might kill you myself.

748
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,440
<24-10,CASTLE>不是吧你  要在我们生命的最后一天吵架吗
<24-10,CASTLE>Seriously, you want to spend Our last day on earth fighting?

749
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,320
<24-11,RYAN>莱恩
<24-11,RYAN>Ryan.

750
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,530
<24-12,BECKETT>你去弄张传票  查看那所精神病院的记录
<24-12,BECKETT>Hey, we need you to subpoena records from the asylum.

751
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,280
<24-12,BECKETT>看看里奥普通过电话或邮件跟谁联系过
<24-12,BECKETT>See who Leopold was in contact with by phone or over e-mail.

752
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,020
<24-13,RYAN>好的  但是  我想告诉你
<24-13,RYAN>Yeah, sure, but just so you know,

753
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,230
<24-13,RYAN>案子有了点新进展
<24-13,RYAN>there's been a development.

754
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,280
<24-14,BECKETT>你什么意思  什么新进展
<24-14,BECKETT>What do you mean? What kind of a development?

755
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,900
<24-15,RYAN>我们在查马利瑞家族的信息时
<24-15,RYAN>Well, while looking into the Malloys,

756
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,050
<24-15,RYAN>在一份警方报告中发现了奈杰尔的名字
<24-15,RYAN>Nigel's name came up on a police report.

757
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,560
<24-16,BECKETT>什么报告
<24-16,BECKETT>What kind of a report?

758
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,920
<24-17,RYAN>报告上声称他几天前失踪了
<24-17,RYAN>He was, um... reported missing a few days ago.

759
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,290
<24-18,BECKETT>失踪  那家伙已经死了三年多了
<24-18,BECKETT>Missing? The guy has been dead for over three years.

760
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,680
<24-18,BECKETT>关于那一点
<24-18,BECKETT>Yeah, about that...

761
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,050
<24-19,RYAN>奈杰尔死后所葬入墓地的看守人
<24-19,RYAN>the groundskeeper at the cemetery where Nigel is buried

762
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,040
<24-19,RYAN>注意到他的坟墓被侵扰过
<24-19,RYAN>noticed that his plot has been disturbed.

763
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,040
<24-20,CASTLE>你是说被挖了吗
<24-20,CASTLE>As in "dug up"?

764
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,840
<24-21,RYAN>不仅是被挖了
<24-21,RYAN>Well, not just dug up.

766
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:41,350
<24-21,RYAN>奈杰尔·马利瑞的尸体失踪了
<24-21,RYAN>Nigel Malloy's body has disappeared.

767
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,260
<24-22,CASTLE>那不是消失了
<24-22,CASTLE>It hasn't disappeared.

768
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,740
<24-22,CASTLE>他是死而复生了
<24-22,CASTLE>He's risen from the grave.

770
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,560
<25-1,CASTLE>我们来听听
<25-1,CASTLE>All right. Let's hear it.

771
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,290
<25-2,BECKETT>听什么
<25-2,BECKETT>Hear what?

772
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,660
<25-3,CASTLE>你来解释一下这个
<25-3,CASTLE>Your explanation for this.

773
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,100
<25-3,CASTLE>如果说有什么我可以永远信赖
<25-3,CASTLE>If there's one thing I can always count on,

774
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,360
<25-3,CASTLE>那就是你和你的逻辑  所以嘛
<25-3,CASTLE>It's you and your logic so...

775
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,570
<25-4,BECKETT>你要我解释已故连环杀手的尸体怎么失踪了
<25-4,BECKETT>You want me to explain the dead serial killer's missing body?

776
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,750
<25-5,BECKETT>我不知道怎么回事
<25-5,BECKETT>I don't know what happened here

777
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,220
<25-5,BECKETT>暂时不知道
<25-5,BECKETT>yet.

778
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,050
<25-6,CASTLE>我擦  这也行
<25-6,CASTLE>That's it? That's all you've got?

779
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,620
<25-7,BECKETT>但我肯定这案子和奈杰尔·马利瑞复活
<25-7,BECKETT>But I can assure you that it has nothing to do

780
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,570
<25-7,BECKETT>没有一点关系
<25-7,BECKETT>with Nigel Malloy rising from the dead.

781
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,010
<25-7,BECKETT>是他弟弟
<25-7,BECKETT>It's his brother.

782
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,850
<25-7,BECKETT>里奥普·马利瑞才是幕后黑手
<25-7,BECKETT>Leopold Malloy is behind all of this.

783
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,610
<25-8,ESPOSITO>看来里奥普跟这案子没关系
<25-8,ESPOSITO>It doesn't look like Leopold has anything to do with this.

784
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,260
<25-9,BECKETT>不能吧
<25-9,BECKETT>No,that can't be right.

785
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,070
<25-10,ESPOSITO>这家伙是疯子  可是在一件事上他是对的
<25-10,ESPOSITO>Look,the guy's crazy, But he was right about one thing.

786
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,940
<25-10,ESPOSITO>他没有电话  电子邮箱  只有瓦尔拜访过他
<25-10,ESPOSITO>He has no phone,no e-mail,and no visitors besides Val.

787
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,860
<25-11,BECKETT>肯定有办法证明里奥普是幕后黑手
<25-11,BECKETT>There's gotta be some way of proving that Leopold's behind all this.

788
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,180
<25-12,ESPOSITO>我不知道他是怎么做到的
<25-12,ESPOSITO>I can't tell you how he did it,

789
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,050
<25-12,ESPOSITO>但我知道下一个被害人是谁
<25-12,ESPOSITO>but I can tell you who's next.

790
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,070
<25-12,ESPOSITO>我查了马利瑞案的法庭记录
<25-12,ESPOSITO>I checked into the court documents on the Malloy trial.

791
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,570
<25-12,ESPOSITO>发现了些规律  杰森是第一个证人
<25-12,ESPOSITO>I noticed a pattern. Jason was the first person to testify,

792
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,120
<25-12,ESPOSITO>而他是第一个被害人
<25-12,ESPOSITO>and he was also the first one to die.

793
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,770
<25-12,ESPOSITO>第二天被害的瓦尔  是第二个证人
<25-12,ESPOSITO>A day later, Val, the second person who testified, was killed.

794
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,870
<25-13,BECKETT>好  所以他们是按出庭作证的顺序被害的
<25-13,BECKETT>Okay, so they're being killed in order of their testimonies.

795
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,000
<25-14,CASTLE>谁是第三个
<25-14,CASTLE>Who's lucky number three?

796
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,830
<25-15,ESPOSITO>马克·海勒  我找了他女友
<25-15,ESPOSITO>Uh, Mark Heller. I talked to his girlfriend.

797
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,630
<25-15,ESPOSITO>他三天前收到了光盘
<25-15,ESPOSITO>He received a disc three days ago.

798
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,260
<25-16,CASTLE>也就是说他今晚午夜会死  还有四小时
<25-16,CASTLE>That means he's due to die tonight at midnight. That's in four hours.

799
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,500
<25-17,BECKETT>那马克·海勒现在在哪
<25-17,BECKETT>And where's Mark Heller now?

800
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,510
<25-18,ESPOSITO>不知道
<25-18,ESPOSITO>That's the problem.

801
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,900
<25-18,ESPOSITO>他看完视频后吓傻了
<25-18,ESPOSITO>He watched the video and he freaked out.

802
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,430
<25-18,ESPOSITO>他离开了家  没人知道去哪儿
<25-18,ESPOSITO>He left the house. Nobody knows where he went.

803
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,970
<25-19,RYAN>我知道  海勒的消费记录显示
<25-19,RYAN>I might. Heller's financials show that

804
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,510
<25-19,RYAN>他昨天在金斯敦市外的商店买了东西
<25-19,RYAN>he bought groceries at a store outside Kingston yesterday.

805
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,960
<25-19,RYAN>他们家在那儿有间小屋
<25-19,RYAN>His family owns a Cabin up there.

806
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,030
<25-20,ESPOSITO>估计他就躲在那儿
<25-20,ESPOSITO>That's probably where he's holed up.

807
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,320
<25-21,BECKETT>好  埃斯波西托  你继续查里奥普
<25-21,BECKETT>Okay, Esposito you keep digging into Leopold.

808
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,470
<25-21,BECKETT>莱恩  找出其他证人
<25-21,BECKETT>Ryan... find the other witnesses.

809
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,700
<25-21,BECKETT>确保他们安全
<25-21,BECKETT>Make sure they're safe.

810
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,630
<25-21,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去金斯敦找海勒
<25-21,BECKETT>Castle and I will head off to Kingston and see if we can get Heller.

811
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,780
<25-22,CASTLE>我们要去那个偏僻森林里的小屋吗
<25-22,CASTLE>Uh, we're going to a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere?

812
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,960
<25-23,BECKETT>对  怎么了
<25-23,BECKETT>Yeah. So?

813
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,660
<25-24,CASTLE>这就像是恐怖片里女学生去查看
<25-24,CASTLE>So it's like the co-ed checking out the strange noise in the basement

814
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,980
<25-24,CASTLE>地下室的怪声  这就是惹鬼上身啊
<25-24,CASTLE>in a slasher pic. It's a recipe for disaster.

815
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,660
<25-25,BECKETT>这又不是演恐怖电影  我们是调查凶案
<25-25,BECKETT>It's not a slasher flick. It's a murder investigation.

816
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,180
<25-25,BECKETT>我要去那小屋  你跟不跟去
<25-25,BECKETT>And I'm going up to that cabin. So you coming or what?

817
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,660
<25-26,CASTLE>我不能让你一个人去
<25-26,CASTLE>Well, I can't let you go alone.

818
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,420
<25-27,CASTLE>但我得先准备准备
<25-27,CASTLE>But I need to make a stop first.

819
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,310
<26-1,CASTLE>我带了香火  符咒  照妖镜
<26-1,CASTLE>Okay, so I've got incense, palaspas, bagua mirror.

820
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,820
<26-1,CASTLE>全套的驱鬼利器  鬼挡杀鬼  佛挡杀佛
<26-1,CASTLE>This is a veritable war chest for fighting evil spirits.

821
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,590
<26-2,BECKETT>-那是圣水吗  -对
<26-2,BECKETT>- Is that holy water? - Yeah.

822
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,900
<26-4,BECKETT>你从哪儿弄来的
<26-4,BECKETT>Where'd you get that from?

823
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,740
<26-5,CASTLE>两年前  一个教士开光了送我的
<26-5,CASTLE>A priest blessed this for me two years ago.

824
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,700
<26-6,BECKETT>你就一直留着吗
<26-6,BECKETT>And you just keep it around?

825
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,880
<26-7,CASTLE>我知道总会用得着的
<26-7,CASTLE>Knew it would come in handy one day.

826
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,060
<26-7,CASTLE>好  你想要哪样武器
<26-7,CASTLE>Now... What weapon do you want?

827
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,560
<26-8,BECKETT>我有枪就行了
<26-8,BECKETT>I think I'll be fine with my gun.

828
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,360
<26-9,CASTLE>对于我的看法
<26-9,CASTLE>There's not just one... tiny part of you

829
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,370
<26-9,CASTLE>你就真的一点也不信吗
<26-9,CASTLE>that wonders if I might be right?

830
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,670
<26-11,BECKETT>-喂  贝克特  -莱恩
<26-11,BECKETT>- Hey, Beckett. - Ryan?

831
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,000
<26-12,RYAN>喂  贝克特
<26-12,RYAN>Hey, Beckett?

832
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,630
<26-13,BECKETT>莱恩  我们这儿信号不好
<26-13,BECKETT>Ryan, wh-- I think we're in a bad area.

833
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,170
<26-13,BECKETT>我听不清你说话
<26-13,BECKETT>I'm having a hard time hearing you.

834
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,470
<26-14,RYAN>好的  那我长话短说
<26-14,RYAN>Okay, then I'll make it quick.

835
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,460
<26-14,RYAN>我刚找到最后一个证人
<26-14,RYAN>I just finished with the last of the remaining witnesses.

836
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,500
<26-14,RYAN>他们都没收到光盘
<26-14,RYAN>None of them got a disc.

837
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,900
<26-15,BECKETT>所以凶手只想杀前三个证人
<26-15,BECKETT>So the killer only targeted the first three witnesses.

838
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,800
<26-16,RYAN>有可能是这样  也有可能只是还没动手
<26-16,RYAN>Well, either that or he hasn't gotten around to the others yet.

839
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,400
<26-17,CASTLE>哥们  我们听不见了
<26-17,CASTLE>Dude, you're breaking up.

840
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,770
<26-18,RYAN>先别挂
<26-18,RYAN>Uh, uh, hang on.

841
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,150
<26-19,ESPOSITO>看看这个
<26-19,ESPOSITO>Yo, check this out.

842
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,470
<26-19,ESPOSITO>看来瓦尔  杰森和马克·海勒还有别的共同点
<26-19,ESPOSITO>Looks like Val, Jason, and Mark Heller had something else in common.

843
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,210
<26-20,RYAN>喂  贝克特  我们漏了些事
<26-20,RYAN>Hey, Beckett. We missed something.

844
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,260
<26-20,RYAN>事情不如我们所料  而是另有乾坤
<26-20,RYAN>I-it's not what we think. There's someone else.

845
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,780
<26-21,RYAN>贝克特  贝克特
<26-21,RYAN>Beckett? Beckett.

846
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,410
<27-1,BECKETT>联系不上他了  我完全没信号
<27-1,BECKETT>I can't get him back. I don't have any reception.

847
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,420
<27-2,BECKETT>那是海勒的车  他在这儿
<27-2,BECKETT>There's Heller's car. He's here.

848
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,290
<27-3,CASTLE>嗯  我也完全没信号
<27-3,CASTLE>Yeah, I haven't got any bars either.

849
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,050
<27-4,BECKETT>这地方的确比较偏僻
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we are in the middle of nowhere.

850
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,400
<27-5,CASTLE>还能更糟吗
<27-5,CASTLE>Can this get any worse?

851
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,920
<27-5,CASTLE>一个已故连环杀手离奇失踪
<27-5,CASTLE>A dead serial killer has gone missing,

852
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
<27-5,CASTLE>我俩都看了诅咒光盘
<27-5,CASTLE>we've both seen a cursed disc,

853
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,080
<27-5,CASTLE>身在阴森的林中小屋  手机又没信号
<27-5,CASTLE>we're at a cabin in the woods with no cell phone reception--

854
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,450
<27-5,CASTLE>傻子都知道这故事会怎么发展
<27-5,CASTLE>I don't need Wes Craven to tell me how this ends.

855
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,680
<27-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你得这么想
<27-6,BECKETT>Well, think about it this way, Castle.

856
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,500
<27-6,BECKETT>在所有恐怖电影里
<27-6,BECKETT>In all of those horror movies,

857
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,630
<27-6,BECKETT>-总有人能活下来  -是啊  "有人"而已
<27-6,BECKETT>- someone survives. - Yeah, someone.

858
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,710
<27-7,CASTLE>我俩中的一人
<27-7,CASTLE>One of us.

859
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,970
<27-7,CASTLE>我们中的一人天生风趣幽默
<27-7,CASTLE>And the other one is cursed with being charming and funny.

860
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,250
<27-7,CASTLE>用不着我来告诉你
<27-7,CASTLE>I don't think I need to tell you

861
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,770
<27-7,CASTLE>那些搞笑的角色都是什么下场
<27-7,CASTLE>what kind of chances the comic relief guy has.

862
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,380
<28-1,BECKETT>马克·海勒
<28-1,BECKETT>Mark Heller.

863
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,260
<28-1,BECKETT>马克·海勒
<28-1,BECKETT>Mark Heller?

864
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,370
<28-1,BECKETT>哎呀妈呀
<28-1,BECKETT>Jeez.

865
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,940
<28-3,CASTLE>这装饰太吓人了
<28-3,CASTLE>Can't say I'm a fan of the decor.

866
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,310
<28-4,BECKETT>我也不喜欢  可我们是来
<28-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, neither am I, but we're just here to--

867
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:54,060
<28-5,MARK HELLER>你们要是不走  那就死定了
<28-5,MARK HELLER>Unless you leave, you're gonna die.

868
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,880
<28-6,BECKETT>海勒先生  我是贝克特探长  纽约警局的
<28-6,BECKETT>Mr Heller, I'm Detective Beckett. NYPD.

869
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,860
<28-7,MARK>那你不介意出示你的证件吧
<28-7,MARK>Well, then you won't mind showing me I.D.

870
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,080
<28-7,MARK>我必须保持警惕
<28-7,MARK>I can't be too cautious,

871
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,800
<28-7,MARK>马利瑞案的证人都离奇身亡
<28-7,MARK>Not with Malloy witnesses dropping like flies.

872
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,650
<28-8,BECKETT>我们知道光盘的事
<28-8,BECKETT>Look, we know about the disc.

873
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,180
<28-8,BECKETT>我们是来带你回去的  以便保护你
<28-8,BECKETT>We're here to take you to the precinct, where we can protect you.

874
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,190
<28-9,MARK>你们保护不了我  他回来了
<28-9,MARK>You can't protect me. He's back.

875
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,330
<28-10,CASTLE>马克  按照推断  你还有两分钟就...
<28-10,CASTLE>Look, Mark, if the pattern holds, you got two minutes before...

876
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,570
<28-10,CASTLE>你懂的  所以我们上车再说吧
<28-10,CASTLE>you know, so let's talk about this in the car.

877
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,360
<28-11,MARK>你知道吗  跟马利瑞待在同一个审判室
<28-11,MARK>You know, just being in the same courtroom as Malloy

878
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,520
<28-11,MARK>就足以让大老爷们尿裤子了
<28-11,MARK>was enough to make a grown man wet himself.

879
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,010
<28-11,MARK>那个疯子成天嚷嚷些装神弄鬼的
<28-11,MARK>Psycho yammering about death and rebirth and all that hoo-ha.

880
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,550
<28-12,CASTLE>我们可以上车了聊
<28-12,CASTLE>Okay, hoo-ha we could be talking about--

881
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,180
<28-13,MARK>其实我  瓦尔和杰森
<28-13,MARK>You know, neither me nor Val nor Jason

882
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,680
<28-13,MARK>都不想指证他和其他同伙
<28-13,MARK>wanted to testify against him or the other guy.

883
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,140
<28-14,BECKETT>什么其他同伙
<28-14,BECKETT>What do you mean,the other guy?

884
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,930
<28-14,BECKETT>你是说里奥普吗
<28-14,BECKETT>Are you talking about Leopold?

885
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,990
<28-15,MARK>-老天爷  -时辰到
<28-15,MARK>- Oh, god. - Time's up.

886
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,940
<28-15,MARK>它来了
<28-15,MARK>It's here.

887
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
<29-1,CASTLE>你觉得它会让我俩再活一天吗
<29-1,CASTLE>Do you think it'll matter that we still have a day left

888
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,650
<29-1,CASTLE>还是干脆一次把我们仨都干掉
<29-1,CASTLE>or will I be like a three birds with one stone thing?

889
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,050
<29-2,BECKETT>你家电闸在哪儿
<29-2,BECKETT>Where are your circuit breakers?

890
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,630
<29-3,MARK>-在工具房外  -好
<29-3,MARK>- Outside by the toolshed. - Okay.

891
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,990
<29-4,BECKETT>有人在外面
<29-4,BECKETT>Someone's out there.

892
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,670
<29-5,CASTLE>当真吗  它长啥样
<29-5,CASTLE>Seriously? What's it like?

893
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,300
<29-5,CASTLE>是个幽灵吗  脸色惨白吗  怒火中烧吗
<29-5,CASTLE>Is it, uh, ghastly, pale, pissed?

894
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,200
<29-6,BECKETT>我看不清他的脸
<29-6,BECKETT>I can't get a good look at his face.

895
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,130
<29-6,BECKETT>你家有后门吗
<29-6,BECKETT>Do you have a back door?

896
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,560
<29-7,MARK>有有  穿过厨房就是
<29-7,MARK>Yeah, yeah. Through the kitchen.

897
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,090
<29-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你守着马克
<29-8,BECKETT>Okay, Castle, you keep an eye on Mark.

898
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,370
<29-8,BECKETT>我出去看看
<29-8,BECKETT>I'm gonna head out back,

899
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,830
<29-8,BECKETT>我从后面迂回过去  给他个突然袭击
<29-8,BECKETT>Double around, see if I can surprise him.

900
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,100
<29-9,CASTLE>什么  等一下  我们分头行动
<29-9,CASTLE>What? Wait. We're splitting up?

901
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,850
<29-9,CASTLE>是的
<29-9,CASTLE>Yeah.

902
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,180
<30-1,BECKETT>纽约警察  站在那儿别动
<30-1,BECKETT>NYPD. Hold it right there.

903
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,590
<30-1,BECKETT>他就不能放过我们吗
<30-1,BECKETT>Why can't he just leave us alone?

904
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,870
<30-1,BECKETT>我们已经很倒霉了
<30-1,BECKETT>We suffered so much already.

905
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,880
<31-1,MARK>内疚已经快把我们三个折磨死了
<31-1,MARK>The guilt nearly killed the three of us.

906
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,790
<31-2,CASTLE>你们把那个连环杀手定了罪
<31-2,CASTLE>Why would you have guilt

907
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,730
<31-2,CASTLE>为什么要感到内疚呢
<31-2,CASTLE>about getting a serial killer convicted?

908
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,010
<31-3,MARK>因为那不是事情的全部
<31-3,MARK>Because that's not the whole story.

909
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,260
<31-3,MARK>我们的手上也沾有鲜血
<31-3,MARK>We all have blood on our hands.

910
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,630
<31-4,CASTLE>鲜血  什么鲜血
<31-4,CASTLE>Blood? What blood?

911
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,590
<31-4,CASTLE>马克  跟我说说  我需要知道
<31-4,CASTLE>Mark, talk to me. I need to know.

912
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,290
<31-4,CASTLE>你说的鲜血是什么意思
<31-4,CASTLE>What blood is on your hands?

913
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,440
<31-4,CASTLE>有关系吗
<31-4,CASTLE>What does it matter?

914
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,590
<31-5,MARK>他回来找我们算账了  我们都得死
<31-5,MARK>He's come back for us. We're all gonna die.

915
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,310
<31-6,CASTLE>如果是因为你做错了什么的话
<31-6,CASTLE>It matters because if you did something wrong,

916
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,800
<31-6,CASTLE>这可能就是我们活着出去的关键
<31-6,CASTLE>it could be the key to getting out of this alive.

917
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,440
<32-2,NURSE LOCKHEART>放开我  放开我
<32-2,NURSE LOCKHEART>Get off of me! Let me go!

918
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,710
<32-3,BECKETT>是你  里奥普的护士
<32-3,BECKETT>You? Leopold's nurse.

919
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,520
<32-3,BECKETT>-里奥普  是你干的  -不
<32-3,BECKETT>- Leopold. It was you. - No.

920
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,600
<32-4,NURSE LOCKHEART>不  不是
<32-4,NURSE LOCKHEART>No. No.

921
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,070
<32-5,BECKETT>-是你帮他杀人的  -不  不是的
<32-5,BECKETT>- You're the one that's killing for him. - No,no.

922
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,350
<32-6,NURSE LOCKHEART>你不明白
<32-6,NURSE LOCKHEART>You don't understand.

923
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,910
<32-7,BECKETT>怪不得他能接近那些证人  他是利用你
<32-7,BECKETT>That's how he got to the witnesses. He was using you.

924
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,430
<32-8,NURSE LOCKHEART>你搞错了
<32-8,NURSE LOCKHEART>You don't get it.

925
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,850
<32-8,NURSE LOCKHEART>我不是来这杀海勒的  我是来救他的
<32-8,NURSE LOCKHEART>I'm not here to kill Heller. I'm here to save him.

926
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,280
<32-9,BECKETT>你在说些什么啊
<32-9,BECKETT>What are you even talking about?

927
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,880
<32-10,NURSE LOCKHEART>-这就是里奥普派我来的原因  -退后
<32-10,NURSE LOCKHEART>- That's why Leopold sent me. - Step back.

928
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,840
<32-11,BECKETT>-好的  好的  -退后
<32-11,BECKETT>- Okay.Okay. All right. - Step back.

929
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,990
<32-12,NURSE LOCKHEART>他知道别人会以为他是凶手
<32-12,NURSE LOCKHEART>He knew that people would think that he was behind the murders,

930
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,210
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>那样的话他就永远无法离开精神病院
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>And then he wouldn't be able to get out of the asylum.

931
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,470
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>我爱他  我只是想帮他
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>I love him. I was just trying to protect him.

932
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,910
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>我们知道我们必须得阻止这些谋杀
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>We knew we had to stop the murders.

933
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,880
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>不是我们干的  我发誓
<32-13,NURSE LOCKHEART>It--it's not us. I swear.

934
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,360
<32-14,BECKETT>如果不是你们  那会是谁
<32-14,BECKETT>If it's not you, then who is it?

935
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,220
<32-14,BECKETT>我不知道
<32-14,BECKETT>I don't know,

936
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,090
<32-15,NURSE LOCKHEART>但我去了奈杰尔的坟墓想确认一下
<32-15,NURSE LOCKHEART>but I went to Nigel's grave just to be sure.

937
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,360
<32-15,NURSE LOCKHEART>我把坟墓挖开了  他不见了
<32-15,NURSE LOCKHEART>I dug it up. He was gone.

938
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:40,250
<32-16,BECKETT>不  死人不会杀人
<32-16,BECKETT>No. Evil spirits don't kill.

939
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,040
<32-16,BECKETT>活人才会
<32-16,BECKETT>People do.

940
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,630
<33-1,MARK>在奈杰尔之前  警察还逮捕了别人
<33-1,MARK>Before Nigel, The police arrested someone else--

941
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,170
<33-1,MARK>大卫·克里尔
<33-1,MARK>David Collier.

942
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,390
<33-1,MARK>那人有精神病史
<33-1,MARK>Guy had a history of mental illness.

943
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,250
<33-1,MARK>我  瓦尔和杰森把他指认出来了
<33-1,MARK>Me, Val, and Jason had to pick him out of a lineup.

944
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,830
<33-1,MARK>我们都不确定  但是警察  他们
<33-1,MARK>None of us were sure. But the police, they...

945
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,180
<33-2,CASTLE>他们迫使你们不得不说是克里尔干的
<33-2,CASTLE>They pressured you into saying it was Collier.

946
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,190
<33-2,CASTLE>他后来怎样了
<33-2,CASTLE>What happened to him?

947
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,620
<33-3,MARK>他承受不了那些指控  还有人们的议论
<33-3,MARK>He couldn't take it-- the accusations, what people were saying.

948
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,820
<33-3,MARK>他把牢房里的灯打碎了
<33-3,MARK>He smashed a lightbulb in his cell

949
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,670
<33-3,MARK>然后触电自杀了
<33-3,MARK>and he used the wire to electrocute himself.

950
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,190
<33-4,CASTLE>这么说他心力衰竭而死
<33-4,CASTLE>So his heart stopped.

951
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,890
<33-4,CASTLE>他什么时候死的  马克  准确时间
<33-4,CASTLE>When did he die? Mark, exactly when did he die?

952
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,890
<33-5,MARK>他入狱后第三天的午夜
<33-5,MARK>At midnight, third night he was in prison.

953
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,980
<33-5,MARK>"你看见了  三天后的午夜你就会死"
<33-5,MARK>"You saw. Midnight third day, you die. "

954
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,580
<33-6,CASTLE>跟奈杰尔没关系  是跟克里尔有关
<33-6,CASTLE>This isn't about Nigel. It's about Collier.

955
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,430
<33-6,CASTLE>马克  你得想想
<33-6,CASTLE>Mark, you gotta think.

956
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,230
<33-6,CASTLE>他有没有什么朋友或者家人
<33-6,CASTLE>Did he have any friends, any relatives?

957
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,040
<33-7,MARK>是的  他有一个女儿  阿曼达
<33-7,MARK>Yeah, he had a daughter. Amanda.

958
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,670
<33-8,CASTLE>瓦尔的室友叫阿曼达
<33-8,CASTLE>Val's roommate's name is Amanda.

959
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,050
<33-8,CASTLE>有人来了
<33-8,CASTLE>Someone's here.

960
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,440
<33-9,AMANDA>你三天的时间到了  马克
<33-9,AMANDA>Your three days are up, Mark.

961
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,640
<33-9,AMANDA>我父亲也同样承受了三天的恐惧
<33-9,AMANDA>The same three days of fear my father had.

962
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,460
<33-10,CASTLE>站住  别动
<33-10,CASTLE>Stop... Right there.

963
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,580
<33-11,CASTLE>我看不见了
<33-11,CASTLE>Right in my eyes!

964
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,000
<33-12,MARK>枪  我看不见  她在哪
<33-12,MARK>The gun! I can't see. Where is she?

965
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,320
<33-13,AMANDA>这是为我父亲报仇
<33-13,AMANDA>This is for my father.

966
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,590
<33-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<33-14,BECKETT>Castle!

967
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,960
<33-14,BECKETT>看见了吧
<33-14,BECKETT>See?

968
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,790
<33-15,CASTLE>我就说这瓶圣水会派上用场
<33-15,CASTLE>Told you this holy water would come in handy.

969
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,460
<34-1,BECKETT>根据阿曼达的心理评估记录
<34-1,BECKETT>So according to Amanda's psych records,

970
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,390
<34-1,BECKETT>她一年前经受了一次精神创伤
<34-1,BECKETT>she suffered a mental break about a year ago.

971
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,130
<34-2,CASTLE>她一定是从那时开始准备复仇的
<34-2,CASTLE>That must be when she started fixating on revenge.

972
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,790
<34-2,CASTLE>计划着要惩罚所有错误指认了他父亲的人
<34-2,CASTLE>Plannign to punish all those who wrongly I.D.'ed her dad.

973
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,330
<34-3,BECKETT>她一定是拼命讨好瓦尔
<34-3,BECKETT>You know, she must have cozied up to Val

974
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,930
<34-3,BECKETT>从而找到了杰森和马克
<34-3,BECKETT>to find out where Jason and Mark were.

975
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,940
<34-4,ESPOSITO>还有  她用这个把他们撂倒了
<34-4,ESPOSITO>And... she used this to knock them out.

976
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,130
<34-5,CASTLE>杯子
<34-5,CASTLE>The mug?

977
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,220
<34-6,ESPOSITO>不  是电击枪  改造过了
<34-6,ESPOSITO>No, the taser. It's a modified taser.

978
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,880
<34-6,ESPOSITO>它能释放出令人眩晕的光线和加大的电压
<34-6,ESPOSITO>It emits a disorienting light and amplified voltage.

979
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,620
<34-7,BECKETT>足以使心脏停止跳动的电压
<34-7,BECKETT>Enough voltage to stop a heart.

980
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,520
<34-8,ESPOSITO>而且还能使面部肌肉收缩
<34-8,ESPOSITO>And make the facial muscles contract.

981
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,230
<34-9,CASTLE>我想阿曼达是想要那些对他父亲的死
<34-9,CASTLE>I guess Amanda wanted the people responsible For her father's death

982
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,950
<34-9,CASTLE>负有责任的人承受和他父亲一样的痛苦
<34-9,CASTLE>to suffer the same way he did.

983
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,900
<34-10,BECKETT>也就是三天的恐惧
<34-10,BECKETT>So three days of fear

984
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,750
<34-10,BECKETT>最后在黑暗中  心脏停跳而死去
<34-10,BECKETT>capped up with a dark, heart-stopping death.

985
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,240
<34-11,ESPOSITO>但是她是怎么造成停电的呢
<34-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but how did she get the power to go out?

986
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,530
<34-11,ESPOSITO>她用的这个
<34-11,ESPOSITO>She used this.

987
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,780
<34-12,BECKETT>她把这个连在小屋的断路器上
<34-12,BECKETT>She attached it to the cabin's circuit breaker.

988
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,590
<34-12,BECKETT>它释放出的磁荷
<34-12,BECKETT>It emits a magnetic charge

989
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,700
<34-12,BECKETT>影响了电路系统
<34-12,BECKETT>that interferes with the system.

990
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,230
<34-12,BECKETT>所以说  所有的事都有合乎逻辑的解释
<34-12,BECKETT>So... I guess that there is a logical explanation for everything.

991
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,790
<34-13,CASTLE>说不好  奈杰尔的事怎么说
<34-13,CASTLE>Oh,I don't know. What about Nigel?

992
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,770
<34-13,CASTLE>他的尸体怎么会从坟墓里不见了呢
<34-13,CASTLE>How did his body go missing from his grave?

993
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,930
<34-14,RYAN>我来回答吧
<34-14,RYAN>I can answer that.

994
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,100
<34-14,RYAN>原来他从没被下葬
<34-14,RYAN>Turns out he was never buried.

995
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,480
<34-14,RYAN>他的尸体在他死后不久就从太平间消失了
<34-14,RYAN>His body disappeared from the morgue shortly after his death.

996
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,190
<34-14,RYAN>警察不想让别人知道
<34-14,RYAN>The police didn't want to make it known,

997
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,300
<34-14,RYAN>所以就埋了一个空棺材
<34-14,RYAN>So they buried an empty coffin.

998
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,940
<34-14,RYAN>但奇怪的是  他的尸体一直没被找到
<34-14,RYAN>But here's the odd thing-- his body was never found.

999
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,470
<34-15,CASTLE>这么说  他可能仍然在
<34-15,CASTLE>So... he could still be out there...

1000
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,000
<34-15,CASTLE>某个地方
<34-15,CASTLE>somewhere.

1001
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,570
<35-1,BECKETT>这杯庆祝我们出色地完成了任务
<35-1,BECKETT>Okay,so... here's to a job well done.

1002
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,240
<35-1,BECKETT>你现在终于可以扔掉你的这份
<35-1,BECKETT>And now you can finally get rid of this bucket... list

1003
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,830
<35-1,BECKETT>遗愿清单了
<35-1,BECKETT>of yours.

1004
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,440
<35-2,CASTLE>怎么这个表情
<35-2,CASTLE>What's that look for?

1005
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,400
<35-3,BECKETT>"跟凯特在一起"
<35-3,BECKETT>"Be with Kate"?

1006
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,310
<35-3,BECKETT>排在第一个  你什么时候写的
<35-3,BECKETT>That's your number one? When did you write this?

1007
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,960
<35-4,CASTLE>差不多三年前吧
<35-4,CASTLE>What, like three years ago?

1008
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,200
<35-4,CASTLE>现在我可以把这条划去了
<35-4,CASTLE>I can cross that one off.

1009
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,650
<35-5,CASTLE>抱歉  还有一分钟才到午夜
<35-5,CASTLE>Sorry. Still one minute till midnight.

1010
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,040
<35-6,BECKETT>你没搞错吧  卡塞尔
<35-6,BECKETT>Are you serious, Castle?

1011
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,360
<35-7,CASTLE>没有  我认真的  我可不想冒险
<35-7,CASTLE>Yes, I'm serious. I'm not taking any chances.

1012
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,580
<35-7,CASTLE>我真的很想错过这个死期
<35-7,CASTLE>This is one deadline I want to miss.

1013
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:46,470
<35-7,CASTLE>你说的对
<35-7,CASTLE>You know, you're right.

1014
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,690
<35-8,BECKETT>要是我们俩有什么三长两短真的很遗憾
<35-8,BECKETT>It would be a shame if something happened to us

1015
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:51,190
<35-8,BECKETT>因为我的遗愿清单上也有一件
<35-8,BECKETT>because there's one thing on my bucket list

1016
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,040
<35-8,BECKETT>我很想完成的事
<35-8,BECKETT>that I would like to accomplish.

1017
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,620
<35-8,BECKETT>而且这事还跟我玩弄冰块
<35-8,BECKETT>And it involves a little trick that I do...

1018
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,890
<35-8,BECKETT>有关
<35-8,BECKETT>with ice.

1019
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,370
<35-9,CASTLE>你看  就冲这事儿我们也得活着
<35-9,CASTLE>See, now that definitely sounds worth living for.

1020
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,450
<35-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  冰块可要化了哦
<35-10,BECKETT>Hey, Castle... the ice is melting.

1021
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,840
<35-11,CASTLE>好的  就  倒计时
<35-11,CASTLE>Okay, ju--I just-- In...

1022
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,560
<35-11,CASTLE>三  二
<35-11,CASTLE>three, two...
