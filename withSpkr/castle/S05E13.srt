25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,340
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>你为什么这么确定
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>So what makes you so sure

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,710
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>阿丽克西斯对这个男生不是认真的
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>that Alexis isn't serious about this guy?

27
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,460
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>我没见过他  也没认可他
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Well, I haven't met him or approved of him yet

28
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,430
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>所以必须不是认真的
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>so it can't be serious.

29
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,700
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>所有追求者必须
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>All suitors must be

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,380
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>由我亲自见过并恐吓一番
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>met and intimidated by me personally

31
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,830
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>才有可能成为正式男友
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>before they can be considered for official boyfriend status.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
<1-3,LANIE PARISH>是我就不会那样做
<1-3,LANIE PARISH>I would not do that.

33
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,290
<1-4,LANIE>她的尸体之前在那个桶里
<1-4,LANIE>Her body was in that barrel over there,

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,760
<1-4,LANIE>被焚烧过了  面目全非
<1-4,LANIE>Burned, and I mean beyond recognition.

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,350
<1-5,BECKETT>有没有可能确认身份
<1-5,BECKETT>Any chance of a positive I.D.?

36
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,560
<1-6,LANIE>指纹是不可能了
<1-6,LANIE>Not from fingerprints.

37
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,070
<1-6,LANIE>从骨架可以看出是名年轻女性
<1-6,LANIE>But bone structure tells me it's a young woman,

38
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,040
<1-6,LANIE>大约1米62
<1-6,LANIE>About 5'4".

39
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,540
<1-7,CASTLE>外来游客吗
<1-7,CASTLE>So a transient?

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,130
<1-8,LANIE>不太像  她的后脑中枪
<1-8,LANIE>I doubt it. There's a bullet hole in the back of her head

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,720
<1-8,LANIE>还有她的牙齿
<1-8,LANIE>and then there's her teeth.

42
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,220
<1-8,LANIE>全被拔掉了
<1-8,LANIE>Every one of them was knocked out of her mouth.

43
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,670
<1-9,CASTLE>牙齿记录也查不到了
<1-9,CASTLE>So much for dental records.

44
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,770
<1-10,BECKETT>显然有人费尽心思
<1-10,BECKETT>Well, someone obviously went to great lengths

45
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,190
<1-10,BECKETT>确保她消失
<1-10,BECKETT>to make sure she disappeared.

46
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,600
<1-11,KEVIN RYAN>没有人看到任何情况
<1-11,KEVIN RYAN>So... none of these guys saw anything.

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,920
<1-11,KEVIN RYAN>他们白天行乞
<1-11,KEVIN RYAN>They panhandle by day.

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,650
<1-11,KEVIN RYAN>到天黑才会回来
<1-11,KEVIN RYAN>Don't come back here till it's dark.

49
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:51,820
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>第一个来这里的人说
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>The first guy who showed up said

50
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,050
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>当时已经着火了
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>the fire was already going.

51
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,420
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>听起来像是弃尸
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Sounds like a dump job.

52
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,600
<1-13,BECKETT>好吧  被害人是女性
<1-13,BECKETT>All right. We have a female.

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,760
<1-13,BECKETT>身高1米62  去查查失踪人口记录
<1-13,BECKETT>She's 5'4". Let's start looking through missing persons reports.

54
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,790
<1-14,LANIE>等等
<1-14,LANIE>Wait.

55
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,670
<1-14,LANIE>也许没必要这样做
<1-14,LANIE>You may not have to do that.

56
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,990
<1-14,LANIE>下颚处有个钛合金螺丝
<1-14,LANIE>A titanium screw from her jaw.

57
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,230
<1-15,CASTLE>牙移植
<1-15,CASTLE>Dental implant.

58
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,660
<1-16,LANIE>这上面有批号
<1-16,LANIE>And there's a batch number,

59
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,690
<1-16,LANIE>有可能会查出名字
<1-16,LANIE>which could give us her name.

60
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,610
<2-1,RYAN>根据牙科记录查到死者是梅兰妮·罗杰斯  27岁
<2-1,RYAN>We traced that dental screw to Melanie Rogers, 27.

61
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,980
<2-1,RYAN>住在新泽西罗格斯大学附近
<2-1,RYAN>Lived in New Jersey near Rutgers University,

62
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,420
<2-1,RYAN>她是博士后工程师  专攻环保化设计
<2-1,RYAN>where she was a postdoc engineer in eco-friendly design.

63
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,750
<2-1,RYAN>大家都说  她受人欢迎  尊敬
<2-1,RYAN>By all accounts, she was well-liked, respected.

64
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,990
<2-1,RYAN>我调查的人中  都想不出谁会对她下毒手
<2-1,RYAN>No one I spoke to had any idea who could've done this to her.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
<2-2,CASTLE>新泽西的工程师怎么会
<2-2,CASTLE>What's an engineer from New Jersey

66
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,560
<2-2,CASTLE>被弃尸在曼哈顿贫民区的桶里
<2-2,CASTLE>doing in a barrel in lower Manhattan?

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,540
<2-3,ESPOSITO>不知道  但她肯定碰到了什么麻烦
<2-3,ESPOSITO>I don't know, but something was going on with her.

68
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,600
<2-3,ESPOSITO>我调出了她昨天的电话记录
<2-3,ESPOSITO>I pulled her phone records for yesterday.

69
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,830
<2-3,ESPOSITO>她在20分钟内  给同一个号码
<2-3,ESPOSITO>She made a half a dozen calls to the same number

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,960
<2-3,ESPOSITO>打了六通电话
<2-3,ESPOSITO>in a 20-minute period.

71
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,330
<2-5,ESPOSITO>-男朋友吗  -有可能
<2-5,ESPOSITO>- Boyfriend? - Could be.

72
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,390
<2-5,ESPOSITO>区号是202  但是具体信息被屏蔽了
<2-5,ESPOSITO>It's a 2-0-2 number, but it's listed as blocked.

73
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,310
<2-6,CASTLE>202  那是华盛顿特区
<2-6,CASTLE>2-0-2. Uh, that's Washington, D.C.

74
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,700
<2-7,ESPOSITO>对  初步调查对方是手机
<2-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Preliminary check shows it's a cell phone.

75
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,500
<2-8,BECKETT>这意味着电话的主人有可能就在这里
<2-8,BECKETT>Which means whoever it is might be in the city.

76
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,010
<2-8,BECKETT>去申请调查这个号码的许可令
<2-8,BECKETT>Let's get a warrant on that phone number.

77
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,620
<2-9,ESPOSITO>大约下午四点  她又打了一通电话
<2-9,ESPOSITO>She made one other call after that, around 4:00 P.M.

78
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,750
<2-9,ESPOSITO>那之后  电话就没有记录了
<2-9,ESPOSITO>And then after that, all her phone activity went dark.

79
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,800
<2-10,BECKETT>她打给谁的
<2-10,BECKETT>Who was the call to?

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,330
<2-11,ESPOSITO>她同父异母的姐妹朱莉
<2-11,ESPOSITO>It was to her half sister Julie.

81
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,900
<2-11,ESPOSITO>我查了下  这是她的唯一亲人
<2-11,ESPOSITO>I took a look. She's her only family.

82
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,600
<2-11,ESPOSITO>她是市中心的信贷员
<2-11,ESPOSITO>She works as a loan officer in midtown.

83
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,790
<2-12,BECKETT>带她来问话  可能会有线索
<2-12,BECKETT>Bring her in. She might be able to shed some light.

84
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,610
<3-1,JULIE>梅兰妮和我并不亲近
<3-1,JULIE>Melanie and I were never all that close.

85
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,980
<3-1,JULIE>但我们的父亲生病后
<3-1,JULIE>But when our dad got sick, we, um...

86
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,380
<3-1,JULIE>我们才真正了解彼此
<3-1,JULIE>We found each other.

87
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,330
<3-2,CASTLE>你知不知道
<3-2,CASTLE>Do you have any idea

88
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,800
<3-2,CASTLE>你姐姐昨天来市里做什么
<3-2,CASTLE>what your sister was doing in the city yesterday?

89
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,310
<3-3,JULIE>不知道  她偶尔会来
<3-3,JULIE>No. She came in from time to time.

90
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,390
<3-4,BECKETT>你知道她最近有和谁约会吗
<3-4,BECKETT>Do you know if she was dating anyone recently?

91
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,280
<3-5,CASTLE>或许是华盛顿的人
<3-5,CASTLE>Someone from D.C. perhaps?

92
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,930
<3-6,JULIE>我不太清楚
<3-6,JULIE>Not that I knew about.

93
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
<3-6,JULIE>不过
<3-6,JULIE>Although...

94
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,330
<3-6,JULIE>两天前  我们一起吃晚餐
<3-6,JULIE>Just two nights ago, she met me for dinner.

95
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,900
<3-6,JULIE>她提到稍后会去见一个朋友
<3-6,JULIE>She mentioned meeting a friend afterwards.

96
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
<3-7,CASTLE>她有说是谁吗
<3-7,CASTLE>Did she say who?

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,690
<3-8,JULIE>我问了
<3-8,JULIE>Well, I asked,

98
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,950
<3-8,JULIE>但她说出于某些原因不能说
<3-8,JULIE>but she said she couldn't talk about it for some reason.

99
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,280
<3-9,BECKETT>那你昨天和她通电话时
<3-9,BECKETT>So when you spoke with her yesterday,

100
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,150
<3-9,BECKETT>有没有觉得有些不对劲
<3-9,BECKETT>did it sound like anything was wrong?

101
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,510
<3-10,JULIE>我昨天没和她通电话
<3-10,JULIE>I never spoke to her yesterday.

102
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,740
<3-11,CASTLE>她的电话记录显示昨天四点打给你了
<3-11,CASTLE>Her phone records indicate she called you about 4:00.

103
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,410
<3-11,CASTLE>四点吗
<3-11,CASTLE>4:00?

104
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,130
<3-12,JULIE>不  我当时在开会
<3-12,JULIE>N-no. I was in a meeting.

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,600
<3-12,JULIE>我的天
<3-12,JULIE>Oh, my god.

106
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,680
<3-12,JULIE>她留了条口信
<3-12,JULIE>She left a message.

107
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,700
<4-1,MELANIE>是我  听着  我觉得出事了
<4-1,MELANIE>It's me. Listen, I think something's going on.

108
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,610
<4-1,MELANIE>有些事不太对劲
<4-1,MELANIE>Something's not right.

109
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,270
<4-1,MELANIE>我敢肯定有人要对我不利
<4-1,MELANIE>I'm pretty sure someone's after me.

110
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,870
<4-2,BECKETT>她在停车场
<4-2,BECKETT>She's in a parking structure.

111
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,510
<4-3,CASTLE>有两组脚步声
<4-3,CASTLE>You can hear two sets of footsteps.

112
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,680
<4-5,MELANIE>如果我有不测  跟他们说XT3
<4-5,MELANIE>If anything happens, tell them X-T-3--

113
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,140
<4-6,TECH>就这样了
<4-6,TECH>That's it.

114
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,220
<4-7,BECKETT>她录下了自己的凶杀案
<4-7,BECKETT>She recorded her own murder.

115
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,830
<4-8,CASTLE>停车场  字母和数字
<4-8,CASTLE>Okay, parking structure, letters and numbers.

116
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,420
<4-8,CASTLE>听起来像是在念车牌
<4-8,CASTLE>Sounds like she's reading off a license plate.

117
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,150
<4-9,BECKETT>跟踪她的人的车牌
<4-9,BECKETT>Of the guy that was following her.

118
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,730
<4-9,BECKETT>包含XT3的车牌有千千万
<4-9,BECKETT>And X-T-3, I mean, there's gonna be thousands of plates with that partial.

119
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,840
<4-9,BECKETT>能再放一遍最后一段吗
<4-9,BECKETT>Can you play the end again?

120
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,050
<4-9,BECKETT>手机掉地之后好像还有声音
<4-9,BECKETT>I thought I heard something after the phone hit the ground.

121
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,910
<4-10,MELANIE>如果我有不测  跟他们说XT3
<4-10,MELANIE>If anything happens, tell them X-T-3--

122
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
<4-11,BECKETT>就这里  听到了吗
<4-11,BECKETT>There. Did you hear that?

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
<4-11,BECKETT>是咔嗒声
<4-11,BECKETT>There's a click.

124
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,230
<4-12,TECH>我处理一下
<4-12,TECH>Let me see what I can do with that.

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,600
<4-13,CASTLE>是打火机
<4-13,CASTLE>It's a lighter.

126
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,910
<4-13,CASTLE>芝宝打火机
<4-13,CASTLE>That's a Zippo lighter.

127
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,430
<4-13,CASTLE>他杀了梅兰妮
<4-13,CASTLE>So he killed Melanie

128
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,910
<4-13,CASTLE>然后停下点了根烟
<4-13,CASTLE>and then stopped to have a cigarette.

129
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,810
<4-14,BECKETT>也就是说嫌犯也许是个精神病
<4-14,BECKETT>Which means we might be dealing with a psychopath.

130
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,250
<4-15,RYAN>那个华盛顿号码
<4-15,RYAN>So that D.C. number?

131
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,870
<4-15,RYAN>看来机主在城里
<4-15,RYAN>Looks like whoever owns it was in town.

132
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
<4-15,RYAN>那天她跟妹妹吃完晚餐
<4-15,RYAN>She called it the other night

133
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,400
<4-15,RYAN>马上就打了这个号码
<4-15,RYAN>right after dinner with her sister.

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,850
<4-16,CASTLE>就是她说要去见个人那会儿
<4-16,CASTLE>When she said she was meeting someone.

135
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,600
<4-16,CASTLE>没错
<4-16,CASTLE>Yeah, that's right.

136
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,510
<4-17,RYAN>信用卡记录显示
<4-17,RYAN>Credit card record says that

137
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,420
<4-17,RYAN>她几分钟后就上了的士
<4-17,RYAN>she was in a cab just a few minutes later.

138
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,630
<4-17,RYAN>我查到了的士司机  他说晚上十一点
<4-17,RYAN>I tracked down the driver. Said he dropped her off

139
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,360
<4-17,RYAN>送她去了斯坦宾馆
<4-17,RYAN>at the Standish Hotel at 11:00 p.m.

140
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,990
<4-18,CASTLE>也许她去幽会那位华盛顿朋友了
<4-18,CASTLE>Perhaps she was meeting her Washington friend for a secret tryst?

141
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,970
<4-19,RYAN>说得通
<4-19,RYAN>It makes sense.

142
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,200
<4-19,RYAN>谨慎的已婚男士都喜欢去斯坦
<4-19,RYAN>The Standish is popular with married men who value discretion.

143
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,410
<4-20,CASTLE>也许酒店里有人看到他们在一起了
<4-20,CASTLE>Maybe someone at the hotel saw her with him.

144
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,640
<5-1,CONCIERGE>我真不确定
<5-1,CONCIERGE>I'm really not sure.

145
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,400
<5-1,CONCIERGE>每天那么多人来来往往
<5-1,CONCIERGE>Uh, so many people come through here everyday.

146
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,450
<5-2,BECKETT>再看清楚点
<5-2,BECKETT>Look again.

147
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,590
<5-2,BECKETT>记住  这是凶杀案调查
<5-2,BECKETT>And keep in mind, this is a murder investigation.

148
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,550
<5-3,CONCIERGE>我也许见过她几次
<5-3,CONCIERGE>I might have seen her a few times.

149
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,400
<5-4,BECKETT>两天前那个晚上呢
<5-4,BECKETT>What about two nights ago?

150
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,620
<5-5,CONCIERGE>可能见过吧
<5-5,CONCIERGE>Yes. Probably.

151
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,350
<5-6,CASTLE>有人跟她一起吗
<5-6,CASTLE>Was she meeting someone?

152
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,270
<5-7,BECKETT>告诉我是谁
<5-7,BECKETT>I'm gonna need a name.

153
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,480
<5-8,CONCIERGE>我们的客户很重视隐私
<5-8,CONCIERGE>Look, our clients value their privacy.

154
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,000
<5-8,CONCIERGE>你这样让我处境很尴尬
<5-8,CONCIERGE>You're really putting me in an awkward position here.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
<5-9,BECKET>你觉得这样就尴尬了
<5-9,BECKET>Oh, you think this is awkward?

156
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,740
<5-9,BECKET>等我拿授权令来
<5-9,BECKET>Wait till I get a warrant

157
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,060
<5-9,BECKET>审问过去一年里所有
<5-9,BECKET>and start questioning all the people that have stayed here

158
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,810
<5-9,BECKET>住过这里的人
<5-9,BECKET>over the past year.

159
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,810
<5-10,CONCIERGE>好吧
<5-10,CONCIERGE>Fine.

160
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,140
<5-10,CONCIERGE>不是我告诉你们的
<5-10,CONCIERGE>You didn't hear it from me.

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,190
<5-11,BECKETT>不会吧
<5-11,BECKETT>It can't be.

162
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,960
<5-11,BECKETT>梅兰妮在跟布莱肯参议员偷情
<5-11,BECKETT>Melanie was having an affair with Senator Bracken.

172
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,190
<6-1,BECKETT>没错了  埃斯波西托证实了
<6-1,BECKETT>That's it. Esposito's confirmed it.

173
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,580
<6-1,BECKETT>梅兰妮打的那个号码
<6-1,BECKETT>The number that Melanie was calling

174
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,930
<6-1,BECKETT>是布莱肯参议员的手机号
<6-1,BECKETT>was Senator Bracken's cell phone.

175
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,290
<6-2,CASTLE>半夜三更的电话  酒店秘密私会
<6-2,CASTLE>Late-night phone calls, secret hotel meetings--

176
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,860
<6-2,CASTLE>布莱肯在跟梅兰妮偷情
<6-2,CASTLE>Bracken was having an affair with Melanie.

177
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,430
<6-2,CASTLE>她肯定成了他的累赘
<6-2,CASTLE>She must have become a liability.

178
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,040
<6-3,BECKETT>要不然就是无意中发现他的丑事
<6-3,BECKETT>Or she stumbled on to something that he was involved in

179
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,250
<6-3,BECKETT>对他构成威胁
<6-3,BECKETT>and became a threat.

180
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,230
<6-4,CASTLE>于是他就用对付你母亲
<6-4,CASTLE>So he dealt with her

181
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,320
<6-4,CASTLE>和打算对付你的方式
<6-4,CASTLE>the same way he dealt with your mother

182
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,620
<6-4,CASTLE>解决了她
<6-4,CASTLE>and tried to deal with you.

183
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,990
<6-5,BECKETT>时机到了  卡塞尔
<6-5,BECKETT>This is it, Castle.

184
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,390
<6-5,BECKETT>我终于有机会让他付出代价了
<6-5,BECKETT>This is my chance to finally make him pay.

185
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,260
<6-6,CASTLE>是的  但我们得小心处理
<6-6,CASTLE>Yeah, but we have to be cautious.

186
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,040
<6-6,CASTLE>我们都知道追查他的人有什么下场
<6-6,CASTLE>We know what happens to people who go after him.

187
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,240
<6-7,BECKETT>但这次  他还不知道我们查到他身上了
<6-7,BECKETT>Except this time, he doesn't know we're on to him.

188
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,820
<6-7,BECKETT>我们可以先发制人
<6-7,BECKETT>We've got the advantage here.

189
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,550
<6-8,CASTLE>是吗
<6-8,CASTLE>Do we?

190
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,650
<6-8,CASTLE>如果他知道你要对付他  他会做出什么来
<6-8,CASTLE>What do you think he's gonna do when he sees you coming?

191
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,730
<7-1,ESPOSITO>你觉得他害死了多少人才爬到
<7-1,ESPOSITO>How many people you think this bastard put in the ground

192
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,650
<7-1,ESPOSITO>现在的位置
<7-1,ESPOSITO>to get here?

193
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,740
<7-2,RYAN>记住  我们只是来
<7-2,RYAN>Hey, remember, we're only here

194
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,410
<7-2,RYAN>问他梅兰妮去过哪些地方的
<7-2,RYAN>to see if he can help us locate Melanie.

195
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,460
<7-3,ESPOSITO>我知道
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,770
<7-3,ESPOSITO>让他觉得这次也能如平时一样
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Let him think he got away with it,

197
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,390
<7-3,ESPOSITO>逃脱法律的制裁
<7-3,ESPOSITO>just like he does everything else.

198
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,850
<7-3,ESPOSITO>我真希望下次与他碰面时
<7-3,ESPOSITO>You know, I was really hoping the next time I saw this guy

199
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,450
<7-3,ESPOSITO>是我用枪指着他
<7-3,ESPOSITO>it would be down the barrel of my gun.

200
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,000
<7-3,ESPOSITO>你真的不肯改变心意吗
<7-3,ESPOSITO>You're sure I can't change your mind?

201
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,520
<8-1,BENJAMIN MOSS>我这次真需要你帮忙  比尔
<8-1,BENJAMIN MOSS>I could really use your help on this one, Bill.

<8-2,SENATOR WILLIAM BRACKEN>You also know how important this legislation is to me.

<8-2,SENATOR WILLIAM BRACKEN>参议员
<8-2,SENATOR WILLIAM BRACKEN>Senator.

<8-3,BUTLER>Some detectives are here to see you.

206
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,620
<8-4,RYAN>抱歉打扰  参议员
<8-4,RYAN>Sorry to trouble you, senator.

207
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,220
<8-4,RYAN>不需要很久的
<8-4,RYAN>This won't take long.

208
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,010
<8-5,SHIELA BRACKEN>怎么了  比尔
<8-5,SHIELA BRACKEN>What's this about, Bill?

209
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,240
<8-6,BRACKEN>我也不清楚
<8-6,BRACKEN>I'm not sure.

212
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,140
<8-7,RYAN>应该没有  先生
<8-7,RYAN>I don't think so, sir.

213
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,090
<8-7,RYAN>有地方让我们私下谈谈吗
<8-7,RYAN>Is there someplace we can talk?

214
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,120
<9-1,BRACKEN>我很想给你俩倒杯酒
<9-1,BRACKEN>I'd offer you both a drink,

215
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,210
<9-1,BRACKEN>不过我感觉你们是为公务而来
<9-1,BRACKEN>but I get the feeling this is an official call.

216
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,570
<9-2,RYAN>我们只是想就某个人问你几个问题
<9-2,RYAN>Well, we'd just like to ask you a few questions about someone.

217
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,580
<9-2,RYAN>梅兰妮·罗杰斯

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,530
<9-15,BRACKEN>你在暗示什么

244
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,270
<9-17,BRACKEN>想要诬陷我
<9-17,BRACKEN>and use it against me.

<9-21,BRACKEN>Then call my lawyer.

250
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,180
<10-1,ESPOSITO>这家伙肯定有罪
<10-1,ESPOSITO>The guy's guilty as hell,

251
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,170
<10-1,ESPOSITO>但他有不在场证明
<10-1,ESPOSITO>but he has an alibi.

252
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,090
<10-1,ESPOSITO>他整天都在参加会议
<10-1,ESPOSITO>He was at some conference all day.

<10-1,ESPOSITO>莱恩正在核查
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Ryan's checking it out now.

<10-2,BECKETT>会被确实的
<10-2,BECKETT>It's gonna check out.

255
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,990
<10-2,BECKETT>他从不自己出手
<10-2,BECKETT>He never does this on his own.

256
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,410
<10-2,BECKETT>都是派别人去
<10-2,BECKETT>He always sends someone else.

257
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,920
<10-3,CASTLE>好吧  那么...
<10-3,CASTLE>Okay, okay, so...

258
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,050
<10-3,CASTLE>我们不仅得找出凶手
<10-3,CASTLE>Now not only do we have to find this killer,

259
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,530
<10-3,CASTLE>还得找到他跟布莱肯的关系
<10-3,CASTLE>but we have to connect him to Bracken.

260
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,170
<10-4,ESPOSITO>只是我们毫无头绪从何下手
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Except we have no idea where to start looking.

261
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,380
<10-4,ESPOSITO>我们连犯罪现场都没找到
<10-4,ESPOSITO>We don't even have a real crime scene.

262
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,940
<10-5,BECKETT>的确  但我们有进展了
<10-5,BECKETT>No, but we're getting closer.

263
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,740
<10-5,BECKETT>联调局分析了梅兰妮的语言留言
<10-5,BECKETT>The FBI performed an analysis of Melanie's voice mail.

264
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,700
<10-5,BECKETT>这通电话来自一个停车场
<10-5,BECKETT>It was a call made from a parking garage

265
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,870
<10-5,BECKETT>她在那里被绑架的
<10-5,BECKETT>where she was abducted.

266
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,330
<10-6,CASTLE>他们分析出背景噪音是来自
<10-6,CASTLE>They identified the background noise

267
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,730
<10-6,CASTLE>TC5015塔式起重机的液压发动机
<10-6,CASTLE>as the hydraulic motor of a TC5015 tower crane.

268
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,370
<10-7,ESPOSITO>塔式起重机常用于大型工程
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Tower cranes are used in heavy construction.

269
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,210
<10-8,CASTLE>也就是说车库靠近一个建筑工地
<10-8,CASTLE>Which means the garage is near a construction site.

270
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,560
<10-8,CASTLE>市里只有12所工地
<10-8,CASTLE>And only 12 sites in the city...

271
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,200
<10-8,CASTLE>在用这个型号的起重机
<10-8,CASTLE>are currently using that crane.

272
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,570
<10-9,RYAN>布莱肯的不在场证明核实了
<10-9,RYAN>Hey. So Bracken's alibi checked out.

273
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,700
<10-9,RYAN>目击者称他昨天全天下午都有列席
<10-9,RYAN>Witnesses put him at the Goldman ecological conference

274
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,980
<10-9,RYAN>古德曼环境会议
<10-9,RYAN>all afternoon yesterday.

275
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,750
<10-9,RYAN>他们同时确认梅兰妮也在
<10-9,RYAN>They also confirmed that Melanie was there,

276
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,750
<10-9,RYAN>正如他所说
<10-9,RYAN>just like he said.

277
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,260
<10-9,RYAN>她于3点45离开
<10-9,RYAN>She was seen leaving at 3:45.

278
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,130
<10-10,BECKETT>梅兰妮在停车场留言的时间是4点钟
<10-10,BECKETT>Melanie left the voice mail from the parking garage at 4:00.

279
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,940
<10-11,CASTLE>会议的举办地在哪里
<10-11,CASTLE>Where was that conference being held?

280
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,320
<10-12,RYAN>市中心的韦德马克宾馆
<10-12,RYAN>At the Widmark hotel downtown.

281
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,310
<10-13,CASTLE>韦德马克  五个街区至外地刚好有个建筑工地
<10-13,CASTLE>The Widmark--that's five blocks from that construction site.

282
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,060
<10-14,BECKETT>旁边刚好有个停车场
<10-14,BECKETT>Which is right next to a parking garage.

283
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,800
<11-1,RYAN>贝克特
<11-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett.

284
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,320
<11-1,RYAN>你得过来看看
<11-1,RYAN>You need to see this.

285
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,320
<11-1,RYAN>XT3
<11-1,RYAN>X-T-3.

286
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,980
<11-2,RYAN>正如梅兰妮留言所说
<11-2,RYAN>Just like in Melanie's voice mail.

287
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,180
<11-3,BECKETT>查了车牌吗
<11-3,BECKETT>Did you run the plates?

288
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,400
<11-4,RYAN>查了  是被偷车牌  四天前报的案
<11-4,RYAN>Yeah. Just came back stolen. Reported four days ago.

289
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,500
<11-5,BECKETT>好  你们检查下车内
<11-5,BECKETT>All right. You guys check inside.

290
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,720
<11-5,BECKETT>埃斯波  把后车厢打开
<11-5,BECKETT>Espo, pop that trunk.

291
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,790
<11-6,CASTLE>我可能说的不准
<11-6,CASTLE>I may be wrong,

292
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,320
<11-6,CASTLE>但这看起来像把狙击步枪
<11-6,CASTLE>but that looks like a sniper rifle.

293
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,600
<11-7,RYAN>你不会错的
<11-7,RYAN>You wouldn't be wrong.

294
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,460
<11-8,ESPOSITO>看  韦德马克宾馆  就是会议所在地
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Yo. Widmark hotel. That's where that conference is.

295
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,010
<11-9,RYAN>布莱肯不是说他过几天要在那演讲吗
<11-9,RYAN>Didn't Bracken say he was giving a speech there in a couple of days?

297
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,060
<11-11,BECKETT>我觉得布莱肯不是凶手
<11-11,BECKETT>I don't think Bracken's our killer.

299
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,970
<11-12,CASTLE>他不是
<11-12,CASTLE>He isn't.

300
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,810
<11-13,CASTLE>他是击杀目标
<11-13,CASTLE>He's the target.

301
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,880
<12-1,BECKETT>根据我们在车里发现的证物
<12-1,BECKETT>Based on what we found in the car,

302
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,260
<12-1,BECKETT>有人计划在明晚的环境会议上
<12-1,BECKETT>someone was planning on shooting the senator

303
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,860
<12-1,BECKETT>趁议员做主题演讲之时
<12-1,BECKETT>at the eco conference tomorrow night

304
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,850
<12-1,BECKETT>将其射杀
<12-1,BECKETT>while he delivers his keynote speech.

305
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,020
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>如果疑犯仍未落网
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>And if our suspect is still out there,

306
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,310
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>他仍旧构成威胁
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>he's still a threat.

307
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,320
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>行李袋上有提取到指纹吗
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Did we get any prints off that duffel bag?

308
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,120
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>尚未  长官
<12-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Uh, not yet, sir.

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,310
<12-3,BECKETT>鉴证组还在检查汽车  笔记本
<12-3,BECKETT>C.S.U. is still dusting the car, the notebook,

310
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,320
<12-3,BECKETT>和包内的其他物品
<12-3,BECKETT>and everything else in the bag,

311
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,620
<12-3,BECKETT>包括狙击步枪
<12-3,BECKETT>including the rifle.

312
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,630
<12-3,BECKETT>但是狙击步枪上有序列号
<12-3,BECKETT>Now we have serial numbers on the rifle,

313
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,910
<12-3,BECKETT>我们正在调查
<12-3,BECKETT>and we're looking into those.

314
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,070
<12-4,GATES>被害人呢
<12-4,GATES>And our victim?

315
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,330
<12-4,GATES>梅兰妮·罗杰斯是怎么卷进来的
<12-4,GATES>How did Melanie Rogers get mixed up in this?

316
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,930
<12-5,CASTLE>她不知怎么撞破了他的计划  被他杀害了
<12-5,CASTLE>Somehow she stumbled upon his plot, and he killed her.

317
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,110
<12-6,GATES>不好意思
<12-6,GATES>Oh, excuse me.

318
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,830
<12-6,GATES>市长找我
<12-6,GATES>It's the mayor.

319
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,350
<12-6,GATES>有情况向我报告
<12-6,GATES>Keep me posted. Mm-hmm.

320
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,100
<12-8,RYAN>我们或许有潜在凶犯的相貌描述了
<12-8,RYAN>We might have a description of our potential shooter.

321
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
<12-8,RYAN>韦德马克的保安拦下过
<12-8,RYAN>Widmark security stopped someone from

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,980
<12-8,RYAN>一个企图无证进入会议现场的人
<12-8,RYAN>getting into the conference without proper credentials.

<12-12,RYAN>他们说是在下午3点45分左右
<12-12,RYAN>They said it was about 3:45 P.M.

329
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,950
<12-13,CASTLE>那正好是梅兰妮离开会议现场的时间
<12-13,CASTLE>That's when Melanie left the conference.

330
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,040
<12-13,CASTLE>在语音留言中  她提到感觉事有蹊跷
<12-13,CASTLE>In her message, she said something wasn't right.

331
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,080
<12-13,CASTLE>是不是她看到那个男人  跟踪他去车库了
<12-13,CASTLE>What if she saw this guy and followed him to the garage?

332
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,890
<12-14,BECKETT>叫上埃斯波和人像画师
<12-14,BECKETT>All right. Grab Espo and a sketch artist.

333
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,910
<12-14,BECKETT>去韦德马克酒店跟保安谈谈
<12-14,BECKETT>Go down, talk to security at the Widmark.

334
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,790
<12-14,BECKETT>一小时内  我要那个男人的大概肖像
<12-14,BECKETT>I want a picture of this guy in circulation within the hour.

336
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,630
<12-16,CASTLE>凯特
<12-16,CASTLE>Kate.

337
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,910
<12-17,BECKETT>我本以为到了将他扳倒的时刻  卡塞尔
<12-17,BECKETT>I was finally gonna put this guy away, Castle.

338
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,380
<12-17,BECKETT>可如今我却在保护谋杀我母亲的男人
<12-17,BECKETT>And now I'm protecting the man that murdered my mother.

339
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,780
<13-1,GATES>议员先生  我们可以提供
<13-1,GATES>Senator, we can provide you

340
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,710
<13-1,GATES>更严密的安保措施
<13-1,GATES>with an increased security detail.

341
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,810
<13-1,GATES>但在我们逮捕那个男人之前
<13-1,GATES>But until we apprehend this man,

342
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,040
<13-1,GATES>我建议您推迟演讲
<13-1,GATES>I'd recommend you postpone your speech.

343
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,800
<13-2,CHIEF OF STAFF EVAN HOWARD>有必要吗
<13-2,CHIEF OF STAFF EVAN HOWARD>Is that really necessary?

344
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,590
<13-2,CHIEF OF STAFF EVAN HOWARD>这事不是已经在掌控之下了吗
<13-2,CHIEF OF STAFF EVAN HOWARD>I mean, isn't the threat all but neutralized?

345
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,430
<13-3,BECKETT>但我们还没阻止他
<13-3,BECKETT>But we haven't stopped him.

346
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,160
<13-3,BECKETT>我们谈论的是一个穷凶极恶
<13-3,BECKETT>Look, we're talking about someone that is ruthless,

347
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,610
<13-3,BECKETT>且有条不紊的罪犯
<13-3,BECKETT>methodical.

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,850
<13-3,BECKETT>他杀害梅兰妮·罗杰斯
<13-3,BECKETT>Someone that killed Melanie Rogers

349
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,790
<13-3,BECKETT>只是为了堵住她的嘴
<13-3,BECKETT>just to keep her from talking.

350
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,470
<13-3,BECKETT>那表明了他对这事
<13-3,BECKETT>That suggests a person that is

351
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,190
<13-3,BECKETT>是不达目的绝不死心
<13-3,BECKETT>intent on seeing this through.

352
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,160
<13-4,HOWARD>没错  但你也说了
<13-4,HOWARD>Yes, but you just said

353
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,890
<13-4,HOWARD>会加强安保措施
<13-4,HOWARD>you could increase his security detail.

354
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,530
<13-4,HOWARD>这可不是一般的会议
<13-4,HOWARD>Look, this isn't just any conference.

355
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,650
<13-4,HOWARD>在这次的演讲中  参议员将会
<13-4,HOWARD>The senator is going to unveil

357
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,780
<13-4,HOWARD>这将是他政治生涯中的一块基石
<13-4,HOWARD>that is the cornerstone of his term.

358
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,230
<13-4,HOWARD>况且我们已经发了媒体入场证
<13-4,HOWARD>We have issued dozens of press credentials--

359
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,630
<13-5,GATES>议员先生  我们无法保证您的安全

<13-6,BRACKEN>I'm not going to run and hide

364
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,810
<13-6,BRACKEN>一个疯子和他的笔记本恐吓我
<13-6,BRACKEN>just because some wacko with a notebook

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,840
<13-6,BRACKEN>不管用什么方法

<13-6,BRACKEN>you people do whatever it takes to stop this man.

00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,000
<13-7,GATES>好吧  议员先生
<13-7,GATES>Very well, Senator.

370
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,480
<13-7,GATES>贝克特探长需要跟您谈谈
<13-7,GATES>Detective Beckett will need a moment with you.

371
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,910
<13-8,BRACKEN>为什么
<13-8,BRACKEN>Why?

372
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,100
<13-9,GATES>因为她是这次调查的负责人
<13-9,GATES>Because she's leading the investigation.

373
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,550
<13-10,GATES>有什么原因
<13-10,GATES>Is there some reason why

374
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,690
<13-10,GATES>让您觉得与贝克特探长合作不妥的吗
<13-10,GATES>you don't want to work with Detective Beckett?

375
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,330
<13-11,BRACKEN>那我们私下谈吧  好吗  探长
<13-11,BRACKEN>Let's find somewhere private, shall we, Detective?

376
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,350

<13-11,BRACKEN>Well...

377
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,110
<14-1,BRACKEN>真是讽刺呀
<14-1,BRACKEN>Hard to miss the irony of this situation.

378
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,080
<14-2,BECKETT>布莱肯议员  您有敌人吗
<14-2,BECKETT>Senator Bracken, do you have any enemies?

379
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,120
<14-2,BECKETT>您觉得有什么人
<14-2,BECKETT>Is there anyone that you can think of

380
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,240
<14-2,BECKETT>想杀了你
<14-2,BECKETT>that would like to kill you?

381
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,430
<14-3,BRACKEN>我常常收到恐吓信件和电邮
<14-3,BRACKEN>I get threatening letters and e-mails all the time.

382
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,860
<14-3,BRACKEN>当上参议员都这样
<14-3,BRACKEN>Comes with the office.

383
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,080
<14-3,BRACKEN>我的幕僚长收集了一个文档
<14-3,BRACKEN>My chief of staff keeps a file.

384
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,220
<14-4,BECKETT>有做出实质性恐吓的人吗
<14-4,BECKETT>Anyone with a legitimate claim?

385
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,800
<14-5,BRACKEN>要想做到我这个位置
<14-5,BRACKEN>A man doesn't get to my position

386
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,090
<14-5,BRACKEN>免不了要得罪一些人
<14-5,BRACKEN>without upsetting people along the way.

387
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,440
<14-5,BRACKEN>但他们大多数还没疯到
<14-5,BRACKEN>Most of them aren't crazy enough

388
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,360
<14-5,BRACKEN>想杀我的地步
<14-5,BRACKEN>to want to try to kill me,

389
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,620
<14-5,BRACKEN>你就另当别论了
<14-5,BRACKEN>present company excluded.

390
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,820
<14-6,BECKETT>议员先生
<14-6,BECKETT>You know, Senator...

391
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,330
<14-6,BECKETT>现在我并不是你需要提防的人
<14-6,BECKETT>I'm not the one that you should be worried about right now.

392
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,540
<14-7,BRACKEN>探长  这儿只有我俩
<14-7,BRACKEN>It's just us here, Detective.

393
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,140
<14-7,BRACKEN>一个在逃枪击犯
<14-7,BRACKEN>A shooter on the loose,

394
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,610
<14-7,BRACKEN>瞄准我为目标
<14-7,BRACKEN>me in the crosshairs...

395
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,230
<14-7,BRACKEN>这一定是你的美梦成真时刻
<14-7,BRACKEN>Must be a dream come true for you.

396
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,760
<14-8,BECKETT>在我的美梦里
<14-8,BECKETT>In my dreams,

397
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,810
<14-8,BECKETT>扣动扳机的人是我
<14-8,BECKETT>I'm the one that gets to pull the trigger.

398
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,420
<14-8,BECKETT>但你知道吗
<14-8,BECKETT>But you know what?

399
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,270
<14-8,BECKETT>如果你觉得由我来负责调查不妥
<14-8,BECKETT>If you're not comfortable with me leading this investigation,

400
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,880
<14-8,BECKETT>你尽可以到外面告诉大家
<14-8,BECKETT>you're welcome to step outside

401
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
<14-8,BECKETT>为什么你觉得不妥
<14-8,BECKETT>and tell everyone why.

402
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,230
<14-9,BECKETT>那我猜  我们是暂时甩不掉对方了
<14-9,BECKETT>Well, then I guess we're stuck with each other.

403
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,640
<14-9,BECKETT>有一件事  我要说清楚
<14-9,BECKETT>So then let me make one thing clear.

404
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,150
<14-9,BECKETT>这个人杀害了梅兰妮·罗杰斯
<14-9,BECKETT>This man killed Melanie Rogers,

405
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,050
<14-9,BECKETT>当有人犯下谋杀罪行时
<14-9,BECKETT>and when someone commits murder,

406
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,060
<14-9,BECKETT>无论他是什么人  议员先生
<14-9,BECKETT>whoever he is, Senator,

407
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,380
<14-9,BECKETT>我都会将他绳之以法
<14-9,BECKETT>I will bring him to justice,

408
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,030
<14-9,BECKETT>不管这过程需要多久时间
<14-9,BECKETT>no matter how long it takes.

409
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,460
<14-10,BRACKEN>我会让我的办公厅主任把恐吓信给你送来
<14-10,BRACKEN>I'll have my chief of staff send over the letters.

410
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,080
<15-1,ESPOSITO>我告诉你  如果我是她
<15-1,ESPOSITO>I'll tell you something, if I'm her,

411
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,870
<15-1,ESPOSITO>我就在这坐着  捣腾书面文件
<15-1,ESPOSITO>I sit in there shuffling papers till whoever it is

412
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,040
<15-1,ESPOSITO>直到那家伙把布莱肯的脑瓜打开花
<15-1,ESPOSITO>puts a bullet in Bracken's head.

413
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,800
<15-2,RYAN>不  你不会的
<15-2,RYAN>No, you wouldn't,

414
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,570
<15-2,RYAN>因为那会使你变成和他一样
<15-2,RYAN>'cause that would make you no better than he is.

415
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,710
<15-3,ESPOSITO>他杀了贝克特的母亲
<15-3,ESPOSITO>The guy murdered Beckett's mother,

416
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,890
<15-3,ESPOSITO>蒙哥马利警监
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Captain Montgomery,

417
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,530
<15-3,ESPOSITO>谁知道还有什么人
<15-3,ESPOSITO>who knows who else.

418
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,370
<15-3,ESPOSITO>布莱肯罪有应得  就让老天惩罚他吧
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Bracken's got it coming to him, so I say, let it come.

419
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,780
<15-4,GATES>市长问有什么新情况  有吗
<15-4,GATES>Mayor's asking for an update. What's the latest?

420
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,100
<15-5,RYAN>来福枪上的序列号领我们找到了
<15-5,RYAN>The serial number on that rifle

421
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,440
<15-5,RYAN>一家新泽西州佩特森市的打猎用品店
<15-5,RYAN>led us to a hunting store in Paterson, New Jersey.

422
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,700
<15-5,RYAN>店主根据画像确认了嫌犯来过
<15-5,RYAN>The owner IDed our susppect from the sketch.

423
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,410
<15-5,RYAN>店里的记录指出他还购买了其它一些枪支
<15-5,RYAN>The paperwork indicates that several firearms were purchased,

424
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,410
<15-5,RYAN>但他留下的姓名和地址都是假的
<15-5,RYAN>but the name and address are all bogus.

425
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,620
<15-6,GATES>领几个人去排查商店周围的区域
<15-6,GATES>Okay, take a few units to canvass the area near the store

426
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,340
<15-6,GATES>记得带着疑犯画像
<15-6,GATES>and take the sketch of our suspect.

427
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,460
<15-6,GATES>好的
<15-6,GATES>All right.

428
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,130
<15-7,GATES>埃斯波西托警探
<15-7,GATES>Detective Esposito.

429
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,200
<15-9,GATES>-鉴证组有新消息吗  -有  长官
<15-9,GATES>- Any word from CSU? - Yes, sir.

430
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,720
<15-10,ESPOSITO>他们在行李袋里发现了
<15-10,ESPOSITO>They discovered part of a receipt

431
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,360
<15-10,ESPOSITO>一小块脏兮兮的收据
<15-10,ESPOSITO>with a smudge on it in the duffel bag.

432
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,260
<15-10,ESPOSITO>正在想办法提取部分指纹
<15-10,ESPOSITO>They're trying to get a partial print off of that.

433
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,380
<15-10,ESPOSITO>虽然收据上没写销售点
<15-10,ESPOSITO>Now there's no point of sale on the receipt,

434
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,440
<15-10,ESPOSITO>不过上面的库存检索码和这顶帽子的一样
<15-10,ESPOSITO>but the SKU number matched that hat.

435
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,560
<15-10,ESPOSITO>制造商把三州地区的经销网点
<15-10,ESPOSITO>The manufacturer's sending over

436
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,310
<15-10,ESPOSITO>发过来了
<15-10,ESPOSITO>a list of outlets in the Tristate area,

437
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,860
<15-10,ESPOSITO>但有200多个
<15-10,ESPOSITO>but there's over 200 locations.

438
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,780
<15-11,GATES>先重点排查新泽西的店
<15-11,GATES>Focus on the ones in Jersey first.

439
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
<15-11,GATES>离布莱肯演讲还有24小时
<15-11,GATES>24 hours before Bracken speaks--

440
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,660
<15-11,GATES>也许贝克特在恐吓信里能有什么发现
<15-11,GATES>maybe Beckett will have better luck with those threat letters.

441
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,450
<16-1,CASTLE>老天  这些人真该过过正常的生活
<16-1,CASTLE>Man, these people need to get a life.

442
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,880
<16-1,CASTLE>看起来这些人唯一的伙伴是
<16-1,CASTLE>Most of these guys, it seems their only companionship

443
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,870
<16-1,CASTLE>只能用微波跟他们交流的外星人
<16-1,CASTLE>is the space alien that talks to them through their microwave.

444
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,610
<16-2,BECKETT>这世上有很多孤独而困惑的人
<16-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, there's a lot of lonely and confused people out there.

445
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,430
<16-2,BECKETT>目前为止  没有一封信的笔迹
<16-2,BECKETT>But so far, none of the letters

446
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,290
<16-2,BECKETT>和嫌疑人笔记本上的相同
<16-2,BECKETT>match the handwriting in our suspect's notebook.

447
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,070
<16-3,CASTLE>凭着布莱肯的能力
<16-3,CASTLE>Considering what he's capable of,

448
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,640
<16-3,CASTLE>你不觉得他的敌人会更"高级"一点吗
<16-3,CASTLE>you would think Bracken would have more formidable enemies.

449
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,950
<16-4,BECKETT>显然你还没看见我写给他的信
<16-4,BECKETT>Oh, obviously, you never saw the letter that I sent him.

450
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,780
<16-5,CASTLE>事实上  我看见了  我喜欢你那种写法
<16-5,CASTLE>No, I did, actually. I liked the way you, uh,

451
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
<16-5,CASTLE>把"杀"上面的叉画成了一颗小心心
<16-5,CASTLE>dotted the "I" on "Kill" with a little heart.

452
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,490
<16-5,CASTLE>手法很赞
<16-5,CASTLE>It was a nice touch.

453
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,830
<16-6,BECKETT>我想呈现私人恩怨的感觉
<16-6,BECKETT>Well, I was trying to give it a personal feel.

454
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,180
<16-7,CASTLE>干得好
<16-7,CASTLE>Well done.

455
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,050
<16-9,CASTLE>我们真的不需要谈谈吗
<16-9,CASTLE>So we're really not gonna talk about this?

456
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,280
<16-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  有什么好谈的
<16-10,BECKETT>I mean, Castle, what is there to talk about?

457
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,570
<16-11,CASTLE>说实话吗  所有事都需要谈
<16-11,CASTLE>Honestly? Practically everything.

458
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,600
<16-12,BECKETT>正因如此  我能做的就是客观
<16-12,BECKETT>Which is why all I can do is treat it like another case,

459
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,580
<16-12,BECKETT>因为它就是平常案子
<16-12,BECKETT>'cause that's what it is. It's...

460
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,610
<16-12,BECKETT>和其他案子一样
<16-12,BECKETT>just like any other case.

461
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,590
<16-13,BECKETT>你累了  卡塞尔
<16-13,BECKETT>You're tired, Castle.

462
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,690
<16-13,BECKETT>不如你去休息吧
<16-13,BECKETT>Why don't you go get some rest?

463
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,360
<16-14,CASTLE>不不不  如果你想  我就陪着你
<16-14,CASTLE>No, no, no, I can stay if you like.

464
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,590
<16-15,BECKETT>不用了  回去吧
<16-15,BECKETT>No, come on. Go.

465
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,580
<16-15,BECKETT>需要什么我会打给你  好吗
<16-15,BECKETT>I'll call you if I need anything, okay?

466
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,710
<16-16,CASTLE>你真的很厉害
<16-16,CASTLE>You really are remarkable, you know that?

467
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,690
<17-1,BECKETT>我现在办的案子
<17-1,BECKETT>I'm working on this case

468
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,780
<17-1,BECKETT>在找嫌疑犯
<17-1,BECKETT>where I need to find a suspect,

469
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,050
<17-1,BECKETT>我发现了一个证据
<17-1,BECKETT>and I came across a piece of evidence.

470
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,840
<17-1,BECKETT>嫌疑人写的信
<17-1,BECKETT>It's a letter that he wrote.

471
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,100
<17-1,BECKETT>没写地址  也没署名
<17-1,BECKETT>And there's no address, there's no name,

472
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,100
<17-1,BECKETT>只有新泽西的邮戳
<17-1,BECKETT>just a postmark from New Jersey.

473
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,700
<17-1,BECKETT>我深知这就是我们的突破口
<17-1,BECKETT>And I know in my gut that this is our big break.

474
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,380
<17-1,BECKETT>无论怎样  我们都会找到他
<17-1,BECKETT>One way or another, it's gonna lead us straight to him.

475
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,650
<17-1,BECKETT>但是你现在却来找我
<17-1,BECKETT>Yet, here you are talking to me.

476
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,190
<17-2,BECKETT>如果找到这个嫌犯  那么一个坏人
<17-2,BECKETT>If we find this suspect, then someone worse,

477
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,930
<17-2,BECKETT>大坏人就会逃脱正义的制裁
<17-2,BECKETT>much worse, is going to escape justice.

478
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,770
<18-1,BURKE>我猜没有其他人知道信的事
<18-1,BURKE>I take it no one else knows about the letter.

479
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,460
<18-2,BECKETT>是  目前还没有
<18-2,BECKETT>No, not yet.

480
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,230
<18-3,BURKE>作为一名警官
<18-3,BURKE>Well, as a police officer,

481
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,240
<18-3,BURKE>你以前一定也碰过这种难题
<18-3,BURKE>you must have faced similar dilemmas.

482
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,470
<18-4,BECKETT>是啊
<18-4,BECKETT>Yeah.

483
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,460
<18-5,BURKE>这次有什么特殊的地方
<18-5,BURKE>Why is this time different?

484
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,450
<18-6,BECKETT>因为这次  感觉没有正确的选择
<18-6,BECKETT>Because this time, it feels like there's no right choice.

485
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,730
<18-7,BURKE>也许正确的选择
<18-7,BURKE>Maybe the right choice

486
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,150
<18-7,BURKE>就是你能接受的那个
<18-7,BURKE>is the one you can live with.

487
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,170
<19-1,CASTLE>你们看见贝克特了吗
<19-1,CASTLE>Hey, you guys seen Beckett?

488
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,320
<19-2,RYAN>没有  昨晚之后就没见过了
<19-2,RYAN>No. Uh, not since last night.

489
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,340
<19-2,RYAN>我们还以为她和你在一起
<19-2,RYAN>We thought she was with you.

490
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,840
<19-3,CASTLE>没有  我今早打给她好几次
<19-3,CASTLE>No, I tried her a couple of times this morning,

491
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,640
<19-3,CASTLE>她都没接
<19-3,CASTLE>but she wasn't picking up.

492
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,750
<19-4,ESPOSITO>好的  谢谢
<19-4,ESPOSITO>All right. Thanks.

493
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,040
<19-4,ESPOSITO>我正在联系
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Yo. I'm trying to get through

494
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,250
<19-4,ESPOSITO>那些卖棒球帽的店
<19-4,ESPOSITO>this list of stores that sell the baseball caps.

495
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,590
<19-4,ESPOSITO>一半的店还没开门
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Half of 'em aren't even open yet.

496
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,330
<19-4,ESPOSITO>你那边怎么样
<19-4,ESPOSITO>What about you?

497
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,840
<19-5,RYAN>啥都没有  枪的调查没有任何进展
<19-5,RYAN>Nada. The canvass around the gun store turned up empty.

498
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,910
<19-8,BECKETT>伙计们  嫌疑犯查的怎么样了
<19-8,BECKETT>You guys, where are we on the suspect?

499
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,850
<19-9,ESPOSITO>不怎么样
<19-9,ESPOSITO>Nowhere.

500
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,870
<19-9,ESPOSITO>而且布莱肯议员还有不到10小时就要演讲了
<19-9,ESPOSITO>And Senator Bracken speaks in less than ten hours.

501
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,030
<19-9,ESPOSITO>恐吓信那边有收获吗
<19-9,ESPOSITO>You find anything in those letters?

502
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,250
<19-10,BECKETT>没什么  没有重要发现
<19-10,BECKETT>Uh, no. Nothing significant.

503
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,130
<19-11,CASTLE>你还好吗
<19-11,CASTLE>You doing all right?

504
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,060
<19-12,BECKETT>等下再说
<19-12,BECKETT>I need a second.

505
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,370
<20-1,BECKETT>伙计们
<20-1,BECKETT>You guys...

506
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,370
<20-2,ESPOSITO>-我刚知道一件事  -我刚从鉴证组得到
<20-2,ESPOSITO>- There's something that I-- - I just heard back from C.S.U.

507
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,050
<20-2,ESPOSITO>行李袋中收据的检验结果
<20-2,ESPOSITO>on that receipt from the duffel bag.

508
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,150
<20-3,RYAN>他们在污渍上面提取到指纹了吗
<20-3,RYAN>They get a print off that smudge?

509
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,130
<20-4,ESPOSITO>没有  但是里面含有
<20-4,ESPOSITO>No, but it contained traces of

510
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,190
<20-4,ESPOSITO>汽车引擎用油和刹车片残留物
<20-4,ESPOSITO>synthetic motor oil and brake pad residue.

511
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,360
<20-5,CASTLE>听起来这人是个修车的
<20-5,CASTLE>Sounds like our guy's a mechanic.

512
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,020
<20-6,BECKETT>所以他可能就是在修理站附近
<20-6,BECKETT>So then maybe he was shopping for

513
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,530
<20-6,BECKETT>买了来福枪
<20-6,BECKETT>the rifle near work.

514
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,590
<20-6,BECKETT>那家店在哪里来着
<20-6,BECKETT>Where's that store again?

515
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,790
<20-7,RYAN>帕特森城  一下高速就是
<20-7,RYAN>Paterson, just off the highway.

516
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,430
<20-8,ESPOSITO>就从那里开始调查
<20-8,ESPOSITO>It's a place to start.

517
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,840
<20-9,BECKETT>你们先去  我马上发地址给你们
<20-9,BECKETT>All right, I'm gonna get you guys addresses on your way.

518
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,100
<20-9,BECKETT>我会把方圆五英里之内的服务站
<20-9,BECKETT>I'll compile a list of every service station

519
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,550
<20-9,BECKETT>制成一个表格
<20-9,BECKETT>within a 5-mile radius,

520
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,080
<20-9,BECKETT>我们以那为中心散开调查
<20-9,BECKETT>And we'll expand from there.

521
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,350
<20-10,CASTLE>你不是要说什么吗
<20-10,CASTLE>Were you gonna say something?

522
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,840
<20-11,BECKETT>不了  没时间说了
<20-11,BECKETT>No. We're past it.

523
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,570
<21-1,RYAN>谁能想到帕特森城会有这么多服务站
<21-1,RYAN>Who knew Paterson had so many service stations, huh?

524
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,880
<21-2,ESPOSITO>我确定在倒数第五个店的时候
<21-2,ESPOSITO>I'm pretty sure we left Paterson

525
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,060
<21-2,ESPOSITO>我们就出帕特森城了
<21-2,ESPOSITO>five shops ago.

527
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,340
<21-3,RYAN>20分钟后回来
<21-3,RYAN>Ugh. Back in 20 minutes.

528
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,810
<21-4,ESPOSITO>我们可不能在这干等20分钟
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Well, we don't have 20 minutes to waste.

529
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,900
<21-4,ESPOSITO>先去下一家吧  一会再绕回来
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Let's move on to the next on. We'll circle back around.

530
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,520
<21-5,RYAN>等一下  等一下
<21-5,RYAN>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

531
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,610
<21-5,RYAN>你看柜台上
<21-5,RYAN>Hey, look on top of the counter.

532
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,840
<21-5,RYAN>他们在卖这种帽子
<21-5,RYAN>They sell those hats here.

533
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,020
<21-6,ESPOSITO>开门  警察办案
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Open up! Police business!

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,420
<21-7,BEN>别把玻璃打破了
<21-7,BEN>Don't break my glass.

536
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,320
<21-7,BEN>我看见你们了
<21-7,BEN>Yeah, I see it.

<21-7,BEN>NYPD. You know this guy?

539
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,230
<21-8,ESPOSITO>眼熟
<21-8,ESPOSITO>Maybe.

540
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,330
<21-9,BEN>他看上去像是我的一位技师
<21-9,BEN>He looks like one of my mechanics.

541
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:24,920
<21-9,BEN>以前的一位技师
<21-9,BEN>I mean, he used to be.

542
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,420
<21-9,BEN>我大约三周前把他解雇了
<21-9,BEN>I laid him off, like, three weeks ago.

543
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,740
<21-10,RYAN>你这有什么他填写过的东西吗
<21-10,RYAN>Do you have any paperwork he might have filled out?

544
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,030
<21-10,RYAN>比如工作单
<21-10,RYAN>Maybe a work order?

545
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,790
<21-11,BEN>可能有一些
<21-11,BEN>I might have something back here.

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,090
<21-12,BEN>找到了  在这里
<21-12,BEN>Yeah, that's it right there.

<21-13,ESPOSITO>Handwriting's a match. It's our guy.

548
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,830
<22-1,CASTLE>罗伯特·麦克马尼斯有精神分裂症
<22-1,CASTLE>Robert McManus has a history of schizophrenia.

549
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,680
<22-1,CASTLE>进过好几次精神病院
<22-1,CASTLE>Multiple stays at a psych ward,

550
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,400
<22-1,CASTLE>最近一次发病是因他儿子去世引起的
<22-1,CASTLE>recent episodes were triggered by his son's death.

551
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,410
<22-3,BECKETT>我们的部署怎么样了
<22-3,BECKETT>Hey, where are we on deployment?

552
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,330
<22-4,ESPOSITO>市里所以的巡逻警察都有他的照片
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Every beat cop in the city has his photo.

553
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,770
<22-4,ESPOSITO>特警组的人正在他位于泽西的家里
<22-4,ESPOSITO>S.W.A.T.'s sitting on his place in Jersey,

554
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,210
<22-4,ESPOSITO>但是他的邻居说他已经一个月没去那了
<22-4,ESPOSITO>but his neighbors say he hasn't been there in a month.

555
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,630
<22-4,ESPOSITO>他消失了很长时间
<22-4,ESPOSITO>He disappears for long stretches.

556
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,030
<22-5,RYAN>我们查了他的财产情况
<22-5,RYAN>We're scouring through his financials,

557
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,160
<22-5,RYAN>但是数据都是很久以前的了
<22-5,RYAN>but they are severely outdated.

558
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,860
<22-5,RYAN>这人几年前就把他的账号注销了
<22-5,RYAN>The guy closed his accounts years ago.

559
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,320
<22-5,RYAN>基本上是隐居了
<22-5,RYAN>Basically living off the grid.

560
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,260
<22-6,GATES>有线索了
<22-6,GATES>Got something.

561

<22-6,GATES>我们在麦克马尼斯常去的一家餐馆附近排查
<22-6,GATES>We canvassed near a diner McManus used to frequent.

562
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,150
<22-6,GATES>一个旅店接待员认出了他
<22-6,GATES>An S.R.O. desk clerk just I.D.ed him.

563
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,810
<22-6,GATES>他在那已经待了一个月了
<22-6,GATES>He's been staying there a month.

<23-1,BECKETT>纽约警察

00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,260
<23-5,BECKETT>仔细搜查房间
<23-5,BECKETT>Take the place apart.

570
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,190
<23-5,BECKETT>找出任何能帮我们抓到他的线索
<23-5,BECKETT>Look for anything that might lead us to him.

571
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,460
<23-6,RYAN>我们应该搜查一下大楼的其它房间
<23-6,RYAN>We should check the rest of the building.

572
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,940
<23-7,BECKETT>我去问问经理麦克马尼斯的平时生活情况
<23-7,BECKETT>I'll talk to the manager for details on his routine.

573
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,940
<23-8,BECKETT>纽约警察  把手放在我能看见的地方
<23-8,BECKETT>NYPD. Show me your hands.

<23-9,BECKETT>Don't move or I'll shoot!

576
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,880
<24-1,CASTLE>我跟莱恩聊过了
<24-1,CASTLE>Hey. I just spoke to Ryan.

577
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,850
<24-1,CASTLE>麦克马尼斯仍然在逃
<24-1,CASTLE>McManus is still out there,

578
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,530
<24-1,CASTLE>但是警员们正在附近所有的大楼里
<24-1,CASTLE>but, uh, the boys are going door to door

579
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,380
<24-1,CASTLE>挨家挨户地查
<24-1,CASTLE>in every building nearby.

580
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,650
<24-2,BECKETT>他就在我的视线内
<24-2,BECKETT>I had him in my sights.

581
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,750
<24-2,BECKETT>我看到他了
<24-2,BECKETT>I had him.

582
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,840
<24-3,CASTLE>不就没打中吗
<24-3,CASTLE>So you missed.

583
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,510
<24-3,CASTLE>这事可能发生在任何人身上
<24-3,CASTLE>So what? It could happen to anyone.

584
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,310
<24-3,CASTLE>不是
<24-3,CASTLE>No.

585
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,060
<24-4,BECKETT>我不是没打中
<24-4,BECKETT>I didn't miss.

586
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,380
<24-5,CASTLE>你什么意思
<24-5,CASTLE>What do you mean?

587
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,640
<24-6,BECKETT>我在那些恐吓信里
<24-6,BECKETT>I found a letter...

588
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,410
<24-6,BECKETT>发现了一封信
<24-6,BECKETT>in the threats file.

589
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,600
<24-6,BECKETT>是麦克马尼斯写的
<24-6,BECKETT>It was frome McManus.

590
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,030
<24-7,CASTLE>你什么时候发现的
<24-7,CASTLE>How long have you known about this?

591
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,150
<24-7,CASTLE>昨天晚上
<24-7,CASTLE>Since last night.

592
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,200
<24-8,BECKETT>麦克马尼斯指责是布莱肯杀了他儿子
<24-8,BECKETT>McManus was accusing Bracken of murdering his son.

593
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,160
<24-8,BECKETT>我调查了一下  他儿子24岁
<24-8,BECKETT>I looked into it. He was a 24-year-old kid.

594
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,370
<24-8,BECKETT>是布莱肯再选的实习生
<24-8,BECKETT>He was an intern for Bracken's reelection campaign.

595
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,340
<24-8,BECKETT>他原本跟一个记者约好见面
<24-8,BECKETT>He had a meeting scheduled with a reporter,

596
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,510
<24-8,BECKETT>但第二天有人发现他上吊了
<24-8,BECKETT>and the next day they found him hanged.

597
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,720
<24-9,CASTLE>你认为是布莱肯
<24-9,CASTLE>And you think Bracken--

598
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,800
<24-10,BECKETT>我也不清楚  卡塞尔  我的天
<24-10,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle. My god.

599
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,870
<24-11,BECKETT>我差一点就把证据销毁了
<24-11,BECKETT>I almost suppressed evidence.

600
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,000
<24-11,BECKETT>我本来打算把那封信烧掉
<24-11,BECKETT>I was gonna burn that letter.

601
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,830
<24-12,CASTLE>但你没有烧
<24-12,CASTLE>But you didn't.

602
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,810
<24-13,BECKETT>我不是没打中麦克马尼斯
<24-13,BECKETT>I didn't miss McManus.

603
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,030
<24-13,BECKETT>我是看到他眼睛里的那份悲痛后
<24-13,BECKETT>I looked him in the eye and I saw his pain.

604
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,710
<24-13,BECKETT>不忍心开枪
<24-13,BECKETT>And I couldn't take that shot.

605
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,990
<24-14,BECKETT>如果我想让他逃走
<24-14,BECKETT>What if I wanted him to get away,

606
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,420
<24-14,BECKETT>想让他完成计划
<24-14,BECKETT>wanted him to go through with this?

607
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,000
<24-14,BECKETT>那我又变成了什么样的人
<24-14,BECKETT>Then what does that make me?

608
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,530
<24-15,BECKETT>有什么新情况吗
<24-15,BECKETT>Is there anything new?

609
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,390
<24-16,GATES>关于麦克马尼斯的还没有
<24-16,GATES>Nothing yet on McManus,

610
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,330
<24-16,GATES>但是在他的房间里搜出了导线
<24-16,GATES>but a search of his room turned up wires,

611
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,250
<24-16,GATES>引爆器  还有C4的残留
<24-16,GATES>a detonator, traces of c-4.

612
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,440
<24-16,GATES>他似乎是在制造炸弹
<24-16,GATES>It looks like he was building a bomb.

613
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,760
<24-17,BECKETT>炸弹
<24-17,BECKETT>A bomb? Uh...

614
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,950
<24-17,BECKETT>找到炸弹了吗
<24-17,BECKETT>Did anyone find it?

615
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,750
<24-18,GATES>没有  如果他造了一个炸弹
<24-18,GATES>No. If he built something,

616
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,250
<24-18,GATES>要么是他带在身上
<24-18,GATES>It's either with him

617
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,360
<24-18,GATES>要么就是已经放置好就等爆炸了
<24-18,GATES>or already out there waiting to go off.

618
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,920
<25-1,CASTLE>贝克特  等一下
<25-1,CASTLE>Beckett, hang on.

619
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,600
<25-2,BECKETT>他有一把步枪  卡塞尔
<25-2,BECKETT>He had a rifle, Castle.

620
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,200
<25-2,BECKETT>是步枪  不是炸弹
<25-2,BECKETT>A rifle. Not a bomb.

621
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,250
<25-2,BECKETT>要是他在今晚的大会上引爆了炸弹
<25-2,BECKETT>If he detonates that thing tonight at the conference

622
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,870
<25-2,BECKETT>无辜的人就会受伤
<25-2,BECKETT>and innocent people get hurt--

623
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,130
<25-3,CASTLE>这不是你的错
<25-3,CASTLE>Okay, this is not your fault.

624
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,450
<25-4,BECKETT>怎会不是我的错  我是警察
<25-4,BECKETT>How is it not my fault? I'm a cop.

625
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,550
<25-4,BECKETT>我没有做好我的本职工作
<25-4,BECKETT>I had a job to do and I didn't do it.

626
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,490
<25-4,BECKETT>我得弥补我的过错
<25-4,BECKETT>I've gotta make this right.

627
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,900
<25-4,BECKETT>我得找到那颗炸弹  保护布莱肯的生命安全
<25-4,BECKETT>I've gotta find that bomb and save Bracken's life.

628
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,350
<25-5,CASTLE>貌似有人帮你了
<25-5,CASTLE>Looks like you just got some help.

629
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,270
<25-6,ESPOSITO>我们发现他在三个街区外的楼顶上躲着
<25-6,ESPOSITO>Found him hiding on a rooftop three blocks away.

630
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,390
<25-7,BECKETT>找到炸弹了吗
<25-7,BECKETT>What about the bomb?

631
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:40,930
<25-8,ESPOSITO>我们已经问过他了
<25-8,ESPOSITO>Asked him about it.

632
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,400
<25-8,ESPOSITO>也问了他有关梅兰妮·罗杰斯的事
<25-8,ESPOSITO>Asked him about Melanie Rogers, too.

633
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,440
<25-8,ESPOSITO>他不肯说话
<25-8,ESPOSITO>He's not much of a talker.

634
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
<25-9,RYAN>被捕后  他一句话都没说过
<25-9,RYAN>He hasn't said a word since we picked him up.

635
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,640
<25-10,BECKETT>带他去审讯
<25-10,BECKETT>Take him to interrogation.

636
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,050
<25-11,ESPOSITO>你凭什么认为他会和你谈话
<25-11,ESPOSITO>What makes you think he's gonna talk to you?

637
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,450
<25-12,BECKETT>因为
<25-12,BECKETT>'Cause...

638
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,350
<25-12,BECKETT>我理解他
<25-12,BECKETT>I know him.

639
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,150
<26-1,BECKETT>你好  罗伯特
<26-1,BECKETT>Hi, Robert.

640
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,690
<26-1,BECKETT>我是凯特
<26-1,BECKETT>I'm Kate.

641
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,060
<26-1,BECKETT>为什么不把手铐取下来呢
<26-1,BECKETT>Why don't you take those things off?

642
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,380
<26-1,BECKETT>戴着很不舒服吧
<26-1,BECKETT>They look uncomfortable.

643
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,860
<26-2,BECKETT>我理解失去至爱的感受
<26-2,BECKETT>I know what it's like to lose someone that you love,

644
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,860
<26-2,BECKETT>要承受那样的痛苦
<26-2,BECKETT>to live with that pain...

645
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,710
<26-2,BECKETT>忍受那种愤怒
<26-2,BECKETT>to feel the rage

646
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,410
<26-2,BECKETT>尤其是当你面对罪魁祸首时
<26-2,BECKETT>towards the person responsible for it...

647
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,580
<26-2,BECKETT>面对布莱肯时
<26-2,BECKETT>towards Bracken.

648
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
<27-1,BECKETT>他夺走了我的亲人
<27-1,BECKETT>He took someone close to me.

649
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,920
<27-1,BECKETT>他杀害了我的母亲
<27-1,BECKETT>He killed my mother

650
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
<27-1,BECKETT>他还不肯放过我的朋友
<27-1,BECKETT>and then he went after my friends,

651
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,390
<27-1,BECKETT>甚至想杀我灭口
<27-1,BECKETT>even tried to kill me.

652
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,050
<27-2,GATES>她是在说布莱肯吗
<27-2,GATES>Is she talking about Bracken?

653
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,620
<27-3,CASTLE>她只是在套话
<27-3,CASTLE>She's... just trying to get through to him anyway you can.

654
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,540
<27-4,ROBERT MCMANUS>那个男人杀了我儿子
<27-4,ROBERT MCMANUS>The man killed my son.

655
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,770
<27-4,ROBERT MCMANUS>没人在乎
<27-4,ROBERT MCMANUS>No one cared.

656
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,830
<27-5,BECKETT>我在乎
<27-5,BECKETT>I care.

657
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,730
<27-6,MCMANUS>我要他血债血还
<27-6,MCMANUS>He needs to pay.

658
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,440
<27-7,BECKETT>但不是用炸弹啊  罗伯特
<27-7,BECKETT>Not with a bomb, Robert.

659
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,090
<27-7,BECKETT>我们俩和他不一样
<27-7,BECKETT>You and me, we're not like him.

660
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,850
<27-7,BECKETT>我们不会伤及无辜
<27-7,BECKETT>We don't hurt innocent people.

661
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,090
<27-7,BECKETT>C4炸弹在哪儿
<27-7,BECKETT>Where's the C-4?

662
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,830
<27-8,MCMANUS>你在迷惑我
<27-8,MCMANUS>You're trying to confuse me...

663
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,110
<27-8,MCMANUS>哄骗我
<27-8,MCMANUS>or trick me...

664
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,320
<27-8,MCMANUS>让我说出不该说的话
<27-8,MCMANUS>into saying something I shouldn't.

665
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,080
<27-9,BECKETT>我跟你一样想要扳倒布莱肯
<27-9,BECKETT>I'm trying to take down Bracken, same as you.

666
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,460
<27-9,BECKETT>但我们得采取正确的方式
<27-9,BECKETT>And we gotta do it in the right way.

667
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,900
<27-9,BECKETT>你和我是一伙的  罗伯特
<27-9,BECKETT>You and me are on the same side, Robert.

668
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,190
<27-10,MCMANUS>你和他是一伙的
<27-10,MCMANUS>You're on his side.

669
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,030
<27-10,MCMANUS>他控制了每个人
<27-10,MCMANUS>He controls everybody.

670
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,020
<27-10,MCMANUS>你们都被他握在掌心里
<27-10,MCMANUS>You're all in his pocket.

671
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,500
<27-10,MCMANUS>你们中的每一个人
<27-10,MCMANUS>Every last one of ya!

672
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,610
<27-10,MCMANUS>不  我没有
<27-10,MCMANUS>No, I'm not.

673
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,400
<27-11,BECKETT>我和你一样  罗伯特
<27-11,BECKETT>I'm just like you, Robert.

674
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
<27-12,GATES>她套不出什么话了
<27-12,GATES>She's losing him.

675
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,140
<27-13,MCMANUS>你和我不一样
<27-13,MCMANUS>You're not like me.

676
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,740
<27-13,MCMANUS>你在捏造事实
<27-13,MCMANUS>You're making stuff up,

677
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,830
<27-13,MCMANUS>编造故事
<27-13,MCMANUS>making up stories!

678
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,490
<27-13,MCMANUS>如果你遭受过我经历的一切
<27-13,MCMANUS>If you went through what I went through,

679
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,360
<27-13,MCMANUS>你也会想他死的
<27-13,MCMANUS>you would want to see him dead!

680
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,680
<27-14,BECKETT>我的每句话都千真万确
<27-14,BECKETT>Everything that I told you was true.

681
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,310
<27-14,BECKETT>罗伯特  看着我
<27-14,BECKETT>Robert, look at me.

682
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,820
<27-14,BECKETT>C4炸弹在哪儿
<27-14,BECKETT>Where is the C-4?

683
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,960
<27-15,BECKETT>如果炸弹爆炸了
<27-15,BECKETT>If that thing goes off,

684
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,360
<27-15,BECKETT>我们会手染鲜血
<27-15,BECKETT>then there's blood on our hands,

685
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,800
<27-15,BECKETT>愧疚会将我侵蚀
<27-15,BECKETT>And I cannot live with that

686
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,370
<27-15,BECKETT>你也一样
<27-15,BECKETT>and I know that you can't either.

687
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,870
<27-16,GATES>警探  我有话和你说
<27-16,GATES>Detective, a word.

688
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,200
<27-17,BECKETT>-长官  -警探
<27-17,BECKETT>- Sir.  - Detective.

689
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,800
<28-1,BECKETT>长官  我能让他开口
<28-1,BECKETT>Sir, I can do this. I can reach him.

690
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,230
<28-2,GATES>都结束了  警探
<28-2,GATES>It's over, detective.

691
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,290
<28-3,BECKETT>再给我一分钟
<28-3,BECKETT>Just give me another minute.

692
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,160
<28-4,GATES>我刚接到联邦政府的电话
<28-4,GATES>I just got a call from the feds.

693
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,660
<28-4,GATES>他们找到炸弹了
<28-4,GATES>They found the bomb.

694
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,060
<28-4,GATES>麦克马尼斯在邮局租了一个邮箱
<28-4,GATES>Mcmanus rented a box at a post office.

695
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,220
<29-1,GATES>C4炸弹就在里面
<29-1,GATES>The C-4 was there.

696
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,060
<29-1,GATES>他把电线接到背心上
<29-1,GATES>He'd wired it into a vest.

697
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,810
<29-1,GATES>不知从哪儿拿到了会议通行证
<29-1,GATES>He also obtained credentials for the conference somehow.

698
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,880
<29-2,BRACKEN>谢谢你  警监
<29-2,BRACKEN>Well, thank you, captain,

699
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,290
<29-2,BRACKEN>谢谢你所做的一切
<29-2,BRACKEN>For everything you've done.

700
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,080
<29-3,GATES>实际上
<29-3,GATES>Well, actually,

701
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,200
<29-3,GATES>这大多归功于贝克特警探
<29-3,GATES>Detective Beckett deserves most of the credit.

702
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,710
<29-3,GATES>调查是由她带领的
<29-3,GATES>She led the team.

703
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,970
<29-3,GATES>抱歉  议员先生先生
<29-3,GATES>Excuse me, senator.

704
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,060
<29-3,GATES>下午好  市长先生
<29-3,GATES>Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor.

705
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,950
<29-4,BRACKEN>我听说了
<29-4,BRACKEN>I heard how you led the team.

706
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,910
<29-4,BRACKEN>你近距离朝疑犯开了两枪
<29-4,BRACKEN>You fired, what, two shots from close range

707
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,700
<29-4,BRACKEN>却都未命中
<29-4,BRACKEN>and both of them missed?

708
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,330
<29-4,BRACKEN>嘴上总是提正义
<29-4,BRACKEN>All this talk about justice...

709
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,120
<29-4,BRACKEN>我没看错你
<29-4,BRACKEN>I guess I was right about you.

710
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,330
<30-1,CASTLE>看看这个
<30-1,CASTLE>Check this out.

711
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,720
<30-1,CASTLE>庆祝我们侦破一桩难案
<30-1,CASTLE>What better way to celebrate the end of a difficult case

712
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,690
<30-1,CASTLE>有什么东西能胜过
<30-1,CASTLE>than with a bottle

713
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,920
<30-1,CASTLE>一瓶...你在干嘛呢
<30-1,CASTLE>of-- what are you doing?

714
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,900
<30-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看看这个理应是
<30-2,BECKETT>Castle, look at this vest

715
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,810
<30-2,BECKETT>麦克马尼斯制作的背心
<30-2,BECKETT>Mcmanus supposedly made.

716
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,700
<30-2,BECKETT>这些尼龙扣条和电线
<30-2,BECKETT>The zip ties and the wires...

717
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,490
<30-2,BECKETT>做工非常专业
<30-2,BECKETT>They're expertly done.

718
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,790
<30-2,BECKETT>你见过麦克马尼斯
<30-2,BECKETT>You saw Mcmanus.

719
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,220
<30-2,BECKETT>他勉强能够自己扣好扣子
<30-2,BECKETT>He was barely able to button his own shirt.

720
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,530
<30-3,CASTLE>以他的目前状态  的确不可能
<30-3,CASTLE>In his current state, no.

721
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,730
<30-3,CASTLE>但他可能是在服药期间制作的
<30-3,CASTLE>But he could've done this while he was still on his meds.

722
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,620
<30-4,BECKETT>那么梅兰妮的尸体呢
<30-4,BECKETT>And what about Melanie's body?

723
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,920
<30-4,BECKETT>他烧毁尸体  敲掉她的牙齿
<30-4,BECKETT>He burned it and then he knocked out her teeth

724
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,640
<30-4,BECKETT>使得尸体无法辨认
<30-4,BECKETT>to keep it unidentifiable.

725
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,230
<30-4,BECKETT>接着他却把行李袋留在
<30-4,BECKETT>And then he leaves a duffel bag

726
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,750
<30-4,BECKETT>一辆被偷的车里  任由我们找到
<30-4,BECKETT>in a stolen car for us to find?

727
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,180
<30-4,BECKETT>这说不通啊
<30-4,BECKETT>That doesn't make any sense.

728
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,330
<30-5,CASTLE>他精神不正常
<30-5,CASTLE>Well, he's mentally ill.

729
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,580
<30-5,CASTLE>我是说  他不一定按套路出牌
<30-5,CASTLE>I mean, not everything he does is going to make sense.

730
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,390
<30-6,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  事情不太对劲
<30-6,BECKETT>No, Castle. Something is not right.

731
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,010
<30-6,BECKETT>梅兰妮的语音邮件里有打火机声
<30-6,BECKETT>That zippo lighter that we heard on Melanie's voice mail--

732
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,190
<30-6,BECKETT>麦克马尼斯不抽烟
<30-6,BECKETT>Mcmanus doesn't smoke.

733
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,560
<30-6,BECKETT>我们翻遍他家都没找到打火机
<30-6,BECKETT>We didn't find a zippo in any of his things.

734
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,390
<30-6,BECKETT>凯特
<30-6,BECKETT>Kate...

735
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,050
<30-7,CASTLE>算了吧
<30-7,CASTLE>Let it go.

736
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,340
<30-7,CASTLE>你用不着去证明什么
<30-7,CASTLE>I mean, you don't have anything to prove,

737
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,740
<30-7,CASTLE>尤其不用证明给布莱肯看
<30-7,CASTLE>not to Bracken,

738
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,680
<30-7,CASTLE>也不用给我  或是你自己看
<30-7,CASTLE>not to me, not to yourself.

739
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,260
<30-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这不是在证明什么
<30-8,BECKETT>Castle, this isn't about proving something.

740
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,840
<30-8,BECKETT>这是证据
<30-8,BECKETT>This is about evidence.

741
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,820
<30-9,CASTLE>所有这些证据
<30-9,CASTLE>Well, all the evidence--

742
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,460
<30-9,CASTLE>信  笔记本  炸弹
<30-9,CASTLE>The letter, the notebook, the bomb--

743
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,250
<30-9,CASTLE>全都指向麦克马尼斯
<30-9,CASTLE>everything traces back to McManus

744
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,210
<30-10,BECKETT>万一是有人希望我们去找他呢
<30-10,BECKETT>What if somebody wanted us to find him?

745
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,500
<30-10,BECKETT>万一是他们陷害他呢
<30-10,BECKETT>What if they're framing him

746
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,170
<30-10,BECKETT>这样一来  大家都以为威胁解除了
<30-10,BECKETT>So that everyone would think that the threat was over

747
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,280
<30-10,BECKETT>但真正的杀手还逍遥法外
<30-10,BECKETT>while the real assassin is still out there?

748
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,620
<30-10,BECKETT>马夹里的炸弹
<30-10,BECKETT>The c-4 in the vest--

749
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,890
<30-10,BECKETT>也许真凶希望我们找到那个炸弹
<30-10,BECKETT>what if that was the bomb that we were supposed to find

750
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,510
<30-10,BECKETT>但其实还有一颗炸弹安放在别处
<30-10,BECKETT>and there's another bomb that's still out there,

751
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,300
<30-10,BECKETT>这颗才是为政策演讲准备的
<30-10,BECKETT>planned for the keynote address?

752
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,310
<30-10,BECKETT>这次演讲活动的时间和地点
<30-10,BECKETT>That's an event whose time and place

753
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,730
<30-10,BECKETT>在几周前就公布了
<30-10,BECKETT>has been known for weeks.

754
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,140
<30-11,CASTLE>如果炸弹在布莱肯演讲时爆炸了
<30-11,CASTLE>If a bomb went off during Bracken's speech,

755
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,440
<30-11,CASTLE>他们可以说
<30-11,CASTLE>They could say...

756
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,080
<30-11,CASTLE>麦克马尼斯在被捕前就设好了炸弹
<30-11,CASTLE>McManus set it before he was apprehended.

757
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
<30-12,BECKETT>布莱肯会在八点时登场
<30-12,BECKETT>Bracken's supposed to go onstage at 8:00.

758
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,860
<30-12,BECKETT>还有二十分钟
<30-12,BECKETT>That's 20 minutes away.

759
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,700
<30-12,BECKETT>我知道我并无任何证据
<30-12,BECKETT>Look, I know that I don't have any proof.

760
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,330
<30-12,BECKETT>我知道这听起来很疯狂
<30-12,BECKETT>I know that this sounds crazy--

761
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,620
<30-13,CASTLE>而且你也知道布莱肯的演讲有多重要
<30-13,CASTLE>And you know how determined Bracken was to give this speech.

762
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,890
<30-13,CASTLE>万一你终止了演讲
<30-13,CASTLE>If you stop it and...

763
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,530
<30-13,CASTLE>却发现自己错了
<30-13,CASTLE>you're wrong,

764
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,120
<30-13,CASTLE>你的职业生涯就完了
<30-13,CASTLE>Your career is over.

765
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,120
<30-14,BECKETT>如果我是对的呢
<30-14,BECKETT>And if I'm right?

766
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,110
<30-15,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  警号41319
<30-15,BECKETT>This is detective Beckett. Badge number 4-1-3-1-9.

767
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,770
<30-15,BECKETT>请在韦德马克酒店实行紧急疏散
<30-15,BECKETT>I'm calling for the evacuation of the Widmark Hotel.

768
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,270
<31-1,BRACKEN>贝克特探长
<31-1,BRACKEN>Detective Beckett.

769
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,930
<31-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你去和防爆小组沟通一下
<31-2,BECKETT>Castle, why don't you see if you can get an update

770
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,900
<31-2,BECKETT>看看有没新情况
<31-2,BECKETT>from the bomb squad?

771
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,630
<31-3,CASTLE>好的
<31-3,CASTLE>Right.

772
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,570
<31-4,BRACKEN>出什么事了
<31-4,BRACKEN>What the hell is going on here?

773
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,120
<31-4,BRACKEN>谁把防爆小组找来了
<31-4,BRACKEN>Who called in the bomb squad?

774
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,710
<31-5,BECKETT>我们得到可靠消息  说有威胁
<31-5,BECKETT>We had a credible threat, sir.

775
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,520
<31-6,BRACKEN>从哪来的可靠消息
<31-6,BRACKEN>Credible according to who?

776
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,890
<31-7,BECKETT>我想单独和你说
<31-7,BECKETT>I think we should speak alone.

777
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,620
<31-8,BECKETT>我们认为  有个你认识的人
<31-8,BECKETT>We believe someone that you know

778
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,850
<31-8,BECKETT>想要杀你
<31-8,BECKETT>is trying to kill you.

779
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,470
<31-8,BECKETT>什么
<31-8,BECKETT>What?

780
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,450
<31-9,BRACKEN>你们不是把那人关起来了吗
<31-9,BRACKEN>You already have the man in custody.

781
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,370
<31-10,BECKETT>我们认为麦克马尼斯是被陷害的
<31-10,BECKETT>We believe McManus was set up

782
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,320
<31-10,BECKETT>因为他寄给你的那封威胁信
<31-10,BECKETT>because of the threatening letter that he sent you,

783
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,960
<31-10,BECKETT>这证明真正的黑手
<31-10,BECKETT>which means the individual involved

784
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,420
<31-10,BECKETT>能够接触到你办公室的文件
<31-10,BECKETT>has access to the files in your office.

785
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,060
<31-11,BRACKEN>那你有证据证明这一切吗
<31-11,BRACKEN>And you have evidence for all of this?

786
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,180
<31-11,BRACKEN>你没有证据
<31-11,BRACKEN>You don't have evidence?

787
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,400
<31-12,BECKETT>我是不想让小疏忽酿成大错误
<31-12,BECKETT>Look, I'm not gonna make this kind of accusation lightly.

788
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,780
<31-13,BRACKEN>于是你就叫来了防爆小组
<31-13,BRACKEN>Are you--so you called in a bomb scare based on--

789
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,190
<31-13,BRACKEN>凭什么  就凭你的直觉吗
<31-13,BRACKEN>On--on what, a hunch?

791
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,480
<31-15,BOMB SQUAD MEMBER KOCH>我们完成了搜查
<31-15,BOMB SQUAD MEMBER KOCH>We finished our search

792
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,370
<31-15,BOMB SQUAD MEMBER KOCH>搜遍了主要的目标区域
<31-15,BOMB SQUAD MEMBER KOCH>of the primary target area, detective.

793
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,030
<31-15,BOMB SQUAD MEMBER KOCH>没有找到爆炸物
<31-15,BOMB SQUAD MEMBER KOCH>We found no explosive device.

794
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,680
<31-16,BECKETT>那舞台呢  你们搜查了演讲台吗
<31-16,BECKETT>What about the stage? Did you check the podium?

795
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,460
<31-17,KOCH>我们以议员先生演讲的位置为圆心
<31-17,KOCH>We swept everything in a 50-foot radius

796
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,920
<31-17,KOCH>把半径15米内的地方都搜遍了
<31-17,KOCH>of where the senator would be speaking.

797
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,870
<31-18,BRACKEN>这真是荒唐
<31-18,BRACKEN>All right, well, this is ridiculous.

798
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,240
<31-18,BRACKEN>我们快把大家都叫回里面吧
<31-18,BRACKEN>Let's just get everybody back inside.

799
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,890
<31-19,KOCH>议员先生  不好意思  我们还需要
<31-19,KOCH>I'm sorry, senator. We still have to conduct

800
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,660
<31-19,KOCH>对整栋楼做全面搜查
<31-19,KOCH>a thorough search of the building.

801
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,670
<31-19,KOCH>恐怕还需要几个小时
<31-19,KOCH>It's gonna take a few more hours, I'm afraid.

802
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,910
<31-20,BRACKEN>你以为我不知道你在耍什么花样吗
<31-20,BRACKEN>You think I don't know what you're doing?

803
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,190
<31-20,BRACKEN>你让麦克马尼斯跑了  想让他杀了我
<31-20,BRACKEN>You let McManus get away so that he would take me down,

804
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,090
<31-20,BRACKEN>当你的计划落空后  你就想要
<31-20,BRACKEN>and when that didn't play out, you decided to ruin

805
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,280
<31-20,BRACKEN>毁掉我仕途中最重要的时刻
<31-20,BRACKEN>the most important moment of my career.

806
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,110
<31-21,BECKETT>这跟……
<31-21,BECKETT>That's not what this is a--

807
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,070
<31-22,BRACKEN>省省吧  你就等着接受调查吧
<31-22,BRACKEN>No, you save that for the review board.

808
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,010
<31-22,BRACKEN>你玩过火了
<31-22,BRACKEN>You have overplayed your hand,

809
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,640
<31-22,BRACKEN>你看我怎么灭了你
<31-22,BRACKEN>and I am going to bury you.

810
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,530
<31-23,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不明白
<31-23,BECKETT>Oh, god, Castle. I don't understand.

811
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,120
<31-23,BECKETT>我们怎么会弄错了
<31-23,BECKETT>How did we get this so wrong?

812
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,200
<31-24,CASTLE>我们知道是在冒险
<31-24,CASTLE>We knew we were taking a risk.

813
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,670
<31-25,BECKETT>不  他们陷害麦克马尼斯
<31-25,BECKETT>No, there's gotta be a reason

814
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,570
<31-25,BECKETT>肯定是有原因的
<31-25,BECKETT>that they were framing McManus.

815
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,320
<31-25,BECKETT>他们今晚会有所行动
<31-25,BECKETT>They had to have been planning this for tonight, here.

816
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,850
<31-25,BECKETT>只有这样才说得通
<31-25,BECKETT>That's the only thing that makes sense.

817
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,750
<31-26,CASTLE>或许他没被陷害
<31-26,CASTLE>Or he wasn't being framed.

818
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,680
<31-27,BECKETT>也许他们没能把炸弹安置在室内
<31-27,BECKETT>Maybe they couldn't get the bomb in the building.

819
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,760
<31-27,BECKETT>保安部署太严了
<31-27,BECKETT>With the heightened security,

820
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,150
<31-27,BECKETT>麦克马尼斯又逍遥法外
<31-27,BECKETT>because McManus was on the loose,

821
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,060
<31-27,BECKETT>也许他们被迫制定了新计划
<31-27,BECKETT>maybe they had to make a different plan.

822
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,930
<31-27,BECKETT>把炸弹装在了更容易的地方
<31-27,BECKETT>Place the bomb somewhere more accessible.

823
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,680
<31-28,CASTLE>凯特
<31-28,CASTLE>Kate...

824
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,420
<31-28,CASTLE>结束了
<31-28,CASTLE>It's over.

825
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,220
<31-29,CASTLE>凯特
<31-29,CASTLE>Kate!

826

<31-29,CASTLE>Castle...

827
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,020
<31-30,BECKETT>是那司机
<31-30,BECKETT>The driver.

<32-2,CASTLE>他为什么突然想杀你
<32-2,CASTLE>Any reason why he'd suddenly want you dead?

832
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,090
<32-3,BRACKEN>我猜是有人给了他一大笔钱吧
<32-3,BRACKEN>I assume because someone paid him a great deal of money.

833
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,110
<32-4,CASTLE>你看起来并不惊讶
<32-4,CASTLE>You don't seem shocked.

<32-5,BRACKEN>只是大多数人意识不到
<32-5,BRACKEN>one that most people don't see,

836

<32-5,BRACKEN>黑暗的那边被金钱和权力所掌控

<32-5,BRACKEN>黑暗面的人们会不择手段
<32-5,BRACKEN>And the people in it will do anything they can

<32-5,BRACKEN>让自己站在万人之上
<32-5,BRACKEN>to stay on top.

839
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,670
<32-5,BRACKEN>但这些你是知道的
<32-5,BRACKEN>But I assume that you already know that.

840
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,640
<32-6,CASTLE>我做不到
<32-6,CASTLE>I wouldn't have done it, you know,

841
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,470
<32-6,CASTLE>她的所作所为
<32-6,CASTLE>what she did.

842
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,630
<32-6,CASTLE>我会站在那里旁观
<32-6,CASTLE>I'd have stood and watched.

843
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,130
<32-7,BECKETT>他不肯开口
<32-7,BECKETT>So he's not talking.

844
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,550
<32-7,BECKETT>但在他的公寓搜出了一双

845
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,360
<32-7,BECKETT>带有梅兰妮·罗杰斯血迹的手套
<32-7,BECKETT>with traces of Melanie Rogers' blood on it.

846
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,590
<32-7,BECKETT>他们还发现了假胡子和棒球帽
<32-7,BECKETT>They also found a fake beard and a baseball cap

847
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,020
<32-7,BECKETT>和麦克马尼斯的一样
<32-7,BECKETT>Just like McManus'.

848
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,560
<32-8,CASTLE>以便让会议上的人看到麦克马尼斯
<32-8,CASTLE>So McManus could be seen at the conference by security.

849
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,730
<32-8,CASTLE>这都是设计好的
<32-8,CASTLE>It's all part of the setup.

850
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,970
<32-9,BRACKEN>梅兰妮见过诺阿很多次
<32-9,BRACKEN>Melanie met Noah a bunch of times.

851
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,100
<32-9,BRACKEN>那天她可能认出了他
<32-9,BRACKEN>She probably recognized him on the day,

852
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,300
<32-9,BRACKEN>对他的行为起疑
<32-9,BRACKEN>wondered what he was doing,

853
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,440
<32-9,BRACKEN>跟踪了他
<32-9,BRACKEN>and followed him.

854
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,330
<32-10,BECKETT>如果她发现了他
<32-10,BECKETT>If she got on to him,

855
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,270
<32-10,BECKETT>他别无选择  只能杀了她
<32-10,BECKETT>he would've had no choice but to kill her.

856
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,160
<32-11,BRACKEN>真遗憾

<33-1,RYAN>我们查了下你的司机
<33-1,RYAN>We did a little digging into that driver of yours.

861
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,160
<33-1,RYAN>发现你不是他唯一的雇主  议员先生
<33-1,RYAN>Turns out you're not his only employer, senator.

862
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,720
<33-2,ESPOSITO>我们查看了他的财务情况
<33-2,ESPOSITO>We took a look into his financials.

863

<33-3,BRACKEN>让我猜猜

868
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,590
<33-4,CASTLE>要是你就会这么干
<33-4,CASTLE>Just like you would've done.

<33-8,BECKETT>Who?

873
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,960
<33-9,BRACKEN>一个靠着给有权势的人做出承诺致富的人
<33-9,BRACKEN>Someone who's gotten rich making powerful people promises

<33-9,BRACKEN>那个人我还有用

875
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,140
<33-9,BRACKEN>当一名造王者
<33-9,BRACKEN>What does a kingmaker do

876
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,910
<33-9,BRACKEN>发现王不再听话了会怎样呢
<33-9,BRACKEN>when the king no longer follows orders?

877
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,390
<33-10,BECKETT>给我一个名字

<33-12,BECKETT>议员先生  那个人依然逍遥法外
<33-12,BECKETT>Senator, that person is still out there,

880
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,850
<33-12,BECKETT>而我却没法抓到他
<33-12,BECKETT>and I have no way of getting to him.

881
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,270
<33-12,BECKETT>你处境危险
<33-12,BECKETT>You're not safe.

882
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,440
<33-13,BRACKEN>你的关心让我很感动

883
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,870
<33-13,BRACKEN>不过恐怕你忘记了你对付的是谁
<33-13,BRACKEN>but I think maybe you forget who you're dealing with.

884
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,440
<33-14,HOWARD>先生  我们得走了
<33-14,HOWARD>Sir, we have to leave.

889
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,730
<34-3,BRACKEN>我猜这意味着我欠你个人情
<34-3,BRACKEN>I suppose this means I'm in your debt.

890
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,150
<34-4,BECKETT>我们之间没有任何改变  议员先生

<34-7,BRACKEN>如果我说不是

<34-5,BRACKEN>想要谋杀你的人是你的手下是吗
<34-5,BRACKEN>Is it true the attempt on your life was an inside job?

902
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,560
<34-6,BECKETT>有人目击到你的司机被捕了  你有何评论
<34-6,BECKETT>Witnesses say they arrested your driver. Any comment?

903
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,500
<34-7,BRACKEN>这与你的环境法案有关系吗
<34-7,BRACKEN>Did it have anything to do with your environmental initiative?

904
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,700
<34-8,HOWARD>议员先生非常繁忙
<34-8,HOWARD>Look, the senator is very busy--

908
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,280
<34-9,BRACKEN>尽管我没能在生态大会上
<34-9,BRACKEN>And though I was not able to introduce my initiative

909
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,800
<34-9,BRACKEN>介绍我的法案
<34-9,BRACKEN>at the eco conference,

910
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,320
<34-9,BRACKEN>但这件事坚定了

916
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,470
<35-2,ANNOUNCER>案件进展令人震惊
<35-2,ANNOUNCER>And in a shocking development,

917
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,500
<35-2,ANNOUNCER>联邦探员逮捕了本杰明·莫斯
<35-2,ANNOUNCER>federal agents arrested Benjamin Moss,

<35-2,ANNOUNCER>after connecting him to payments made

920
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,460
<35-2,ANNOUNCER>雇佣的联系
<35-2,ANNOUNCER>to the senator's would-be assassin.

00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,600
<35-3,CASTLE>是本·莫斯
<35-3,CASTLE>It was Ben Moss.

924
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,490
<35-4,BECKETT>最厉害的造王者
<35-4,BECKETT>The biggest kingmaker of 'em all.

925
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,740
<35-5,CASTLE>但布莱肯仅仅导致他被捕
<35-5,CASTLE>But Bracken only had him arrested.

926
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,640
<35-5,CASTLE>以他的口气  我还以为那个人
<35-5,CASTLE>The way he was talking, I half expected the guy

927
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,960
<35-5,CASTLE>会死于"空难"
<35-5,CASTLE>to die in a "Plane crash"

928
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,800
<35-5,CASTLE>或"车祸"什么的
<35-5,CASTLE>or some kind of mysterious... "Car accident."

929
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,440
<35-5,CASTLE>不
<35-5,CASTLE>No.

930
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,200
<35-6,BECKETT>这样更好
<35-6,BECKETT>This is so much better.

931
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,530
<35-6,BECKETT>现在布莱肯成了英雄
<35-6,BECKETT>Now Bracken's a folk hero.

932
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,520
<35-6,BECKETT>政客很少会为环境立法
<35-6,BECKETT>The rare politician willing to stand up to special interests

933
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,830
<35-6,BECKETT>而不顾生命危险
<35-6,BECKETT>even if it costs him his life.

934
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,630
<35-7,CASTLE>你说得对  这个故事更精彩
<35-7,CASTLE>You're right. That's a better story.

935
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,470
<35-7,CASTLE>这样的故事
<35-7,CASTLE>The kind of story

936
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,930
<35-7,CASTLE>能帮人当上总统
<35-7,CASTLE>that could make a guy president.

937
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,460
<35-8,BECKETT>总有一天他会有所疏忽
<35-8,BECKETT>He'll slip up eventually,

938
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,790
<35-8,BECKETT>而那个时候  我已准备就绪
<35-8,BECKETT>and when he does, I'll be ready.
