<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>卡塞尔先生
<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>Mr. Castle

5

<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>请注意  在跟随贝克特探长研究你下本小说的过程中  如果你受伤了
<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>Be advised, if you get injured following Detective Beckett to research your next novel,

<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>如果你中枪了 也无权起诉政府
<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>If you get shot, you cannot sue the city.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,350
<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>如果你因此丧命
<1-1,POLICE LAWYER>If you get killed--

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,800
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>我那毫无生气的遗体更无权起诉政府
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>My lifeless remains cannot sue the city.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,100
<1-3,LAWYER>是你的继承人  卡塞尔先生
<1-3,LAWYER>Your heirs, Mr. Castle.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,400
<1-4,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>我是现在就杀了他  还是等他签完协议呢
<1-4,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>Do I have to wait for him to sign, or can I shoot him now?

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,600
<1-5,LAWYER>卡塞尔先生  签弃权证书需要谨慎考虑
<1-5,LAWYER>Mr. Castle, these waivers are serious business.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,100
<1-5,LAWYER>或许向你的律师咨询一下
<1-5,LAWYER>Perhaps you'd feel more comfortable

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,200
<1-5,LAWYER>会对你比较好
<1-5,LAWYER>By referring the matter to your attorney?

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,900
<1-6,CASTLE>别开玩笑了  他怎么可能让我签这些
<1-6,CASTLE>What, are you kidding? He'd never let me sign these.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,500
<1-6,CASTLE>不过  幸好他的工作只是帮我解决麻烦
<1-6,CASTLE>But fortunately, it's his job to get me out of trouble

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
<1-6,CASTLE>我自找麻烦就与他无关
<1-6,CASTLE>And not to prevent me from getting into it.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,700
<1-7,BECKETT>好  在哪儿

00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,500
<1-7,BECKETT>好的  我马上到
<1-7,BECKETT>All right, I'm on my way.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,700
<1-8,CASTLE>等等  你要去哪儿
<1-8,CASTLE>Whoa, wait. Uh, where are you going?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
<1-10,CASTLE>-有工作要忙  -什么  我们有案子了吗
<1-10,CASTLE>- I have work to do. - What? We have a case?

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,700
<1-11,BECKETT>是我的案子  你要搞定这些文件
<1-11,BECKETT>No, I have a case. You have paperwork.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,500
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>-什么情况  -罗森伯格太太  住在9楼E
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>- So?  - Mrs. Rosenberg, 9-E here,

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>她下来想用干衣机
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>Comes down to put her clothes in the dryer,

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>但发现里面有衣服
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>Finds it's occupied.

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,300
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>一个半小时后再来  不想再等了
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>Comes down a half an hour later and she's had enough,

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,500
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>决定自己动手解决
<2-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>Decides to take matters into her own hands.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,300
<2-3,BECKETT>拜托  你是说
<2-3,BECKETT>Come on. You're telling me that

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,900
<2-3,BECKETT>一位老太太为了台干衣机杀人吗
<2-3,BECKETT>An old lady killed someone over a busy dryer?

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,900
<2-4,RYAN>什么  不是  她只是等急了
<2-4,RYAN>What? No, she's just tired of waitin' around.

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,100
<2-4,RYAN>所以她打开了干衣机
<2-4,RYAN>So she opens up the dryer

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,200
<2-4,RYAN>想把别人的衣服拿出来
<2-4,RYAN>To take the other person's clothes out,

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,800
<2-4,RYAN>却发现了这位小姐蜷在里面  浑身绒毛
<2-4,RYAN>Find Miss fluff and fold here instead.

35
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,600
<2-5,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>不要探究别人洗的衣服
<2-5,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>Now if that's not a cautionary tale

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,200
<2-5,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>如果这还不算是个警世恒言
<2-5,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>About poking around someone else's laundry,

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,750
<2-5,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>那我也搞不懂了
<2-5,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>I don't know what is.

38
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,300
<2-6,RYAN>伙计  这可是礼貌问题
<2-6,RYAN>Dude, there is an etiquette involved.

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,100
<2-6,RYAN>如果衣服干了
<2-6,RYAN>If the clothes were dry,

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,600
<2-6,RYAN>罗森伯格太太完全有权把它们放进篮子
<2-6,RYAN>Mrs. Rosenberg had every right to put 'em in the basket.

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
<2-6,RYAN>如果你想说这衣服是她折的
<2-6,RYAN>Now if you're gonna tell me that she folded 'em,

42
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,150
<2-6,RYAN>那这事有点恐怖了
<2-6,RYAN>Then it gets a little creepy.

43
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,800
<2-7,ESPOSITO>抱歉  如果有人不经我同意
<2-7,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry, someone starts rootin' around my underwear

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
<2-7,ESPOSITO>就乱翻我的内衣
<2-7,ESPOSITO>Without an invitation,

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
<2-7,ESPOSITO>那是非常非常不卫生的
<2-7,ESPOSITO>I'm taking that as a serious breach of hygiene.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,100
<2-8,BECKETT>我以为你参加突击队了   埃斯波西托
<2-8,BECKETT>I thought you went commando, Esposito.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
<2-9,ESPOSITO>季节工作
<2-9,ESPOSITO>Well... Seasonal thing.

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,100
<2-10,BECKETT>尊重死者  把她抬出来吧
<2-10,BECKETT>All right, let's get her out of there with some dignity.

49
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,400
<2-10,BECKETT>让案发现场部门过来
<2-10,BECKETT>And we need C.S.U. to come down here,

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,500
<2-10,BECKETT>漂白液的瓶子要带回实验室
<2-10,BECKETT>And the bleach bottle will have to go down to the lab,

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,800
<2-10,BECKETT>有可能有指纹和照片
<2-10,BECKETT>And probably prints and photographs,

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,200
<2-10,BECKETT>虽然不知道
<2-10,BECKETT>Although I don't know

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,100
<2-10,BECKETT>在公共场所  这些能有多大用
<2-10,BECKETT>If it's gonna do us much good in a public area.

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,000
<2-10,BECKETT>我猜她住这儿
<2-10,BECKETT>I'm guessing she lived here?

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,700
<2-11,RYAN>她在12楼F当保姆
<2-11,RYAN>Worked. 12-F. She's the nanny.

56
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,200
<2-12,CASTLE>以为把我扔在警局了  是吗
<2-12,CASTLE>Thought you ditched me back at the precinct, didn't you?

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,500
<2-12,CASTLE>别这样  干衣机里发现死去的保姆
<2-12,CASTLE>Come on. Nanny Mcdead is found on spin dry.

58
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,600
<2-12,CASTLE>你不觉得上尉会让我参与这事吗
<2-12,CASTLE>You don't think the captain's gonna let me in on that story?

59
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,400
<2-13,BECKETT>你说的对  卡塞尔
<2-13,BECKETT>You're right, Castle.

60
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,900
<2-13,BECKETT>我错了
<2-13,BECKETT>My bad.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
<2-13,BECKETT>像这样在你的阴影笼罩下办案的日子
<2-13,BECKETT>Exactly how much longer do I have to expect you

62
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,500
<2-14,CASTLE>我到底还得熬多久
<2-14,CASTLE>To be shadowing me on my cases like this?

63
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,300
<2-14,CASTLE>很难说  可能是我写新角色的时候
<2-14,CASTLE>Hard to say. When I'm writing a new character,

64
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,850
<2-14,CASTLE>但说不准灵感几时来敲门
<2-14,CASTLE>There's no telling when inspiration might strike.

65
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,400
<2-15,BECKETT>我以为我是你的灵感
<2-15,BECKETT>I thought I was your inspiration.

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
<2-16,CASTLE>你当然是了  探长  从很多方面都是
<2-16,CASTLE>Oh, you are, detective, and in so many ways.

67
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,300
<2-17,BECKETT>很快就会有灵感敲打你
<2-17,BECKETT>Yeah, well, your inspiration might strike you

68
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,600
<2-17,BECKETT>快得超乎想象
<2-17,BECKETT>Sooner than you think.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
<2-17,BECKETT>保姆的名字是莎拉·曼宁
<2-17,BECKETT>Nanny's name was Sara Manning.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,600
<2-18,CASTLE>她为彼得森一家工作了两年
<2-18,CASTLE>She worked for the Petersons about two years.

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,700
<2-18,CASTLE>门卫是我小说的狂热粉丝
<2-18,CASTLE>The doorman is a huge fan of my work.

72
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,300
<2-19,BECKETT>彼得森太太
<2-19,BECKETT>Mrs. Peterson?

73
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
<2-19,BECKETT>凯特·贝克特探长  纽约警察
<2-19,BECKETT>Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

74
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,600
<2-19,BECKETT>我能问些
<2-19,BECKETT>I was wondering if I could ask you

75
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
<2-19,BECKETT>有关莎拉·曼宁的问题吗
<2-19,BECKETT>Some questions about Sara Manning.

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
<2-20,MRS PETERSON>当然  请进
<2-20,MRS PETERSON>Of course. Please come in.

77
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,300
<2-21,BECKETT>谢谢
<2-21,BECKETT>Thank you.

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
<2-22,CASTLE>理查德·卡塞尔  只是纽约公民
<2-22,CASTLE>Richard Castle. Just N.Y.

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,500
<2-22,CASTLE>亲爱的  爸爸妈妈要和别人谈点事
<2-22,CASTLE>Sweetie, mommy and daddy need to talk to some people,

80
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,000
<2-22,CASTLE>不过我们就在这儿
<2-22,CASTLE>But we'll be right out here.

81
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,200
<2-22,CASTLE>我们还没告诉他发生了什么
<2-22,CASTLE>We still haven't told him what happened.

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
<3-1,MRS PETERSON>不知道怎么开口
<3-1,MRS PETERSON>We just don't know how.

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
<3-2,MR PETERSON>莎拉和他关系很好
<3-2,MR PETERSON>Sara was very close with him.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,700
<3-2,MR PETERSON>她天生就能和孩子们相处很好
<3-2,MR PETERSON>She just had-- has a- a gift with kids, you know?

85
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,700
<3-3,MRS PETERSON>可爱的女孩
<3-3,MRS PETERSON>She was such a lovely girl.

86
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,300
<3-4,BECKETT>-我很抱歉  -学校打电话到我的办公室
<3-4,BECKETT>- I'm very sorry.  - The school called me at my office

87
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>说莎拉没有去接贾斯廷
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>When Sara didn't come to pick up Justin.

88
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,300
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>于是我打了她的手机
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>I-I tried her cell phone,

89
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,600
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>但只转到语音信箱
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>But it went straight to voice mail.

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>然后我打了家里  但是是答录机
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>Then I tried here, but the machine picked up.

91
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,900
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>所以我叫了出租车  去了学校
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>So I hopped in a cab and went to the school.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>到家的时候  警察就已经到了
<3-5,MRS PETERSON>When we got home, the police were already here.

93
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,200
<3-6,BECKETT>最后一次看见莎拉是什么时候
<3-6,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw Sara?

94
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,500
<3-7,MRS PETERSON>我丈夫昨晚回家时见到过她
<3-7,MRS PETERSON>My husband saw her last night when he got home.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,900
<3-8,MR PETERSON>我们每天早上自己送贾斯廷去学校
<3-8,MR PETERSON>We take Justin to school every morning,

96
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,200
<3-8,MR PETERSON>所以她到这儿的时候  我们一般都不在家
<3-8,MR PETERSON>So we're usually gone by the time she gets here.

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
<3-9,BECKETT>大概是几点
<3-9,BECKETT>And what time is that?

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,100
<3-9,BECKETT>今天本该是11点的
<3-9,BECKETT>Today it would have been 11:00.

99
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,700
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>莎拉来整理下  送洗贾斯廷的衣服
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>Sara straightens up, does Justin's laundry

100
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,000
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>然后2点左右去学校接他
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>And then picks him up from school about 2:00.

101
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,500
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>我们俩有一个回家吃晚饭
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>One of us is then home for dinner.

102
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,050
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>昨天轮到我丈夫回家
<3-10,MRS PETERSON>Last night it was my husband's turn.

103
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,200
<3-11,BECKETT>那么你是最后一个见到莎拉的人了
<3-11,BECKETT>So then you were the last one to see Sara?

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,350
<3-12,MR PETERSON>我想应该是的
<3-12,MR PETERSON>I- I guess so.

105
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,000
<3-13,CASTLE>她有提到最近有什么麻烦吗
<3-13,CASTLE>Did she mention any problems she was having,

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,500
<3-13,CASTLE>-比如是男朋友  -莎拉的男朋友吗
<3-13,CASTLE>- Uh, maybe a boyfriend?  - Sara's boyfriend?

107
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,200
<3-15,MR PETERSON>门卫说
<3-15,MR PETERSON>The-- the doorman said

108
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,300
<3-15,MR PETERSON>警察认为是非法闯入
<3-15,MR PETERSON>The- the police told them that it was a break- in,

109
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,850
<3-15,MR PETERSON>那一般是由陌生人所为
<3-15,MR PETERSON>Which usually means a stranger did it.

110
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,400
<3-16,BECKETT>我们还不确定发生了什么
<3-16,BECKETT>We can't be sure what happened.

111
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
<3-17,CASTLE>可能不确定  但数据显示
<3-17,CASTLE>Well, maybe not, but statistically speaking,

112
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,100
<3-17,CASTLE>凶手很可能是她认识的人
<3-17,CASTLE>Much greater likelihood that it was someone she knew.

113
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,800
<3-18,MRS PETERSON>天啊
<3-18,MRS PETERSON>Oh, my god.

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
<3-19,BECKETT>再次申明  我们还不确定谁涉及此案
<3-19,BECKETT>Again, we can't be certain who was involved.

115
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,000
<3-21,MR PETERSON>-她是有个男朋友  -叫布兰特  但分手了
<3-21,MR PETERSON>- But she had a boyfriend.  - Brent. But they broke up.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
<3-22,CASTLE>什么时候
<3-22,CASTLE>And when was that?

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
<3-23,MRS PETERSON>一个月前  但莎拉从没说过
<3-23,MRS PETERSON>About a month ago, but Sara never said

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,850
<3-23,MRS PETERSON>这事儿有什么麻烦的
<3-23,MRS PETERSON>There was any trouble or anything like that.

119
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,100
<3-24,BECKETT>他叫布兰特吗
<3-24,BECKETT>Brent-- that was his name?

120
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,000
<3-26,BECKETT>-是的  -知道他姓什么吗
<3-26,BECKETT>- Yes.  - Do you know his last name?

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,850
<3-27,MRS PETERSON>我没听莎拉提起过
<3-27,MRS PETERSON>Uh, I don't think Sara ever mentioned it.

122
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,700
<3-28,MR PETERSON>也没和我提过
<3-28,MR PETERSON>Not to me, either.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,900
<3-29,BECKETT>谢谢两位的宝贵时间
<3-29,BECKETT>Thank you both so much for your time.

124
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,100
<3-30,MRS PETERSON>乐意效劳
<3-30,MRS PETERSON>Of course.

125
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,700
<3-31,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  走吧  -什么  就这样吗
<3-31,BECKETT>- Castle, let's go.  - But-- that's it?

126
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
<3-32,CASTLE>就这样
<3-32,CASTLE>That's it.

127
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,300
<3-33,BECKETT>你们知道有什么方法
<3-33,BECKETT>Oh, do you know of any way

128
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,700
<3-33,BECKETT>能联系莎拉的父母吗
<3-33,BECKETT>I could reach Sara's parents?

129
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,100
<3-34,MRS PETERSON>天啊  我竟然都没想过
<3-34,MRS PETERSON>Oh, god. I hadn't even thought of that.

130
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,100
<3-34,MRS PETERSON>抱歉  我们没有他们的号码
<3-34,MRS PETERSON>I- I'm sorry. We don't have their number.

131
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,350
<3-35,MR PETERSON>他们住在亚特兰大
<3-35,MR PETERSON>Yeah. They live in Atlanta.

132
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,600
<3-35,MR PETERSON>她圣诞节的时候会去陪他们
<3-35,MR PETERSON>She was with them over Christmas.

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,500
<3-36,BECKETT>莎拉有什么东西留下的吗
<3-36,BECKETT>What about Sara's things?

134
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,400
<3-37,MRS PETERSON>这是她的包和外套
<3-37,MRS PETERSON>There's her bag and her jacket.

135
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
<3-38,BECKETT>也许我能带回去  查查她的手机
<3-38,BECKETT>Maybe I could take it and check her cell phone?

136
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,000
<3-39,CASTLE>我为什么不能留下来  我还有好多问题
<3-39,CASTLE>Why couldn't me stick around? I had a lot more questions.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,100
<3-40,BECKETT>因为我喜欢自己先去调查
<3-40,BECKETT>Because I actually like to investigate things myself first.

138
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
<3-40,BECKETT>而且  他们都不会逃走的
<3-40,BECKETT>Besides, neither of them is going anywhere.

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,250
<3-40,BECKETT>手机不在这里
<3-40,BECKETT>Well, there's no cell phone in here.

140
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,200
<3-41,CASTLE>或许在洗衣房或者干衣机里
<3-41,CASTLE>Maybe it's in the laundry room or in the dryer.

141
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
<3-42,BECKETT>如果在的话  案发现场部门会找到的
<3-42,BECKETT>Well, if it is, C.S.U. will find it.

142
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,900
<3-42,BECKETT>她的证件还是乔治亚州
<3-42,BECKETT>She's still got her Georgia license.

143
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
<3-43,CASTLE>真的要由你负责通知她父母吗
<3-43,CASTLE>Are you really the one who has to call her parents?

144
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,800
<3-44,BECKETT>生活比写小说要难多了吧  卡塞尔
<3-44,BECKETT>Easier to write about than to live through, huh, Castle?

145
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,900
<4-1,CASTLE>三个男人围着台电脑
<4-1,CASTLE>Three men huddled around a computer.

146
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,300
<4-1,CASTLE>最好不是看色情片  如果是的话  算上我
<4-1,CASTLE>That better not be porn, and if it is, I want in.

147
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,800
<4-2,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>埃斯波西托和瑞恩调出了后门的
<4-2,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>Esposito and Ryan pulled security tape

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
<4-2,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>电梯监控录象
<4-2,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>From an elevator in the rear entrance.

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
<4-3,RYAN>前门的门卫24小时值班
<4-3,RYAN>Front door has a 24- Hour doorman.

150
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>这是电梯里的录象
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>This is the elevator's cam.

151
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>被害人拿着洗衣篮进了电梯
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>Our victim gets on the elevator with the laundry basket.

152
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,800
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>下去地下室
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>Takes it down to the basement,

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
<4-5,RYAN>把那孩子的衣服放进洗衣机
<4-5,RYAN>Puts the kid's clothes in the washer.

154
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,400
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>几分钟后  回到电梯
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>A few minutes later, gets back on,

155
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,200
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>直接上去  回到公寓
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>Goes all the way back up to the apartment.

156
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,400
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>40分钟后  又进了电梯
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>Then about 40 minutes later, rides the elevator back down

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,500
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>去了地下室
<4-4,ESPOSITIO>To the basement again.

158
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
<4-5,RYAN>大概是把衣服拿出来
<4-5,RYAN>Figure probably to take the kid's clothes

159
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,350
<4-5,RYAN>放到干衣机里
<4-5,RYAN>Out of the washer, put 'em in the dryer.

160
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,100
<4-6,MONTGOMERY>不过她再也没出现在镜头里
<4-6,MONTGOMERY>Camera never picks her up again.

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,400
<4-7,RYAN>之后一小时内  坐电梯去地下室的
<4-7,RYAN>Only other person to ride the elevator down all the way

162
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
<4-7,RYAN>唯一一个人  只有那位
<4-7,RYAN>To the basement during the next hour was the old lady

163
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,650
<4-7,RYAN>发现尸体的老太太
<4-7,RYAN>Who found the body.

164
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,500
<4-8,BECKETT>就是说  凶手一定是走的楼梯间
<4-8,BECKETT>So whoever attacked her must have used the stairwell,

165
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,600
<4-8,BECKETT>否则监视录象里会有他的
<4-8,BECKETT>Otherwise the camera would have caught him.

166
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,700
<4-9,RYAN>那天有三个维修工当班
<4-9,RYAN>We got three maintenance workers on duty that day.

167
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,100
<4-9,RYAN>今晚我们会查查他们
<4-9,RYAN>We'll run their names tonight.

168
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,500
<4-10,CASTLE>为什么只查工人
<4-10,CASTLE>Why only run the workers' names?

169
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,100
<4-10,CASTLE>不查查所有的邻居
<4-10,CASTLE>Why not run all the neighbors' names?

170
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,900
<4-11,BECKETT>这么说有什么根据
<4-11,BECKETT>What are you basing that on?

171
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,100
<4-11,BECKETT>根据是
<4-11,BECKETT>I'm basing that on...

172
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
<4-12,CASTLE>凶手是邻居的话  故事会更精彩
<4-12,CASTLE>The neighbor would make a better story.

173
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,800
<4-13,CASTLE>拜托  在城市里
<4-13,CASTLE>No, come on. What do any of us know

174
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,400
<4-13,CASTLE>我们有谁认识自己的邻居
<4-13,CASTLE>About our neighbors in this city?

175
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,150
<4-13,CASTLE>你觉得山姆之子(纽约州连环杀手)的邻居
<4-13,CASTLE>You think the guy living next door to the son of Sam

176
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,900
<4-13,CASTLE>会知道他住在山姆之子的隔壁吗
<4-13,CASTLE>Knew he was living next door to the son of Sam?

177
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
<4-14,MONTGOMERY>他说的对  伯科威茨(山姆之子的姓氏)住的楼
<4-14,MONTGOMERY>He's right. Neighbors in Berkowitz's building

178
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,200
<4-14,MONTGOMERY>没人知道他是连环杀手  山姆之子
<4-14,MONTGOMERY>Had no idea he was the son of Sam killer.

179
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,500
<4-15,CASTLE>谢谢  那个住在8楼B的人呢
<4-15,CASTLE>Thank you. What about the guy in 8-B?

180
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,400
<4-16,BECKETT>谁
<4-16,BECKETT>Who?

181
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
<4-16,BECKETT>8楼B的  那个安静的家伙
<4-16,BECKETT>8-B. Quiet guy.

182
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,900
<4-17,CASTLE>你每天都能见到他  但是你从没注意过他
<4-17,CASTLE>You see him every day, only you never notice him.

183
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
<4-17,CASTLE>不过他注意到了莎拉
<4-17,CASTLE>But he noticed Sara.

184
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
<5-9,CASTLE>她年轻貌美
<5-9,CASTLE>She's young, beautiful,

185
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,800
<5-10,ALEXIS>是他那样的男人
<5-10,ALEXIS>The kind of girl that a guy like him

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,700
<5-11,CASTLE>永远得不到的
<5-11,CASTLE>Would never have a chance with.

187
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,400
<5-12,ALEXIS>我们都认识这样的女孩  对不对
<5-12,ALEXIS>We all know girls like that, don't we?

188
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,700
<5-13,CASTLE>一开始这只是个游戏  查出她的行程
<5-13,CASTLE>Well, at first it's just a game. Figure out her schedule.

189
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,500
<5-14,ALEXIS>什么时间去洗衣房  什么时候形单影只
<5-14,ALEXIS>When does she do her laundry? When is she alone?

190
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,200
<5-15,CASTLE>直到事情继续发展
<5-15,CASTLE>Until it becomes something more,

191
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
<4-14,MONTGOMERY>发展到他无法控制的地步
<4-14,MONTGOMERY>Something that he can't control.

192
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
<4-15,CASTLE>很明显  他走楼梯
<4-15,CASTLE>Well, he uses the stairs, obviously,

193
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,000
<4-16,BECKETT>就逃开了电梯里的摄像头
<4-16,BECKETT>To avoid the elevator's cameras.

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
<4-17,CASTLE>然后他就藏身在阴影里
<4-17,CASTLE>And then he just waits,

195
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,100
<8-31,BRENT>等待着
<8-31,BRENT>Concealed in the shadows.

196
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
<8-32,CASTLE>她踏入洗衣房的一瞬间
<8-32,CASTLE>When she comes into that laundry room,

197
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,700
<8-33,BECKETT>他猛地扑了上来
<8-33,BECKETT>He pounces.

198
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,900
<4-17,CASTLE>他看着她那双空洞  毫无生气的眼睛
<4-17,CASTLE>When he looked into her vacant, lifeless eyes,

199
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,300
<4-17,CASTLE>他想要告诉她  他从没想过要杀她
<4-17,CASTLE>He wanted to tell her he never meant to kill her.

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,700
<4-17,CASTLE>他所想要的只是一点点注意
<4-17,CASTLE>All he ever wanted was to be noticed.

201
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,900
<4-17,CASTLE>就在那时  他的皮肤感觉到了干衣机的热度
<4-17,CASTLE>That's when he felt the heat of that dryer on his skin.

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,300
<4-17,CASTLE>他抱起她那柔软无力的身体
<4-17,CASTLE>So he picks up her limp body in his arms

203
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,000
<4-17,CASTLE>轻轻地放了进去
<4-17,CASTLE>And gently places it inside.

204
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,000
<4-17,CASTLE>当他发现口袋里的那25美分时
<4-17,CASTLE>He almost smiled at his good fortune

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,700
<4-17,CASTLE>他为自己的好运而展露微笑
<4-17,CASTLE>When he found the quarter in his pocket,

206
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
<4-17,CASTLE>悄悄把硬币放进去
<4-17,CASTLE>Slipping it into the slot.

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,600
<4-17,CASTLE>为自己争取了时间  来做他最擅长的事
<4-17,CASTLE>Buying him the time to do what he does best...

208
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,400
<4-17,CASTLE>消失
<4-17,CASTLE>Disappear.

209
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,200
<4-17,CASTLE>说说而已  更好的故事  要咖啡吗
<4-17,CASTLE>Just saying, better story. Coffee?

210
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,100
<4-18,MONTGOMERY>去查那些邻居  看有什么收获
<4-18,MONTGOMERY>Let's see what we can find out about those neighbors.

211
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,800
<4-18,MONTGOMERY>最好有人告诉我  是谁住在8楼B
<4-18,MONTGOMERY>And someone better tell me who the hell lives in 8-B.

212
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,600
<5-1,CASTLE>我猜猜  是奶奶烧的吧
<5-1,CASTLE>Let me guess. Gran cooked.

213
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,100
<5-3,CASTLE>-印度香料鸡   -飓风玛莎在哪儿
<5-3,CASTLE>- Chicken masala.  - And where is Hurricane Martha?

214
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,900
<5-4,ALEXIS>她的房间  享受着戏剧性的沉默
<5-4,ALEXIS>In her room taking a dramatic pause.

215
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,000
<5-5,CASTLE>像往常一样  把外面这堆交给别人清理
<5-5,CASTLE>Leaving the mess for everyone else to clean up, as usual.

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,100
<5-6,ALEXIS>我无所谓  晚餐很有趣
<5-6,ALEXIS>I don't mind. Dinner was fun.

217
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,700
<5-7,CASTLE>这是我们的家  不是她的
<5-7,CASTLE>Well, it's our room, not hers...

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
<5-7,CASTLE>你得记住这点
<5-7,CASTLE>Just remember.

219
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
<5-7,CASTLE>就算她买了那些无比难看的床单
<5-7,CASTLE>Even despite that hideous bedspread she bought.

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
<5-8,ALEXIS>你饿不饿  这还剩了好多饭菜
<5-8,ALEXIS>If you're hungry, there are lots of leftovers.

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,900
<5-9,CASTLE>谢谢  我在回家路上吃了
<5-9,CASTLE>Oh, thank you. I grabbed a slice on the way home.

222
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
<5-10,ALEXIS>你是真的当警察了
<5-10,ALEXIS>You really are turning into a cop.

223
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,600
<5-11,CASTLE>真的  真这么觉得
<5-11,CASTLE>Yeah?  Do you think?

224
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,100
<5-12,ALEXIS>那么今天谁遇害了
<5-12,ALEXIS>So who got killed today?

225
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
<5-13,CASTLE>一位保姆
<5-13,CASTLE>The nanny.

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,610
<5-14,ALEXIS>他们知道是谁干的吗
<5-14,ALEXIS>Do they know who did it?

227
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,500
<5-15,CASTLE>显然  在真实的谋杀案中
<5-15,CASTLE>Well, apparently in an actual homicide,

228
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,600
<5-15,CASTLE>只有抓住凶手  警察知道是谁干的
<5-15,CASTLE>They don't know who did it until after the guy gets caught.

229
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
<5-16,ALEXIS>为什么我们家从来没有保姆
<5-16,ALEXIS>How come we never had a nanny?

230
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
<5-17,CASTLE>你妈妈和我觉得
<5-17,CASTLE>Well, your mother and I decided

231
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,340
<5-17,CASTLE>如果总会有人把你教坏
<5-17,CASTLE>If someone was gonna screw you up,

232
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,700
<5-17,CASTLE>那还是让我来做吧
<5-17,CASTLE>We wanted it to be me.

233
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,560
<5-17,CASTLE>不知道为什么  你现在却是如此优秀
<5-17,CASTLE>Only you managed to turn out fine somehow anyway.

234
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,200
<5-18,ALEXIS>太出乎意料了
<5-18,ALEXIS>Surprisingly.

235
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,700
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>是不是我浪子回头的儿子
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>Is that the prodigal son I hear,

236
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,600
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>下了晚班回家了
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>Returned from working the night shift?

237
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,100
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>今天抓到嫌犯了吗  小子
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>You catch any perps today, kiddo?

238
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,550
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>我客串过一集纽约重案组  记得吗
<5-19,MARTHA RODGERS>I did an "NYPD Blue" once, remember?

239
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,100
<5-20,ALEXIS>你演的是无家可归的疯癫女人
<5-20,ALEXIS>You were the crazy homeless woman.

240
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,000
<5-21,CASTLE>而且某些人觉得她现在还是
<5-21,CASTLE>And some might say still are.

241
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,800
<5-22,ALEXIS>我刚才在问爸爸
<5-22,ALEXIS>I was just asking Dad

242
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,900
<5-22,ALEXIS>我小时候为什么没有保姆
<5-22,ALEXIS>How come we never had a nanny when I was little.

243
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,000
<5-23,CASTLE>我给她分享了我的个人经验
<5-23,CASTLE>I spared her any stories of my own personal experience.

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
<5-24,MARTHA>当时我还是全天开工的女演员
<5-24,MARTHA>I had a real job as a working actress.

245
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
<5-24,MARTHA>不是每个人都可以坐在家里
<5-24,MARTHA>You know, not everybody can sit at home

246
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
<5-24,MARTHA>整天对着电脑  就能挣钱的
<5-24,MARTHA>In front of a laptop and claim to be employed.

247
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,500
<5-25,ALEXIS>真的  你以前有保姆
<5-25,ALEXIS>Really? You had a nanny?

248
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,820
<5-26,CASTLE>对  不过我们不叫她们保姆
<5-26,CASTLE>Yeah, only we didn't call 'em nannies then.

249
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,600
<5-27,ALEXIS>那叫她们什么
<5-27,ALEXIS>What were they called?

250
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,650
<5-27,ALEXIS>我忘了
<5-27,ALEXIS>Oh, I don't know. Um...

251
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,700
<5-28,CASTLE>酒鬼
<5-28,CASTLE>Alcoholics?

252
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,200
<5-28,CASTLE>暴躁的疯子  不  等等
<5-28,CASTLE>Raving lunatics? No, no, no, wait.

253
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,800
<5-28,CASTLE>是完全不负责任的中年女人
<5-28,CASTLE>Uh, completely irresponsible middle-aged women who,

254
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
<5-28,CASTLE>在她去拍戏的时候  本应负责照看我
<5-28,CASTLE>Instead of looking after me while you were acting,

255
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,500
<5-28,CASTLE>却完全不负责任
<5-28,CASTLE>Like they were supposed to,

256
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,270
<5-28,CASTLE>大白天  只看电视
<5-28,CASTLE>Instead watched daytime television.

257
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,800
<5-29,MARTHA>别抱怨了  可你一点也没变坏啊
<5-29,MARTHA>Oh, stop your whining. You didn't turn out half bad.

258
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,270
<5-29,MARTHA>别忘了  好的那一半都是我的基因
<5-29,MARTHA>And don't forget, the good half are my genes.

259
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,160
<5-29,MARTHA>关于这点
<5-29,MARTHA>Well, that's just something we'll have to

260
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,700
<5-30,CASTLE>也只能相信你了  不是吗
<5-30,CASTLE>Take your word for, isn't it?

261
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,400
<5-30,CASTLE>妈妈  我不是要你道歉
<5-30,CASTLE>But I'm not asking for an apology, mother.

262
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
<5-30,CASTLE>事实上  我第一本小说的情节
<5-30,CASTLE>Actually, I got the plot of my first novel...

263
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,820
<5-30,CASTLE>来自于观看肥皂剧  只此一生
<5-30,CASTLE>By watching "One life to live."

264
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,500
<5-31,MARTHA>又来了
<5-31,MARTHA>There you go.

265
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
<5-32,CASTLE>贝克特探长  这么快就想我了
<5-32,CASTLE>Detective Beckett, did you miss me already?

266
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,200
<5-33,MARTHA>也就是说你的成功里
<5-33,MARTHA>Which means I am one- quarter responsible

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,130
<5-33,MARTHA>也有我四分之一的功劳
<5-33,MARTHA>For your success as well.

268
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,820
<5-34,CASTLE>真的  他们晚上做这个
<5-34,CASTLE>Really? Do they do those at night?

269
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,100
<5-34,CASTLE>不  当然来
<5-34,CASTLE>No, for sure.

270
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,900
<5-34,CASTLE>你想到我  我真是太感动了
<5-34,CASTLE>I'm just-- I'm just touched that you thought of me.

271
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,000
<5-34,CASTLE>奉命给我打电话  明白了
<5-34,CASTLE>Oh, ordered to call me? I see.

272
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,300
<5-34,CASTLE>无论如何  我马上就过来
<5-34,CASTLE>Well, either way. I, uh, can leave right away.

273
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,900
<5-34,CASTLE>好的  我得走了
<5-34,CASTLE>Okay. Gotta go.

274
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,500
<5-34,CASTLE>别等我了  11点之前睡吧
<5-34,CASTLE>I would say don't wait up, but you'll be asleep by 11:00.

275
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,320
<5-35,ALEXIS>十点半  明天要上学
<5-35,ALEXIS>10:30. It's a school night.

276
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,300
<5-36,CASTLE>你确定她有我或你的基因吗
<5-36,CASTLE>Are you sure she's got either one of our genes?

277
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,100
<5-38,CASTLE>你会帮她洗盘子的吧
<5-38,CASTLE>You will help her with the dishes?

278
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,800
<5-39,MARTHA>好的  小心点  大警察
<5-39,MARTHA>All right. Be careful... Flatfoot.

279
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
<5-39,MARTHA>来  穿上这个
<5-39,MARTHA>Here, put these on.

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,800
<6-1,BECKETT>真的吗
<6-1,BECKETT>Really?

281
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
<6-2,CASTLE>我以为警察只是站在尸体旁
<6-2,CASTLE>I thought cops just stood around the body

282
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,700
<6-2,CASTLE>边吃火腿三明治  边开玩笑而已
<6-2,CASTLE>Eating ham sandwiches and cracking jokes

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,700
<6-2,CASTLE>就是那种不适当的黑色幽默
<6-2,CASTLE>You know, hard-core gallows humor.

284
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,400
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>头部外伤无疑导致了死亡
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>The head trauma definitely contributed to the death.

285
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,500
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>猛烈的撞击
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>The force of the blows

286
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>造成严重的脑出血
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>Resulted in significant cerebral hemorrhaging.

287
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,800
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>卡塞尔先生  很高兴再次见到你
<6-3,DR LANIE PARISH>Mr. Castle, nice to see you again.

288
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,740
<6-4,CASTLE>我也很想这么说
<6-4,CASTLE>I wish I could say the same,

289
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,100
<6-4,CASTLE>不过这眼镜都有划痕了
<6-4,CASTLE>But my glasses are all scratchy.

290
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,420
<6-4,CASTLE>他们多久换一次这个
<6-4,CASTLE>How often do they let you replace these?

291
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,300
<6-5,BECKETT>不是每个人都有你那么多预算的  卡塞尔
<6-5,BECKETT>Not everybody has your budget, Castle.

292
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,520
<6-5,BECKETT>她是怎么死的
<6-5,BECKETT>So what killed her?

293
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,500
<6-6,LANIE>我认为  她是先被那瓶漂白液打中了头
<6-6,LANIE>I'd say she was struck in the head with the bleach bottle,

294
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,900
<6-6,LANIE>往前摔倒的时候  太阳穴撞到了桌角
<6-6,LANIE>Then fell forward, hit her temple on the edge of the table.

295
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,500
<6-6,LANIE>导致了颞部出血
<6-6,LANIE>That caused temporal bleeding.

296
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,300
<6-6,LANIE>因为没有急救  所以她失去了活下来的机会
<6-6,LANIE>Without medical attention, she didn't stand a chance.

297
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,900
<6-6,LANIE>不过我有你可能会感兴趣的发现
<6-6,LANIE>But what I thought you might find really interesting

298
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,300
<6-6,LANIE>她在死亡前几小时内  有过性行为
<6-6,LANIE>Is the fact that she had sex hours before her death.

299
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
<6-8,CASTLE>-性行为  -我待会儿再给你解释
<6-8,CASTLE>- Sex? - i'll explain how that works later.

300
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
<6-9,LANIE>甚至可能是在被杀前的几分钟内
<6-9,LANIE>Might have even been within a few minutes of the murder.

301
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,210
<6-9,LANIE>因为干衣机的高温  很难精确计算出时间点
<6-9,LANIE>The heat from the dryer makes it hard to pinpoint.

302
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,500
<6-10,BECKETT>你是说她被强奸了
<6-10,BECKETT>So you're saying she was raped?

303
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,400
<6-11,LANIE>很难说  并没有发现阴道撕裂
<6-11,LANIE>Hard to determine. There were no vaginal lacerations

304
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,700
<6-11,LANIE>也没有发现任何精液
<6-11,LANIE>Or presence of any semen.

305
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,300
<6-12,BECKETT>那她有过性行为的证据是
<6-12,BECKETT>So what's the evidence of sex?

306
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,900
<6-13,LANIE>微量杀精剂  那人用了避孕套
<6-13,LANIE>Traces of spermicide. The guy wore a condom.

307
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
<6-15,CASTLE>天啊  你很久没试过了吧
<6-15,CASTLE>Boy, it really has been a long time for you, hasn't it?

308
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
<6-16,LANIE>我想  可能是强奸
<6-16,LANIE>I mean, it could have been a rape,

309
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,000
<6-16,LANIE>-但我认为  -她认识那人
<6-16,LANIE>- but my best guess is... - She knew the guy.

310
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,500
<7-1,BECKETT>没有外伤的迹象
<7-1,BECKETT>Without evidence of trauma,

311
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,600
<7-1,BECKETT>我可不相信凶手进行了性侵犯
<7-1,BECKETT>I'm not ready to buy our attacker as a sexual predator,

312
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,100
<7-1,BECKETT>特别是他还用了避孕套
<7-1,BECKETT>Especially with him using a condom.

313
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
<7-2,ESPOSITO>他可能是不想让人发现DNA
<7-2,ESPOSITO>Could be he's trying to hide D.N.A.

314
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,600
<7-3,RYAN>伙计  如果有人聪明到不留下DNA
<7-3,RYAN>Dude, someone smart enough to hide D.N.A.

316
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
<7-4,CASTLE>不对  你忽略了一点
<7-4,CASTLE>No, you're missing the point.

317
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
<7-4,CASTLE>洗衣房给了他作案的机会
<7-4,CASTLE>The laundry room afforded opportunity.

318
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,200
<7-4,CASTLE>她在那里被杀不是意外
<7-4,CASTLE>It wasn't an accident she was killed there.

319
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,750
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>埃斯波西托  她的手机查得怎么样了
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>Esposito, where are we on her cell phone?

320
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,890
<7-6,ESPOSITO>我查到了她的记录
<7-6,ESPOSITO>I pulled her records,

321
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,600
<7-6,ESPOSITO>让服务商确定了一下具体位置
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Had her service provider pin it.

322
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,800
<7-6,ESPOSITO>三角定位表明  手机就在大楼内或是附近
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Triangulation puts it at or near the building.

323
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,500
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>可能他把手机抢走不让她呼救
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>Yeah, well, maybe he took it so she couldn't call for help,

324
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,880
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>再扔在附近的某处
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>Then dumped it somewhere close by.

325
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,270
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>前男友查得怎么样
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>What about her ex-boyfriend?

326
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,600
<7-8,RYAN>只知道他叫布兰特
<7-8,RYAN>We have a first name-- Brent.

327
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,640
<7-8,RYAN>如果找到手机
<7-8,RYAN>But if we had her cell phone,

328
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,690
<7-8,RYAN>电话本里应该有他
<7-8,RYAN>He might be in the address book.

329
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,500
<7-9,BECKETT>这些电话怎么回事
<7-9,BECKETT>What about these calls?

330
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,050
<7-10,CASTLE>什么电话
<7-10,CASTLE>What calls?

331
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,870
<7-11,BECKETT>过去两个月内
<7-11,BECKETT>Last two months,

332
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,500
<7-11,BECKETT>有个号码打了几十通电话进来
<7-11,BECKETT>There's dozens of incoming calls from the same number.

333
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,200
<7-12,ESPOSITO>没错  我们还在查
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Right. We're still running that down,

334
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,700
<7-12,ESPOSITO>但那个号码是预付费的
<7-12,ESPOSITO>But the number's a prepay.

335
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,000
<7-12,ESPOSITO>还有  那个号码在她遇害前几周
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Besides, those calls stopped coming

336
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,300
<7-12,ESPOSITO>就没再打来了
<7-12,ESPOSITO>A couple weeks before she was killed.

337
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,490
<7-13,BECKETT>但是死者很早就
<7-13,BECKETT>Yeah, but the outgoing calls to that number

<7-14,CASTLE>她把电话都转到了语音信箱
<7-14,CASTLE>She was letting it go to voice mail.

<8-6,BRENT>把我从公司带来的警官说
<8-6,BRENT>Um, the cops that picked me up at my job said

<8-6,BRENT>你们想问我关于莎拉的事
<8-6,BRENT>You had some questions about what happened to Sara.

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,500
<8-9,BECKETT>一个月前  后来发生了什么
<8-9,BECKETT>A month ago? What happened then?

<8-10,BRENT>-没什么  我们分手了  -谁提出来的

354
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,370
<8-12,BRENT>是双方都这么想的
<8-12,BRENT>It was a mutual thing, I guess.

355
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,130
<8-13,BECKETT>双方
<8-13,BECKETT>A mutual thing?

356

<8-14,BRENT>莎拉  是我  打给我好吗
<8-14,BRENT>Hey, Sara, it's me. Well, just call me back, okay?

357
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,400
<8-14,BRENT>你不能不回我电话  莎拉  别犯贱了
<8-14,BRENT>You can't just not call me  back, Sara. Don't be a bitch.

<8-14,BRENT>别这样  莎拉  我只想和你谈谈
<8-14,BRENT>Come on, Sara, I just want to talk to you.

<8-14,BRENT>听着  我不知道你为什么不肯告诉我
<8-14,BRENT>Look, I don't know why you can't just tell me

360
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
<8-14,BRENT>那家伙到底是谁
<8-14,BRENT>Who this other guy is.

361

<8-14,BRENT>你知道吗  你就是个荡妇
<8-14,BRENT>You know... You know what? You're just a little slut.

362
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,560
<8-15,BECKETT>还有很多这样的留言
<8-15,BECKETT>There's plenty more of those.

363
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,300
<8-16,CASTLE>让亚历克·鲍德温的留言(影星怒骂女儿被曝)
<8-16,CASTLE>Yep. They make Alec Baldwin's messages

364
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,870
<8-16,CASTLE>听着像是美好的童话故事
<8-16,CASTLE>Sound like rainbows and unicorns.

365
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,900
<8-17,BRENT>你们怎么弄到这些的
<8-17,BRENT>How did you get those?

366
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,600
<8-18,BECKETT>-从你的服务商那里  -给个小建议
<8-18,BECKETT>- From your service provider. - A little advice--

367
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
<8-19,CASTLE>你买预付费手机的时候  别刷信用卡
<8-19,CASTLE>When you buy a prepaid phone, don't use your credit card.

368
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,740
<8-19,CASTLE>因为那是会被追查到的
<8-19,CASTLE>Makes it totally traceable.

369
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,100
<8-20,BRENT>我没想隐瞒任何事
<8-20,BRENT>I wasn't trying to hide anything.

370
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,200
<8-21,BECKETT>没有吗  那你为什么要撒谎
<8-21,BECKETT>No? Then why did you just lie to me?

371
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
<8-22,CASTLE>因为没有一个男人愿意被甩
<8-22,CASTLE>'Cause no man likes getting dumped.

372
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,500
<8-22,CASTLE>我说的对吗  我们的自尊心无法面对
<8-22,CASTLE>Am I right? Our egos can't handle it.

373
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,600
<8-22,CASTLE>有一次  我的前女友对我不忠
<8-22,CASTLE>This one time I had an ex-girlfriend cheat on me,

374
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,430
<8-22,CASTLE>我整整一星期都醉醺醺的
<8-22,CASTLE>I drank every meal for a week.

375
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,700
<8-22,CASTLE>我甚至都没喜欢过她
<8-22,CASTLE>I didn't even like her.

376
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,500
<8-22,CASTLE>要是我真的爱上她  天啊  我不知道
<8-22,CASTLE>If I had loved her? Wow. I don't know...

377
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,900
<8-22,CASTLE>会做出什么事来
<8-22,CASTLE>What I would have done.

378
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,700
<8-23,BRENT>不  不是这样的
<8-23,BRENT>No, no. No way. It wasn't like that.

379
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
<8-24,BECKETT>不是  如果你们在一个月之前就分手了
<8-24,BECKETT>Oh, no. So then how did you find out about Sara

380
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,940
<8-24,BECKETT>那你是怎么找到莎拉的
<8-24,BECKETT>If you two broke up a month ago?

381
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,600
<8-25,BRENT>一个朋友帮忙的  克洛伊  克洛伊·理查森
<8-25,BRENT>From a friend. Chloe. Chloe Richardson.

382
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
<8-25,BRENT>我们是大学同学
<8-25,BRENT>All right? We all went to college together.

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,710
<8-25,BRENT>就是克洛伊帮莎拉找到工作的
<8-25,BRENT>Chloe's the one who got Sara her job.

384
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,200
<8-26,BECKETT>这个朋友怎么找到她的
<8-26,BECKETT>And how did this friend find out?

385
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,400
<8-27,BRENT>克洛伊在那栋楼的另一户人家做保姆
<8-27,BRENT>Chloe nannies for another family in the building.

386
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,170
<8-27,BRENT>她们俩关系很好
<8-27,BRENT>The two of 'em are pretty close.

387
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,900
<8-28,BECKETT>莎拉被害那天  你在哪里
<8-28,BECKETT>So then where were you the day that Sara got killed?

388
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,300
<8-29,BRENT>我就在警察找到我的地方  在上班
<8-29,BRENT>I was where those other cops found me, at my job.

389
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,500
<8-29,BRENT>那里有监视器
<8-29,BRENT>Look, we have video cameras there

390
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
<8-29,BRENT>还有签到表
<8-29,BRENT>And a sign-in sheet.

391
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,000
<8-29,BRENT>我和这事毫无关系
<8-29,BRENT>Look, I didn't have anything to do with this.

392
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,100
<8-29,BRENT>我被捕了吗
<8-29,BRENT>Am I under arrest or something?

393
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,100
<8-30,BECKETT>没有  你可以走了
<8-30,BECKETT>No. You can go.

394
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,820
<8-30,BECKETT>不过  在我们下次见面之前别出城
<8-30,BECKETT>But... Just don't leave town until we speak again.

395
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,930
<8-30,BECKETT>明白吗
<8-30,BECKETT>Do you understand?

396
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,700
<8-31,BRENT>是的  警官
<8-31,BRENT>Yeah. Yes, Ma'am.

397
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
<8-31,BRENT>别出城
<8-31,BRENT>"Don't leave town"?

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,100
<8-32,CASTLE>不是需要正当理由才能那样说吗
<8-32,CASTLE>Don't you need probable cause for something like that?

399
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,100
<8-33,BECKETT>但他不知道  不是吗
<8-33,BECKETT>Only he doesn't know that, does he?

400
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,020
<8-34,CASTLE>你可以那样撒谎  太酷了
<8-34,CASTLE>You can lie like that? That is so cool.

401
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,700
<8-35,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<8-35,BECKETT>Castle.

402
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,310
<9-1,BECKETT>门卫告诉埃斯波西托这是个儿童游乐场
<9-1,BECKETT>Doorman told Esposito that this is the playground

403
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,170
<9-1,BECKETT>这栋楼的所有保姆都会来这儿
<9-1,BECKETT>That all the nannies of the building go to.

404
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,530
<9-1,BECKETT>我们应该能在这儿找到克洛伊
<9-1,BECKETT>So hopefully we find Chloe here.

405
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,190
<9-2,CASTLE>这让我想起不久的过去
<9-2,CASTLE>This brings me back a bit.

406
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,540
<9-3,BECKETT>不久  应该是很久吧  卡塞尔
<9-3,BECKETT>A bit? I'm thinking it's a little more than that, Castle.

407
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,100
<9-4,CASTLE>我不是说我小的时候
<9-4,CASTLE>I wasn't talking about when I was a kid.

408
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,700
<9-4,CASTLE>我是说
<9-4,CASTLE>I'm talking about

409
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,230
<9-4,CASTLE>以前常带我女儿去公园
<9-4,CASTLE>When I used to take my daughter to the park.

410
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,700
<9-5,BECKETT>你经常带女儿去公园
<9-5,BECKETT>You used to take your daughter to the park?

411
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
<9-6,CASTLE>春天夏天秋天  我们每天都去
<9-6,CASTLE>Spring, summer, fall. We were here every day.

412
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
<9-6,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯的妈妈在社区剧院工作
<9-6,CASTLE>Alexis' mom was doing community theater.

413
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,500
<9-6,CASTLE>她经常出差  所以我照顾孩子  怎么了
<9-6,CASTLE>She was on the road a lot, so I had custody. What?

414
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,100
<9-7,BECKETT>没什么  只是没想到你还是奶爸一族
<9-7,BECKETT>Nothing. I just never figured you for Mr. Mom.

415
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,100
<9-8,CASTLE>那是我人生中最快乐的日子
<9-8,CASTLE>Some of the best days of my life.

416

<9-9,BECKETT>-好像还真不错  -跟我说说
<9-9,BECKETT>- That's actually kind of nice. - Yeah, tell me about it.

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
<9-10,CASTLE>你知道在曼哈顿的儿童游乐场里
<9-10,CASTLE>Do you know how many lonely single mothers there are

418
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
<9-10,CASTLE>有多少孤独的单身母亲吗
<9-10,CASTLE>On a Manhattan playground?

419
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,020
<9-10,CASTLE>没有婚姻的日子里  我也在那里
<9-10,CASTLE>And there I was, between marriages.

420
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,000
<9-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你到底结过几次婚
<9-11,BECKETT>Exactly how many times have you been married, Castle?

421
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,400
<9-13,BECKETT>-两次  -没了
<9-13,BECKETT>- Twice. - That's it?

422
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,100
<9-14,CASTLE>不够吗  你呢
<9-14,CASTLE>Isn't that enough? How about you?

423
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
<9-15,BECKETT>我  从来没有
<9-15,BECKETT>Me? No, never been.

<9-16,CASTLE>- Really?  - Yeah.

425
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,800
<9-17,BECKETT>你应该很在行才对
<9-17,BECKETT>You'd be good at it.

426
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
<9-18,CASTLE>你有控制欲  还满腹不满
<9-18,CASTLE>You're both controlling and disapproving.

427
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,230
<9-18,CASTLE>你真该试试
<9-18,CASTLE>You should really try it.

428
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,460
<9-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不认为第一次的失败
<9-19,BECKETT>I'm not an "if defeated at first,

429
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,700
<9-19,BECKETT>等于永远失败
<9-19,BECKETT>You don't succeed" kind of a girl, Castle.

430
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,800
<9-19,BECKETT>但在婚姻上
<9-19,BECKETT>When it comes to marriage,

431
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,100
<9-19,BECKETT>我更相信打一场赢一场
<9-19,BECKETT>I'm more of a "one and done" type.

432
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,600
<9-20,CASTLE>有中意的候选人了吗
<9-20,CASTLE>Any serious candidates?

<9-21,BECKETT>门卫说她穿了件红色马甲
<9-21,BECKETT>The doorman said she'd have a red vest on.

435
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,000
<9-21,BECKETT>应该就是她了
<9-21,BECKETT>That might be our girl.

<9-28,CHLOE>听说彼得森一家想找保姆
<9-28,CHLOE>And heard that the Petersons were looking for someone.

450
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,500
<9-29,CASTLE>你最后一次见莎拉是什么时候
<9-29,CASTLE>When was the last time you saw Sara?

<9-30,BECKETT>克洛伊  我明白失去朋友的感觉
<9-30,BECKETT>I know what it feels like to lose somebody, Chloe,

452
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,700
<9-30,BECKETT>但我们必须问你这些问题
<9-30,BECKETT>But we need to ask you these questions.

453
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,350
<9-31,CHLOE>有时候我们在上班前先碰头
<9-31,CHLOE>Um, sometimes we'd meet up before work,

454
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,600
<9-31,CHLOE>一起去哥伦布咖啡店买咖啡
<9-31,CHLOE>Get a coffee on Columbus

455
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,900
<9-31,CHLOE>然后一起走去上班
<9-31,CHLOE>And then walk over to work together.

456
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,700
<9-32,BECKETT>-那天你们去买咖啡了吗  -是的
<9-32,BECKETT>- Did you get coffee that day?  - Yeah.

457
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,250
<9-33,CHLOE>她对你说过什么吗
<9-33,CHLOE>Did she say anything to you?

458
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,750
<9-34,CASTLE>她有没看起来心烦  或者
<9-34,CASTLE>Did she seem upset? Or...

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,750
<9-35,CHLOE>心烦  烦什么
<9-35,CHLOE>Upset? Upset about what?

460
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,450
<9-36,BECKETT>布兰特告诉我们
<9-36,BECKETT>Brent gave us the impression

461
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,550
<9-36,BECKETT>说莎拉正在和别人约会
<9-36,BECKETT>That Sara was seeing someone else.

462
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,450
<9-37,CASTLE>你肯定知道是谁  对吗
<9-37,CASTLE>You know who it was, don't you?

463
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,050
<9-38,CHLOE>有时候莎拉会待到很晚
<9-38,CHLOE>Sometimes Sara would stay late.

464
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,050
<9-39,BECKETT>在哪儿待到很晚  彼得森家吗
<9-39,BECKETT>Stay late where, at the Petersons'?

465
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,050
<9-39,BECKETT>对  我们差不多同时下班
<9-39,BECKETT>Yeah, we got off work around the same time,

466
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,150
<9-40,CHLOE>所以我们一起坐地铁回家
<9-40,CHLOE>So we'd take the train home together.

467
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,550
<9-40,CHLOE>我和别人合租  离莎拉的住处只有几个街区
<9-40,CHLOE>I live with a roommate a couple blocks from Sara.

468
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,450
<9-40,CHLOE>只是最近几个月  她总是很晚才走
<9-40,CHLOE>Only the last few months, she'd been staying late.

469
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,850
<9-40,CHLOE>彼得森太太和她丈夫轮流
<9-40,CHLOE>Mr. And Mrs. Peterson kind of take turns

470
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,650
<9-40,CHLOE>回家吃饭
<9-40,CHLOE>Coming home for dinner, you know?

471
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,550
<9-41,BECKETT>是的  彼得森太太告诉我们了
<9-41,BECKETT>Yeah, Mrs. Peterson told us.

472
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,050
<9-42,CHLOE>天啊  我真的不想说这些
<9-42,CHLOE>God. I- I don't want to say something, and then...

473
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,650
<9-42,CHLOE>我是说  他已经结婚了
<9-42,CHLOE>I mean-- I mean, he's married.

474
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,250
<9-43,BECKETT>等一下  莎拉告诉过你他的事
<9-43,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Sara told you about him?

475
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,350
<9-44,CHLOE>没有  没有明说  只是
<9-44,CHLOE>No. No, not exactly. It's just...

476
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,850
<9-44,CHLOE>彼得森太太不回家吃饭的那些晚上
<9-44,CHLOE>The nights Mrs. Peterson didn't come home for dinner...

477
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,250
<9-44,CHLOE>就是莎拉晚下班的时候
<9-44,CHLOE>Those were the only nights Sara stayed late.

479
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:21,850
<10-1,CASTLE>我也说过
<10-1,CASTLE>And I told you

480
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,650
<10-2,BECKETT>我喜欢先了解情况
<10-2,BECKETT>That I like to question my most likely suspects

481
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,890
<10-2,BECKETT>再盘问我觉得最有嫌疑的人
<10-2,BECKETT>After I know more about them.

482
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,930
<10-2,BECKETT>那样就会得到更加具体的答案
<10-2,BECKETT>That way they're tied to more specific answers.

483
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,760
<10-3,CASTLE>你也怀疑是他
<10-3,CASTLE>You suspected him, too?

484
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,180
<10-4,BECKETT>丈夫吗  当然
<10-4,BECKETT>The husband? Duh.

<10-7,CASTLE>We could always make it strip poker.

490
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,920
<10-8,BECKETT>不好意思  比起神秘我更喜欢恐怖
<10-8,BECKETT>Sorry, but I prefer mystery to horror.

<13-1,BECKETT>You weren't at the office

559
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,700
<13-1,BECKETT>你不在你的办公室  是吗
<13-1,BECKETT>The day Sara Manning was killed, were you?

560
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
<13-1,BECKETT>你对我们说了谎  彼得森太太
<13-1,BECKETT>You lied to me, Mrs. Peterson.

561
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
<13-1,BECKETT>瑞恩警官跟你儿子的学校核实过
<13-1,BECKETT>Detective Ryan checked with your son's school.

562
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,300
<13-1,BECKETT>那天他们打电话通知你莎拉没去学校
<13-1,BECKETT>The day they called about Sara not showing up,

563
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,090
<13-1,BECKETT>你的助手说和你联系不上
<13-1,BECKETT>Your assistant said that you were unreachable.

564
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,700
<13-2,MRS PETERSON>你们在说什么
<13-2,MRS PETERSON>What are you talking about?

565
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,500
<13-3,BECKETT>我在说莎拉·曼宁的事  彼得森太太
<13-3,BECKETT>I'm talking about Sara Manning, Mrs. Peterson.

566
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,900
<13-3,BECKETT>在说你为什么要说谎
<13-3,BECKETT>We're talking about why you lied

567
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,600
<13-3,BECKETT>以及那天你究竟身处何地
<13-3,BECKETT>About where you were the day she was killed.

568
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,380
<13-3,BECKETT>我们已经知道你不在办公室
<13-3,BECKETT>And we know you weren't in your office.

569
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,600
<13-4,CASTLE>你可以很容易偷偷溜进大楼
<13-4,CASTLE>It would have been easy to sneak into the building.

570
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,110
<13-4,CASTLE>可能趁门卫出去
<13-4,CASTLE>Doorman could have been outside

571
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,420
<13-4,CASTLE>叫出租车或是收包裹
<13-4,CASTLE>Hailing a cab, taking a delivery

572
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:47,800
<13-4,CASTLE>等等
<13-4,CASTLE>Wait...

573
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,800
<13-5,MRS PETERSON>我丈夫有外遇
<13-5,MRS PETERSON>My husband is having an affair.

574
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,000
<13-5,MRS PETERSON>你们知道吗
<13-5,MRS PETERSON>Did you know that?

575
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,900
<13-6,CASTLE>事实上  我们已经知道了
<13-6,CASTLE>Actually, we did.

576
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,900
<13-7,MRS PETERSON>好几个月了  我居然都不知道
<13-7,MRS PETERSON>All these months, I had no idea.

577
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,270
<13-8,BECKETT>但是后来你发现了
<13-8,BECKETT>But then you found out.

578
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,100
<13-9,MRS PETERSON>对  莎拉几星期前告诉我的
<13-9,MRS PETERSON>Yeah, Sara told me a few weeks ago.

579
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,200
<13-10,BECKETT>莎拉告诉你这件事的
<13-10,BECKETT>Sara told you about the affair?

580
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,810
<13-11,MRS PETERSON>对  她为了瞒着我
<13-11,MRS PETERSON>Yes, and she'd been an absolute wreck

581
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,420
<13-11,MRS PETERSON>搞得神经紧张
<13-11,MRS PETERSON>About keeping it from me.

582
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,500
<13-12,CASTLE>是啊  肯定是这样
<13-12,CASTLE>Yeah, I bet she was.

583
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
<13-13,MRS PETERSON>你们知道他额外付给她钱吗
<13-13,MRS PETERSON>Did you know he was paying her extra?

584
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
<13-14,BECKETT>不  他没提到
<13-14,BECKETT>No, he didn't mention that.

585
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,420
<13-15,MRS PETERSON>真无法想象居然让莎拉做这种事
<13-15,MRS PETERSON>Imagine putting Sara in the middle of something like that.

586
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,000
<13-16,BECKETT>什么事
<13-16,BECKETT>Something like what?

587
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
<13-17,MRS PETERSON>让莎拉帮他打掩护
<13-17,MRS PETERSON>Well, using Sara to cover for himself.

588
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,320
<13-17,MRS PETERSON>太恶心了
<13-17,MRS PETERSON>I mean, it's disgusting.

589
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,900
<13-18,BECKETT>我不明白  彼得森太太
<13-18,BECKETT>I don't understand, Mrs. Peterson.

590
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,500
<13-18,BECKETT>如果你和莎拉的死毫无关系
<13-18,BECKETT>If you had nothing to do with Sara's death,

591
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,100
<13-18,BECKETT>那为什么撒谎
<13-18,BECKETT>Then why would you lie?

592
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,700
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>因为我那出轨的丈夫
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>Because my cheating husband has no idea

593
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,400
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>完全不知道我准备跟他离婚
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>I'm about to serve him with divorce papers.

594
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,900
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>我说谎  是因为当时我在律师那里
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>I lied because I was at my lawyer's that afternoon.

595
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,700
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>不是只有霍华德才有秘密
<13-19,MRS PETERSON>Howard's not the only one who can keep a secret.

596
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,900
<14-1,MARTHA>你好
<14-1,MARTHA>Hello there!

597
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,100
<14-1,MARTHA>在忙什么呢
<14-1,MARTHA>What are you up to?

598
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,300
<14-2,CASTLE>没什么
<14-2,CASTLE>Nothing.

599
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
<14-3,MARTHA>我希望不是又在视频聊天啊
<14-3,MARTHA>You're not webcamming again, I hope.

600
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,900
<14-4,CASTLE>我把监控录像刻成了DVD
<14-4,CASTLE>I burned a DVD from security cameras...

601
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,380
<14-4,CASTLE>是警方在调查的证物
<14-4,CASTLE>That the police are looking at.

602
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,000
<14-4,CASTLE>而且我从来没视频聊天
<14-4,CASTLE>And I’ve never webcammed.

603
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,900
<14-5,MARTHA>那是你的说法  你还要坚持是吧
<14-5,MARTHA>That's your story, and you're sticking to it, huh?

604
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,700
<14-5,MARTHA>警察会让你把证物刻成DVD
<14-5,MARTHA>The police just let you burn a DVD?

605
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,710
<14-5,MARTHA>你该意识到
<14-5,MARTHA>You do realize you're gonna

606
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,800
<14-5,MARTHA>不能再偷警方的证据了吧
<14-5,MARTHA>Have to stop stealing evidence, right?

607
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,050
<14-5,MARTHA>我以为  你之所以跟着
<14-5,MARTHA>I thought the whole purpose of following

608
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,300
<14-5,MARTHA>这个女警探
<14-5,MARTHA>This detective around

609
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,710
<14-5,MARTHA>只是为了帮助你写作
<14-5,MARTHA>Was to help you to write.

610
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,400
<14-6,CASTLE>这叫研究  妈妈
<14-6,CASTLE>It's called research, mother.

611
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,300
<14-7,MARTHA>好吧  你最好希望
<14-7,MARTHA>Well, you'd better hope

612
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,200
<14-7,MARTHA>德里克·斯道姆系列最后一本能大卖  亲爱的
<14-7,MARTHA>This last Derrick Storm book sells, lover boy,

613
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,500
<14-7,MARTHA>因为研究可不能用来付  账单
<14-7,MARTHA>Because research don't pay the... Bills.

614
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,200
<14-7,MARTHA>这是那个保姆吗
<14-7,MARTHA>Is that the nanny?

615
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,800
<14-9,MARTHA>有哪个正常的已婚女人
<14-9,MARTHA>What married woman in her right mind

616
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
<14-9,MARTHA>会把这样漂亮的女孩带回家
<14-9,MARTHA>Invites a girl that pretty into her own home?

617
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,750
<14-12,ALEXIS>你们在看什么
<14-12,ALEXIS>What are you guys watching?

618
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,400
<14-13,CASTLE>我在看  她在搅和
<14-13,CASTLE>I'm watching. She's butting in.

619
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
<14-13,CASTLE>警方找不到保姆的手机
<14-13,CASTLE>The police can't find the nanny's cell phone.

620
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,700
<14-13,CASTLE>他们觉得上面可能会有罪犯的指纹
<14-13,CASTLE>They were hoping to lift some fingerprints from it.

621
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,400
<14-13,CASTLE>看得到她下楼去洗衣房时
<14-13,CASTLE>I just thought I could see it she had it with her

622
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,350
<14-13,CASTLE>是拿着手机的
<14-13,CASTLE>When she went down to the laundry room.

623
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,350
<14-14,MARTHA>然后呢
<14-14,MARTHA>And?

624
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,450
<14-15,CASTLE>拿衣服送洗时
<14-15,CASTLE>It's in her hand

625
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,100
<14-15,CASTLE>手机就在手里
<14-15,CASTLE>The first time she brings the clothes down to the wash,

626
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,400
<14-15,CASTLE>要去烘干衣服的时候
<14-15,CASTLE>But then she doesn't have it

627
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,770
<14-15,CASTLE>手机却不在了
<14-15,CASTLE>When she goes down to use the dryer.

628
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,400
<14-16,ALEXIS>所以  她可能把手机
<14-16,ALEXIS>So... She probably left it

629
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,700
<14-16,ALEXIS>丢在楼上她工作的那家了
<14-16,ALEXIS>Upstairs in the apartment where she worked.

630
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,300
<14-17,CASTLE>他们说找不到  等等
<14-17,CASTLE>They say they can't fi... Find it. Wait a sec.

631
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,300
<14-18,ALEXIS>什么
<14-18,ALEXIS>What?

632
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
<14-19,CASTLE>这当中有5秒钟的差别
<14-19,CASTLE>There's a 5- second time difference.

633
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,200
<14-20,MARTHA>什么5秒钟的差别
<14-20,MARTHA>A 5-Second time difference in what?

634
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,900
<14-21,CASTLE>她两次乘电梯去地下室
<14-21,CASTLE>She rides the elevator twice to the basement.

635
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,400
<14-21,CASTLE>第一次是去洗衣服
<14-21,CASTLE>The first time to put the clothes in the washer,

636
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
<14-21,CASTLE>第二次是去烘干衣服
<14-21,CASTLE>The second time to put them in the dryer.

637
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,450
<14-21,CASTLE>但是第二次下楼
<14-21,CASTLE>Only the second time,

638
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,900
<14-21,CASTLE>她多花了5秒
<14-21,CASTLE>The trip takes her five seconds longer.

639
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,510
<14-22,ALEXIS>为什么一样的路程要多花时间
<14-22,ALEXIS>Why would it take her longer to travel the same distance?

640
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,300
<14-23,CASTLE>不会的
<14-23,CASTLE>It wouldn't.

641
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,930
<15-1,BECKETT>我不明白你要干什么  卡塞尔
<15-1,BECKETT>I'm not quite sure where you're going with this, Castle.

642
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,600
<15-1,BECKETT>好的  32秒
<15-1,BECKETT>All right, 32 seconds.

643
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,520
<15-2,CASTLE>花了32秒钟
<15-2,CASTLE>It takes 32 seconds

644
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,200
<15-2,CASTLE>从地下室到12楼
<15-2,CASTLE>To get from the basement to the 12th floor.

645
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,900
<15-3,BECKETT>太好了  我会布告天下
<15-3,BECKETT>Great. I'll alert the media.

646
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,200
<15-4,CASTLE>但是第二次  她花了37秒
<15-4,CASTLE>Only the second time, it took her 37 seconds.

647
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,220
<15-5,BECKETT>为什么会多出5秒
<15-5,BECKETT>Why would it take her five extra seconds?

648
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,100
<15-6,CASTLE>因为第二次
<15-6,CASTLE>Because the second time,

649
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,800
<15-6,CASTLE>她不是从12楼下去的
<15-6,CASTLE>She wasn't coming from the 12th floor.

650
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,500
<15-6,CASTLE>她应该是从
<15-6,CASTLE>She was coming from the...

651
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,060
<15-7,BECKETT>15楼
<15-7,BECKETT>15th floor?

652
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,160
<15-7,BECKETT>这说不通啊  彼得森一家住在12楼
<15-7,BECKETT>This doesn't make any sense. The Petersons live on 12.

653
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
<15-8,CASTLE>不过我敢肯定  用避孕套的人就住在15楼
<15-8,CASTLE>Yeah, but I bet the guy who wears that condom lives on 15.

654
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,200
<15-8,CASTLE>顺便说一句  乘电梯的事
<15-8,CASTLE>By the way, that whole elevator thing?

655
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,900
<15-8,CASTLE>我这么做  是因为你身上的清香
<15-8,CASTLE>I just did that 'cause you smell nice.

656
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,630
<15-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不能就这样敲别人的门
<15-9,BECKETT>Castle, you can't just knock on people's doors.

657
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,000
<15-10,CASTLE>为什么不行
<15-10,CASTLE>Why not?

658
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,900
<15-11,OLD GUY>谁啊
<15-11,OLD GUY>Who is it?

659
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,700
<15-12,BECKETT>因为你会吓着他们的
<15-12,BECKETT>Because you're gonna freak them out.

660
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,900
<15-12,BECKETT>警察

<15-15,OLD GUY>对  你为什么问这个
<15-15,OLD GUY>Yeah. Why you wanna know?

665
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,790
<15-16,CASTLE>别担心  你不够年轻
<15-16,CASTLE>Uh, don't worry about it. You're not young enough.

666
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,500
<15-17,OLD GUY>什么不够年轻
<15-17,OLD GUY>Young enough for what?

667
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,320
<15-18,CASTLE>做爱
<15-18,CASTLE>To have sex.

<15-19,OLD GUY>你们到底算什么警察
<15-19,OLD GUY>Uh, what kind of cops did you say you were?

<15-23,OLD GUY>77岁也不是没可能啊  知道吗
<15-23,OLD GUY>77 ain't beyond the realm of possibility, ya know?

674
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,900
<15-24,BECKETT>请问  这小女孩是贝佳吗
<15-24,BECKETT>Pardon me, is this little girl Becca?

675
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
<16-1,MRS HARRIS>对不起  我不太明白
<16-1,MRS HARRIS>I'm sorry. I'm not sure I'm following.

676
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
<16-2,BECKETT>我们认为在莎拉·曼宁遇害前
<16-2,BECKETT>Prior to her murder,

677
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,900
<16-2,BECKETT>她是从这层楼下楼的
<16-2,BECKETT>We believe that Sara Manning was coming from this floor.

678
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,900
<16-3,MRS HARRIS>我不清楚  我那天上班
<16-3,MRS HARRIS>Well, I don't know anything about that. I was at work.

679
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,630
<16-3,MRS HARRIS>可能她上来看克洛伊
<16-3,MRS HARRIS>Maybe she came up to see Chloe?

680
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,600
<16-4,BECKETT>克洛伊·理查森
<16-4,BECKETT>Chloe Richardson?

681
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
<16-5,MRS HARRIS>她和莎拉是好朋友
<16-5,MRS HARRIS>She and Sara were friends,

682
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
<16-5,MRS HARRIS>有时两家的孩子一起过玩伴日
<16-5,MRS HARRIS>And our kids get together sometimes for playdates.

683
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,100
<16-6,MR HARRIS>亲爱的  怎么了  我以为你出去了
<16-6,MR HARRIS>Hey, babe. What's going on? I thought you were going out.

684
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,600
<16-7,MRS HARRIS>-这是警察  -警察
<16-7,MRS HARRIS>- It's the police. - Police?

685
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
<16-8,MR HARRIS>他们认为克洛伊的朋友莎拉  在被害那天
<16-8,MR HARRIS>They think Chloe's friend Sara might've been up here

686
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,800
<16-9,MRS HARRIS>可能上来过
<16-9,MRS HARRIS>The day she was killed.

687
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,300
<16-9,MRS HARRIS>等等  你那天在家  对吧
<16-9,MRS HARRIS>Wait, you were home that day, right? .

688
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,700
<16-10,MR HARRIS>是哪天啊
<16-10,MR HARRIS>Um... What day was that?

689
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
<16-11,BECKETT>星期二
<16-11,BECKETT>Tuesday.

690
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,600
<16-12,MR HARRIS>没错  我是在家
<16-12,MR HARRIS>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I was... I was... I was here.

691
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,700
<16-13,BECKETT>那你看见莎拉了吗
<16-13,BECKETT>So did you see Sara?

692
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,310
<16-14,MR HARRIS>我想没有  没有
<16-14,MR HARRIS>I don't think so. No.

693
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,700
<16-15,BECKETT>你想没有
<16-15,BECKETT>You don't think so?

694
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,000
<16-16,MR HARRIS>是的
<16-16,MR HARRIS>No.

695
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,680
<16-17,CASTLE>介意我用下洗手间吗
<16-17,CASTLE>Mind if I use your bathroom?

696
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,200
<16-17,CASTLE>人们从来没想过警察也是人
<16-17,CASTLE>People never think about that.

697
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,700
<16-17,CASTLE>警察什么时候上厕所
<16-17,CASTLE>When do cops use the bathroom?

698
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
<16-18,MRS HARRIS>-就在那里  -谢谢
<16-18,MRS HARRIS>- It's right there. - Thank you.

699
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,800
<16-20,BECKETT>那么  星期二
<16-20,BECKETT>So... Tuesday.

700
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
<16-21,MR HARRIS>对  让我想想
<16-21,MR HARRIS>Oh, yeah, yeah. Let me think a minute. Um...

701
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,400
<16-22,BECKETT>这么说你不能确定是有还是没有
<16-22,BECKETT>So you're saying that you can't say one way or the other?

702
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,800
<16-23,MR HARRIS>克洛伊来照顾贝佳以后
<16-23,MR HARRIS>After Chloe got here to take care of Becca,

703
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
<16-23,MR HARRIS>我就进房小睡了一会儿
<16-23,MR HARRIS>I went inside to take a nap.

704
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,700
<16-23,MR HARRIS>我都是晚上工作
<16-23,MR HARRIS>I work most nights.

705
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,400
<16-24,CASTLE>避孕套
<16-24,CASTLE>Condoms.

706
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,400
<16-25,BECKETT>哈里斯先生  您是做什么的
<16-25,BECKETT>And what is it that you do, Mr. Harris?

707
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,700
<16-26,MR HARRIS>我是个音乐家
<16-26,MR HARRIS>Oh, I'm a musician.

708
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,900
<16-27,CASTLE>洗手间里有避孕套
<16-27,CASTLE>Condoms in the bathroom.

709
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,800
<16-28,MR HARRIS>所以  有可能莎拉上来过
<16-28,MR HARRIS>So anyway, it's possible that Sara was up here.

710
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,500
<16-28,MR HARRIS>我只是  不太肯定
<16-28,MR HARRIS>I just... Couldn't really say for sure.

711
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,090
<16-29,MRS HARRIS>或许你们应该问问克洛伊
<16-29,MRS HARRIS>You know, maybe you should  talk to Chloe about this.

712
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:28,800
<16-30,BECKETT>我问过了
<16-30,BECKETT>I already have.

713
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,010
<16-31,MRS HARRIS>她怎么说
<16-31,MRS HARRIS>And what did she tell you?

714
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,000
<16-32,BECKETT>她说那天早些时候见过莎拉
<16-32,BECKETT>She said that she saw Sara earlier in the day,

715
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,650
<16-32,BECKETT>但她没提到
<16-32,BECKETT>But she didn't say anything about

716
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,800
<16-32,BECKETT>莎拉来过你们家
<16-32,BECKETT>Sara being in your apartment.

717
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,500
<16-33,MRS HARRIS>那她还能上来干嘛
<16-33,MRS HARRIS>What else would she be doing up here?

718
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,100
<16-34,MRS HARRIS>什么声音
<16-34,MRS HARRIS>What is that?

719
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,100
<16-35,CASTLE>像是谁的手机响了
<16-35,CASTLE>That sounds like somebody's cell phone.

720
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,900
<16-35,CASTLE>伊恩  这是谁的电话
<16-35,CASTLE>Ian... Who the hell's phone is this?

721
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,050
<16-35,CASTLE>为什么她的电话在你们的卧室
<16-35,CASTLE>Why was her phone in your bedroom?

722
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,900
<17-1,MR HARRIS>可能她落在那了  我真的不知道
<17-1,MR HARRIS>Maybe she dropped it. I don't-- I don't-- I don't know.

723
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,850
<17-2,BECKETT>你说过  你回房间睡觉
<17-2,BECKETT>You told me you went into the bedroom to take a nap.

724
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,450
<17-2,BECKETT>她怎么可能进到房间里  落下电话
<17-2,BECKETT>How could she go into the room, drop the phone,

725
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,440
<17-2,BECKETT>而你却没看见她
<17-2,BECKETT>And you not see her?

726
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,160
<17-3,CASTLE>她说得没错  你想想就知道这解释不通
<17-3,CASTLE>She's right. It doesn't make sense when you think about it.

727
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
<17-4,BECKETT>我们正在对你家药柜里的
<17-4,BECKETT>We're running a test on the condoms

728
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,970
<17-4,BECKETT>避孕套做测试
<17-4,BECKETT>We found in your medicine cabinet.

729
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,500
<17-5,CASTLE>现在有些你不想听的
<17-5,CASTLE>Now there's something you never wanna hear.

730
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,850
<17-6,BECKETT>如果杀精子剂匹配的话  你将被控谋杀
<17-6,BECKETT>If the spermicide's a match, you're facing a murder charge.

731
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,500
<17-7,MR HARRIS>我没杀莎拉
<17-7,MR HARRIS>Well, I- I didn't kill Sara.

732
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,100
<17-8,CASTLE>但是你跟她发生关系了
<17-8,CASTLE>But you were sleeping with her.

733
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,800
<17-9,MR HARRIS>我们是上床了
<17-9,MR HARRIS>Look, we had sex, okay?

734
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
<17-9,MR HARRIS>但莎拉离开我家的时候  她还好好的
<17-9,MR HARRIS>But when Sara left my place, she was fine.

735
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
<17-10,BECKETT>你跟踪她到地下室了  对不对
<17-10,BECKETT>You followed her down to the basement, didn't you?

736
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,300
<17-10,BECKETT>你跟踪她到了地下室
<17-10,BECKETT>You followed her in the basement,

737
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,450
<17-10,BECKETT>然后杀了她
<17-10,BECKETT>And then you killed her.

738
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,600
<17-11,MR HARRIS>不  我不会伤害莎拉
<17-11,MR HARRIS>No! I wouldn't hurt Sara.

739
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,700
<17-12,BECKETT>你不会伤害她
<17-12,BECKETT>You wouldn't hurt her?

740
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,740
<17-12,BECKETT>你这个已婚男人  在家跟她搞婚外情
<17-12,BECKETT>You're a married man sleeping with her in your own bed.

741
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,400
<17-13,CASTLE>她什么时候离开你家的
<17-13,CASTLE>What time did she leave your apartment?

742
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
<17-14,MR HARRIS>快到1点的时候
<17-14,MR HARRIS>A little before 1:00.

743
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,800
<17-15,CASTLE>你凭什么这么肯定
<17-15,CASTLE>How can you be sure?

744
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,700
<17-16,MR HARRIS>因为克洛伊每天一点左右
<17-16,MR HARRIS>Because Chloe gets back from the park with Becca

745
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,100
<17-16,MR HARRIS>带贝佳从公园回来吃午饭
<17-16,MR HARRIS>Every day around 1:00 to give her her lunch.

746
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,900
<17-16,MR HARRIS>莎拉大概在克洛伊回来的十分钟前离开
<17-16,MR HARRIS>And Sara left maybe ten minutes before Chloe got back.

747
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,900
<17-16,MR HARRIS>你们去问克洛伊  她能证明我当时在家
<17-16,MR HARRIS>Look, you ask Chloe, she will tell you I was there.

748
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,100
<17-16,MR HARRIS>我不可能杀莎拉的
<17-16,MR HARRIS>There's no way that I could've killed Sara.

749
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,400
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>贝克特探长  我是弗兰克·加里森
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>Detective Beckett? Frank Garrison.

750
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,500
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>我是哈里斯先生的代表律师
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>I've been retained to represent Mr. Harris,

751
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,900
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>我的当事人
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>And I'm directing him

752
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,300
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>现在不回答你们的任何问题
<17-17,FRANK GARRISON>Not to answer any more of your questions.

753
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,100
<17-18,BECKETT>你的当事人要么在这里回答我的问题
<17-18,BECKETT>Your client can answer my questions here

754
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,000
<17-18,BECKETT>要么当着大陪审团的面回答
<17-18,BECKETT>Or he can answer them  in front of a grand jury.

755
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,200
<17-19,GARRISON>如果你们有足够证据控告他  就去告吧
<17-19,GARRISON>If you've got enough to charge him, do it.

756
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,900
<17-19,GARRISON>否则  他现在就要跟我走了
<17-19,GARRISON>Otherwise, he's coming with me.

757
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,600
<17-19,GARRISON>我们走吧  哈里斯先生
<17-19,GARRISON>Let's go,Mr. Harris.

758
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,240
<17-20,CASTLE>他们了解规则的时候
<17-20,CASTLE>Guess it's a lot tougher

759
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,000
<17-20,CASTLE>就难办多了吧
<17-20,CASTLE>When they actually know the rules, huh?

760
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,700
<17-20,CASTLE>谢谢
<17-20,CASTLE>Thank you.

761
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,100
<18-1,RYAN>化验结果显示  避孕套是一样的
<18-1,RYAN>Lab says condoms are a match.

762
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,750
<18-2,MONTGOMERY>那能证明他们发生了关系
<18-2,MONTGOMERY>So we can prove they had sex?

763
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,400
<18-3,BECKETT>但是  如果克洛伊一点钟到家
<18-3,BECKETT>Look, if Chloe got home at 1:00,

764
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,350
<18-3,BECKETT>他根本来不及
<18-3,BECKETT>Then there's no way he had time

765
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,670
<18-3,BECKETT>到地下室去
<18-3,BECKETT>To get down to the basement,

766
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,000
<18-3,BECKETT>杀掉莎拉再上楼
<18-3,BECKETT>Kill Sara and make it back upstairs.

767
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,300
<18-4,ESPOSITO>也许我们该请克洛伊过来
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Maybe we ought to pick Chloe up

768
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,670
<18-4,ESPOSITO>看看她怎么说
<18-4,ESPOSITO>See if she backs his story.

769
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,200
<18-5,CASTLE>这也不一定
<18-5,CASTLE>We don't have to.

770
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,900
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>为什么
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>Why not?

771
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,400
<18-7,BECKETT>因为电梯的摄像头有时间记录
<18-7,BECKETT>Because the elevator cam had a time stamp.

772
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,950
<18-7,BECKETT>疑犯说
<18-7,BECKETT>Our suspect says that

773
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,300
<18-7,BECKETT>莎拉12点45离开他家
<18-7,BECKETT>Sara left his apartment about 12:45,

774
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,100
<18-7,BECKETT>电梯里的录像显示
<18-7,BECKETT>And the camera in the elevator

775
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,050
<18-7,BECKETT>她12点48分进电梯去地下室
<18-7,BECKETT>Puts her on it headed towards the basement at 12:48.

776
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,900
<18-8,RYAN>我们假设她于十分钟之后被杀
<18-8,RYAN>We think she was murdered maybe ten minutes later.

777
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,150
<18-9,VIDEO TECH>我们现在要找什么
<18-9,VIDEO TECH>So what are we looking for?

778
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,400
<18-10,ESPOSITO>疑犯的保姆
<18-10,ESPOSITO>The nanny who worked for the guy.

779
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,850
<18-10,ESPOSITO>看看他说的是不是真的
<18-10,ESPOSITO>We're just trying to check out his story.

780
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,300
<18-11,MONTGOMERY>他说保姆1点钟到家
<18-11,MONTGOMERY>He claims she got home at 1:00,

781
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,900
<18-11,MONTGOMERY>之后他再也没有出去过
<18-11,MONTGOMERY>And that he never left the apartment again.

782
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,200
<18-12,RYAN>找到了  12点54分
<18-12,RYAN>Ah, there she is. 12:54.

783
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,300
<18-13,CASTLE>那是在莎拉·曼宁
<18-13,CASTLE>Okay, that's six minutes after Sara Manning

784
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
<18-13,CASTLE>进电梯六分钟之后
<18-13,CASTLE>Got on the elevator.

785
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,950
<18-14,MONTGOMERY>这么说来  哈里斯说的是真话
<18-14,MONTGOMERY>Well, I guess Harris was telling the truth.

786
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,600
<18-15,BECKETT>等等
<18-15,BECKETT>Wait.

787
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,300
<18-17,BECKETT>-怎么了  -等等 那个孩子在哪儿?
<18-17,BECKETT>- What?  - Wait, where's the kid?

788
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
<18-18,MONTGOMERY>-哪个孩子  -贝佳
<18-18,MONTGOMERY>- Where's what kid? - Becca.

789
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,000
<18-19,BECKETT>克洛伊照顾的那个小女孩
<18-19,BECKETT>The little girl that Chloe takes care of.

790
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,900
<18-20,MONTGOMERY>也许她把她留在外面
<18-20,MONTGOMERY>Maybe she left the kid in playground

791
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,800
<18-20,MONTGOMERY>给另一个保姆照顾了
<18-20,MONTGOMERY>With one of the other nannies.

792
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,050
<18-21,BECKETT>哈里斯说她每天
<18-21,BECKETT>Harris said that she came back

793
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,300
<18-21,BECKETT>按时把他女儿带回家
<18-21,BECKETT>With his daughter at the same time every day.

794
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
<18-22,RYAN>那又有什么关系
<18-22,RYAN>What difference does it make?

795
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,980
<18-23,CASTLE>世上没有巧合
<18-23,CASTLE>The diffence is that there are no coincidences,

796
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,920
<18-23,CASTLE>至少命案发生的时候没有
<18-23,CASTLE>Not when murder's involved.

797
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,600
<18-24,BECKETT>克洛伊知道莎拉的时间安排
<18-24,BECKETT>Chloe would've known Sara's schedule

798
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,340
<18-24,BECKETT>而且她知道
<18-24,BECKETT>And Chloe would've known that

799
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,800
<18-24,BECKETT>莎拉当时在地下室里
<18-24,BECKETT>That Sara was in the basement at that time.

800
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,600
<18-25,MONTGOMERY>带她回来
<18-25,MONTGOMERY>Pick her up

801
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,550
<19-1,ROOMMATE>有什么事吗
<19-1,ROOMMATE>Can I help you?

802
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,800
<19-2,BECKETT>克洛伊·理查森是不是住在这里
<19-2,BECKETT>Does Chloe Richardson live here?

803
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,500
<19-3,ROOMMATE>是的  但她现在不在
<19-3,ROOMMATE>Yes, but she's not here right now.

804
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,200
<19-4,CASTLE>她去哪儿了
<19-4,CASTLE>Where did she go?

805
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,400
<19-5,ROOMMATE>去城里了
<19-5,ROOMMATE>Into the city.

806
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
<19-6,BECKETT>你介意我四处看看吗
<19-6,BECKETT>Do you mind if I take a look around?

807
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,300
<19-7,ROOMMATE>不介意  但是她不在这里
<19-7,ROOMMATE>No. But...  I'm telling you, she's not here.

808
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,100
<19-7,ROOMMATE>她一小时之前就走了
<19-7,ROOMMATE>She left about an hour ago.

809
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,900
<19-8,CASTLE>探长
<19-8,CASTLE>Detective.

810
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,500
<19-9,ROOMMATE>这是克洛伊的雇主一家人
<19-9,ROOMMATE>That's the family that Chloe works for.

811
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,400
<19-10,CASTLE>并不是完整的一家人
<19-10,CASTLE>Not exactly  the whole family.

812
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,300
<19-10,CASTLE>没有包括孩子的妈妈
<19-10,CASTLE>She cut the mom out of the picture.

813
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,650
<19-11,CASTLE>克洛伊进城去哪儿了
<19-11,CASTLE>Where in the city did Chloe go?

814
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,800
<19-12,ROOMMATE>去他们家了
<19-12,ROOMMATE>To their apartment.

815
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,700
<19-12,ROOMMATE>她说他们今晚要她照顾小孩
<19-12,ROOMMATE>She said that they needed her to babysit tonight.

816
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
<19-13,BECKETT>她一定发现了  我把哈里斯带回去问话
<19-13,BECKETT>She must've found out that I took Harris in for questioning.

817
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
<19-14,CASTLE>如果她问过他老婆  就知道我们放了他
<19-14,CASTLE>If she talked to his wife, she'd know he'd been released.

818
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,420
<19-14,CASTLE>我们都知道
<19-14,CASTLE>And we both know

819
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,480
<19-14,CASTLE>她怎么对待她不喜欢的人
<19-14,CASTLE>What she does to people she doesn't like.

820
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,200
<19-15,BECKETT>她去找伊恩·哈里斯了
<19-15,BECKETT>She's going after Ian Harris.

821
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
<19-15,BECKETT>我们最好在她动手前找到她
<19-15,BECKETT>We better find her before she finds him.

822
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,100
<20-1,ESPOSITO>门卫给楼上打电话
<20-1,ESPOSITO>No answer in the apartment

823
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,300
<20-1,ESPOSITO>但是没人接
<20-1,ESPOSITO>When the doorman called upstairs.

824
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,400
<20-2,RYAN>不过他确定克洛伊在里面
<20-2,RYAN>But he's sure Chloe's there.

825
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
<20-2,RYAN>他说伊恩·哈里斯也在上面
<20-2,RYAN>He says Ian Harris is up there, too.

826
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,300
<20-2,RYAN>他1小时前回来的
<20-2,RYAN>Came home about an hour ago.

827
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,600
<20-3,CASTLE>也就是说克洛伊一直在等他
<20-3,CASTLE>Which means Chloe would've been there waiting for him.

828
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,550
<20-4,BECKETT>行了  没时间
<20-4,BECKETT>All right, we don't have time

829
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,500
<20-4,BECKETT>等紧急救援了
<20-4,BECKETT>To wait for emergency services.

830
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,650
<20-4,BECKETT>我们自己进去
<20-4,BECKETT>We're gonna have to go in on our own.

831
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,800
<20-5,ESPOSITO>他怎么办
<20-5,ESPOSITO>Whoa. What about him?

832
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,300
<20-6,BECKETT>他留在这儿
<20-6,BECKETT>He stays here.

833
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,050
<20-7,CASTLE>不行  拜托  拜托
<20-7,CASTLE>Whoa! No! Come on! Come on!

834
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,800
<20-7,CASTLE>我都签过弃权书了
<20-7,CASTLE>I already signed my life away.

835
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,650
<20-7,CASTLE>还要怎么样
<20-7,CASTLE>What more do you want?

836
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,500
<20-8,BECKETT>那行  卡塞尔  但只是陪同和观察
<20-8,BECKETT>Okay, Castle, but it's accompany and observe,

837
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,300
<20-8,BECKETT>不能参与和干扰  明白吗
<20-8,BECKETT>Not participate and annoy. Got it?

838
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,100
<20-9,CASTLE>虽然没那么好玩了  不过也可以
<20-9,CASTLE>Participate and annoy's a lot more fun, but all right.

839
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
<20-10,BECKETT>你跟在后面  待在走廊
<20-10,BECKETT>And stay behind us in the hallway,

840
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,930
<20-10,BECKETT>我不发话  别乱动
<20-10,BECKETT>And don't move unless I tell you.

841
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:17,100
<20-11,CASTLE>视死如归  你知道我是说
<20-11,CASTLE>Hope to die. You know what I mean. It's...

<21-11,ESPOSITO>Apartment's all clear. Chloe's not here.

<22-17,CHLOE>他一直  都只跟我在一起
<22-17,CHLOE>Only the-- the whole time, He was sleeping with me.

893
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,800
<22-17,CHLOE>他还一直告诉我  他爱的是我
<22-17,CHLOE>And he was telling me that he loved me,

<22-17,CHLOE>他要为了我离开她老婆
<22-17,CHLOE>That he was gonna leave his wife for me.

895
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,500
<22-18,BECKETT>男人有时候就是这样的  克洛伊
<22-18,BECKETT>Guys can be like that sometimes, Chloe.

896
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,800
<22-18,BECKETT>他们会说谎  我知道当你发现真相的时候
<22-18,BECKETT>They can lie, and I know when you find out

897
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
<22-18,BECKETT>会有多么伤心
<22-18,BECKETT>How much it could break your heart.

00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,300
<22-19,CHLOE>我怀孕了
<22-19,CHLOE>I'm pregnant.

<22-21,CHLOE>我只不过想跟她谈谈
<22-21,CHLOE>I just wanted to talk to her.

902
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,900
<22-21,CHLOE>没有别的
<22-21,CHLOE>That's all.

903
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,800
<22-21,CHLOE>我只不过想告诉她  我和伊恩很相爱
<22-21,CHLOE>I just wanted to-- to tell her that Ian and I were in love.

904
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,100
<22-22,BECKETT>我知道莎拉的事不过是个意外  克洛伊
<22-22,BECKETT>I know what happened to Sara was an accident, Chloe.

905

<22-22,BECKETT>我明白
<22-22,BECKETT>I know that.

906
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,200
<22-23,CHLOE>我把贝佳留在公园里  一个人上楼
<22-23,CHLOE>I left Becca in the park, and I went up to the apartment

907
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,300
<22-23,CHLOE>我想知道这是不是真的  因为
<22-23,CHLOE>To see if it was true,'cause, uh...

908
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,700
<22-23,CHLOE>我记得他看着她的样子
<22-23,CHLOE>I'd seen the way he was looking at her.

909
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,000
<22-23,CHLOE>一看到伊恩的床  我就知道了
<22-23,CHLOE>As soon as I saw Ian's bed, I knew.

910
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
<22-23,CHLOE>他去洗澡了  所以我...
<22-23,CHLOE>He went to take a shower, so I--

911
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,500
<22-23,CHLOE>我就下来
<22-23,CHLOE>I came down here,

912
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,300
<22-23,CHLOE>只想跟莎拉谈谈
<22-23,CHLOE>Just to talk to Sara.

913
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,900
<22-24,BECKETT>我知道你不是有意要杀她的  克洛伊
<22-24,BECKETT>I know you didn't mean to kill her, Chloe.

914
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
<22-25,CHLOE>莎拉是我的朋友  你知道吗
<22-25,CHLOE>Sara was my friend, you know?

915
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
<22-25,CHLOE>但是她  她没有
<22-25,CHLOE>But she just-- she didn't...

916
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,100
<22-25,CHLOE>她不懂
<22-25,CHLOE>She didn't get it.

917
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,300
<22-25,CHLOE>她不懂我们之间的感情
<22-25,CHLOE>She didn't get how we felt about each other.

918
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,500
<22-25,CHLOE>所以当她  转身的时候
<22-25,CHLOE>So when-- when she turned around,

919
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,900
<22-25,CHLOE>我抓起那瓶漂白液  砸向她
<22-25,CHLOE>I just... Grabbed the bleach, and I hit her with it.

920
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,700
<22-25,CHLOE>她倒下了
<22-25,CHLOE>And she fell.

921
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,600
<22-25,CHLOE>我太害怕了  我不
<22-25,CHLOE>And I was so scared. I didn't...

922
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,500
<22-25,CHLOE>不知道应该怎么办  所以我就
<22-25,CHLOE>I didn't know what to do, so I just...

923
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,600
<22-25,CHLOE>把她放进干衣机
<22-25,CHLOE>I put her in the dryer.

937
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,310
