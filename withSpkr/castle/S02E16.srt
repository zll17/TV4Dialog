24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,700
<1-1,ALEXIS>六  七  八
<1-1,ALEXIS>Six, seven, eight.

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,260
<1-2,CASTLE>干嘛一大早就跟碧昂斯似的
<1-2,CASTLE>Why you are Beyonce this morning?

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,150
<1-2,CASTLE>你参加了学校的舞蹈社团吗
<1-2,CASTLE>You've got a school dance corner?

27
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,710
<1-3,ALEXIS>不是  阿什莉教了我一些啦啦队的舞步
<1-3,ALEXIS>No. Ashley gave me some of her cheer routine.

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,330
<1-3,ALEXIS>她在校队待了两年
<1-3,ALEXIS>She's been on the J.V. for two years,

29
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,250
<1-3,ALEXIS>她想让我也试试加入
<1-3,ALEXIS>and she wants me to try out for the squad.

30
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,740
<1-4,CASTLE>啦啦队
<1-4,CASTLE>Cheerleading?

31
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,110
<1-5,ALEXIS>是啊  怎么了
<1-5,ALEXIS>Yeah. Why?

32
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,250
<1-6,CASTLE>你是谁  你把我女儿弄哪去了
<1-6,CASTLE>Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,020
<1-7,ALEXIS>啦啦队有什么不好的吗
<1-7,ALEXIS>What's wrong with cheerleading?

34
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,850
<1-8,CASTLE>没  没什么  只是
<1-8,CASTLE>No, no, nothing's-- nothing's...

35
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,280
<1-8,CASTLE>我只是  没想到你会想成为其中一员
<1-8,CASTLE>I'm just--I didn't know you... wanted to be one.

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,190
<1-9,ALEXIS>我也没想到
<1-9,ALEXIS>Me either.

37
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,520
<1-9,ALEXIS>但我看了阿什莉排练  挺有意思的
<1-9,ALEXIS>But I watched Ashley practice, and it looks like fun.

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
<1-9,ALEXIS>而且我的升学辅导员  雪弗女士说
<1-9,ALEXIS>And my college counselor, Ms. Schaefer,

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,450
<1-9,ALEXIS>我需要丰富一下我的课外活动
<1-9,ALEXIS>said I need to consider diversifying my activities.

40
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,700
<1-9,ALEXIS>我觉得我颇具天赋
<1-9,ALEXIS>I figure I'm a natural

41
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,090
<1-9,ALEXIS>因为我整天为你摇旗呐喊
<1-9,ALEXIS>'cause I root for you all the time.

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,180
<1-9,ALEXIS>我得走了
<1-9,ALEXIS>Oh, I gotta go.

43
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,990
<1-10,CASTLE>-爱你  -玩的开心点
<1-10,CASTLE>- Love you. - Have fun.

44
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,040
<1-11,ALEXIS>五六七八
<1-11,ALEXIS>Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

45
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,700
<1-12,CASTLE>啦啦队
<1-12,CASTLE>Cheerleading?

46
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,080
<1-12,CASTLE>怎么了
<1-12,CASTLE>So?

47
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,430
<1-13,MARTHA>-谁...  -还记得你以前想打曲棍球吗
<1-13,MARTHA>- Who... - Ah. The time you wanted to play hockey

48
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,320
<1-13,MARTHA>因为学校里的风云人物都玩那个
<1-13,MARTHA>because all the cool guys in school were playing it?

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,110
<1-14,CASTLE>-没错  但我可没加入球队  -拉倒吧
<1-14,CASTLE>- Yeah, but I didn't join the team. - Well, no,

50
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,480
<1-15,MARTHA>还不是因为你一上场就磕掉两颗牙
<1-15,MARTHA>because you knocked out two teeth at the first practice.

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,820
<1-15,MARTHA>宝贝
<1-15,MARTHA>Darling...

52
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,890
<1-15,MARTHA>让阿丽克西斯自己去领悟这些吧  好吗
<1-15,MARTHA>let Alexis figure this out on her own, hmm?

53
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,910
<1-16,CASTLE>那你上个礼拜干嘛不让我
<1-16,CASTLE>This coming from the woman who just last week told me

54
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,840
<1-16,CASTLE>在太空梭上预约位置
<1-16,CASTLE>not to reserve a seat on the space shuttle?

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,450
<1-17,MARTHA>好吧  这个可以从长计议
<1-17,MARTHA>Oh. Well, we have to rethink that.

56
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,770
<1-17,MARTHA>-真的  -嗯
<1-17,MARTHA>- Really?  - Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,620
<2-1,RYAN>受害人为女性  接近30岁  身份不明
<2-1,RYAN>Vic's a female, late 20s, no I.D.

58
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,470
<2-1,RYAN>天刚亮的时候被一个晨练者
<2-1,RYAN>She was found hanging from the monkey bars

59
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,980
<2-1,RYAN>发现吊在攀架上
<2-1,RYAN>by a jogger just after dawn.

60
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,370
<2-2,CASTLE>那是蜂蜜吗
<2-2,CASTLE>Is that honey?

61
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,590
<2-3,LANIE>从气味上判断  是焦糖酱
<2-3,LANIE>From the smell of it, I'd say it's caramel sauce.

62
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,430
<2-3,LANIE>但还得进一步测试  而不是"尝"试
<2-3,LANIE>But I'll be testing, not tasting.

63
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,830
<2-4,BECKETT>焦糖酱
<2-4,BECKETT>Caramel sauce?

64
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,020
<2-5,CASTLE>也许凶手喜欢甜食
<2-5,CASTLE>Maybe our killer has a sweet tooth.

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,200
<2-6,BECKETT>从她暴露的衣着来看
<2-6,BECKETT>Given her state of undress,

66
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,510
<2-6,BECKETT>我想凶手更像是有某种性癖好
<2-6,BECKETT>I'd say it's more likely he had a sexual fetish.

67
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,860
<2-7,LANIE>没错  我可以接受巧克力
<2-7,LANIE>Yeah, I can do the chocolate,

68
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,170
<2-7,LANIE>甚至是奶油抹在比基尼部位
<2-7,LANIE>I'll even do the whipped cream bikini,

69
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,830
<2-7,LANIE>但是焦糖
<2-7,LANIE>but caramel?

70
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,500
<2-7,LANIE>我喜欢滑溜溜  不要黏糊糊
<2-7,LANIE>I prefer slippery to sticky.

71
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,200
<2-8,CASTLE>她知道我们能听见她的话吗
<2-8,CASTLE>Does she know we can hear her?

72
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,680
<2-9,BECKETT>性趣手铐  还是订做的
<2-9,BECKETT>Bondage cuffs, custom made?

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,790
<2-9,BECKETT>看来凶手喜欢在公共场合玩这个
<2-9,BECKETT>Looks like our killer liked public play.

74
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,690
<2-9,BECKETT>你从哪儿看出
<2-9,BECKETT>How can you tell the difference

75
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,180
<2-10,CASTLE>那是订做的还是一般的
<2-10,CASTLE>between custom and regular?

76
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,590
<2-11,BECKETT>这种皮革大批量生产成本太高
<2-11,BECKETT>The leather is too high quality to be mass-produced,

77
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,570
<2-11,BECKETT>而且这是手工缝制的
<2-11,BECKETT>and it's hand-stitched.

78
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,510
<2-12,CASTLE>不  我是说  "你"是怎么看出来的
<2-12,CASTLE>No, I mean, how can you tell the difference?

79
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,310
<2-13,BECKETT>-死亡时间?  -从尸体温度判断
<2-13,BECKETT>- So time of death?  - From body temperature,

80
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,630
<2-14,LANIE>应该是在昨晚10点到11点之间
<2-14,LANIE>I'd say between 10:00 and 11:00 last night.

81
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,760
<2-14,LANIE>但我确定她不是在这里遇害的
<2-14,LANIE>But I'm pretty sure she was not killed here.

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,210
<2-14,LANIE>从尸体青紫程度来看
<2-14,LANIE>Based on lividity,

83
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,310
<2-14,LANIE>尸体在遇害地点停留了数小时
<2-14,LANIE>she spent several hours in the fetal position after she died,

84
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,480
<2-14,LANIE>然后几小时前才被吊在这里
<2-14,LANIE>and then was hung here a few hours ago.

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,440
<2-14,LANIE>淤血说明她是窒息而死
<2-14,LANIE>Petechial hemorrhaging suggests she was suffocated.

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,750
<2-14,LANIE>另外还有这些
<2-14,LANIE>And then there's these.

87
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,300
<2-15,CASTLE>-她被绑过吗  -看上去是的
<2-15,CASTLE>- Was she restrained?  - Looks like it.

88
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,340
<2-16,LANIE>贝克特
<2-16,LANIE>Yo, Beckett.

89
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,820
<2-17,ESPOSITO>犯罪现场没有留下任何挣扎痕迹
<2-17,ESPOSITO>Crime scene's negative for any signs of a struggle.

90
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,020
<2-17,ESPOSITO>发现了一些不完整的鞋印
<2-17,ESPOSITO>Found about a dozen partial shoe impressions,

91
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,160
<2-17,ESPOSITO>但地面太硬没办法取样
<2-17,ESPOSITO>but the ground's too cold to get any imprints.

92
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,450
<2-18,RYAN>但是  我们发现了这个
<2-18,RYAN>But... we did find this.

93
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,210
<2-18,RYAN>轮子痕迹  间距大约18英寸
<2-18,RYAN>Wheel marks, about 18 inches apart.

94
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,940
<2-19,CASTLE>可拖式行李箱吗
<2-19,CASTLE>Rolling suitcase?

95
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,910
<2-20,BECKETT>从痕迹的深度来看
<2-20,BECKETT>And judging by the depth of the tracks,

96
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,540
<2-20,BECKETT>箱子里装的东西很重
<2-20,BECKETT>I'd say it was carrying something heavy.

97
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,820
<2-21,RYAN>我估计  大约105磅
<2-21,RYAN>I'm guessing around, uh, 105 pounds.

98
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,970
<2-22,BECKETT>那么  他在别的地方杀了她然后移尸此处
<2-22,BECKETT>So he killed her elsewhere and then brought her here.

99
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,390
<2-23,ESPOSITO>这意味着凶杀现场可能是任何地方
<2-23,ESPOSITO>Yeah, which means the crime scene could be anywhere.

100
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,600
<2-24,CASTLE>这从心理学上说不通啊
<2-24,CASTLE>The psychology doesn't make any sense.

101
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,830
<2-24,CASTLE>犯罪现场被精心布置过了
<2-24,CASTLE>The crime scene was pretty elaborately staged,

102
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,140
<2-24,CASTLE>这说明
<2-24,CASTLE>which seems to suggest

103
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,590
<2-24,CASTLE>凶手是早有预谋的
<2-24,CASTLE>a significant amount of premeditation.

104
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,930
<2-24,CASTLE>但从窒息杀人这种方法本身来说
<2-24,CASTLE>But the murder itself-- suffocation--

105
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,570
<2-24,CASTLE>通常意味着冲动型凶杀
<2-24,CASTLE>might indicate a crime of passion.

106
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,060
<2-25,RYAN>那家伙在她身上抹了焦糖
<2-25,RYAN>Guy covered her in caramel.

107
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,430
<2-25,RYAN>你真觉得这凶手还有逻辑可言吗
<2-25,RYAN>Do you really think we're gonna find a logical explanation?

108
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,740
<2-27,CASTLE>纽约提供订做服务的
<2-27,CASTLE>Only a handful of bondage shops

109
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,200
<2-26,BECKETT>性趣用品商店屈指可数
<2-26,BECKETT>in the city do custom work.

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,930
<2-26,BECKETT>把这些手铐的照片散出去
<2-26,BECKETT>So let's take photos of those cuffs, send it out,

111
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,410
<2-26,BECKETT>看有没有人能认出是哪里做的
<2-26,BECKETT>see if anyone can I.D. where it came from.

112
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,860
<2-27,CASTLE>屈指可数
<2-27,CASTLE>"Only a handful of shops"?

113
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,280
<2-27,CASTLE>你到底还有多少事我不知道的
<2-27,CASTLE>Okay, what aren't you telling me?

114
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,030
<2-28,BECKETT>太多了  卡塞尔  一言难尽呐
<2-28,BECKETT>So much, Castle. So very, very much.

115
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,210
<3-1,RYAN>看这种东西时你在我脖子旁喘气
<3-1,RYAN>It's a little creepy doing this

116
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,350
<3-1,RYAN>让我直起鸡皮疙瘩
<3-1,RYAN>with you breathing on my neck.

117
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,190
<3-2,ESPOSITO>不好意思  我也想自己看自己的
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Oh, sorry, bro. I mean, I'd do it on mine,

118
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,810
<3-2,ESPOSITO>但是情报部门会查浏览记录  所以
<3-2,ESPOSITO>but I.A. checks browser history, so...

119
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,060
<3-3,RYAN>很好  多谢了
<3-3,RYAN>Great. Thanks.

120
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,640
<3-4,ESPOSITO>那玩意是干嘛的
<3-4,ESPOSITO>What does that thing do?

121
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,180
<3-5,RYAN>看起来像是土豆削皮器
<3-5,RYAN>Looks like a potato peeler.

122
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,570
<3-6,ESPOSITO>哦  这也太恶心了
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Oh, that is nasty.

123
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,410
<3-7,CASTLE>而且在12个州都是违法的
<3-7,CASTLE>And illegal in 12 states.

124
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,520
<3-8,BECKETT>你说的没错  的确很奇怪
<3-8,BECKETT>Yeah, you're right. That is weird.

125
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,400
<3-8,BECKETT>-好的  谢谢  -什么很奇怪
<3-8,BECKETT>- Okay. Thank you.  - What's weird?

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,190
<3-10,BECKETT>蕾妮做了检验
<3-10,BECKETT>Lanie ran a sart kit.

127
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,200
<3-10,BECKETT>没有任何性侵犯或者性行为的迹象
<3-10,BECKETT>There's no signs of sexual assault or activity.

128
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,360
<3-10,BECKETT>这案子具备了一切性犯罪的特征
<3-10,BECKETT>This has all the makings of a sex crime,

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,950
<3-10,BECKETT>但却与性无关
<3-10,BECKETT>but there's no sex involved.

130
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,120
<3-11,CASTLE>也许这变态是个禁欲主义者呢
<3-11,CASTLE>Well, maybe our psychopath believes in abstinence.

131
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,580
<3-12,BECKETT>我看更可能是性无能吧
<3-12,BECKETT>It's more likely he has a performance problem.

132
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,650
<3-12,BECKETT>而且死者身份不明
<3-12,BECKETT>And there's no I.D.,

133
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,040
<3-12,BECKETT>她的指纹也不在系统数据库里
<3-12,BECKETT>her fingerprints aren't in the system.

134
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,740
<3-14,RYAN>这种姿势怎么摆出来的
<3-14,RYAN>How do you even get in that position?

135
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,500
<3-15,ESPOSITO>我也不知道  但你可以和
<3-15,ESPOSITO>I don't know, but you should try that with your,

136
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,110
<3-15,ESPOSITO>你的宝贝女朋友试下  说实在的
<3-15,ESPOSITO>uh, girlfriend, honey milk. As a matter of fact,

00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,590
<6-12,RYAN>这说明她是
<6-12,RYAN>Which means she was

251
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,490
<6-13,BECKETT>在别的地方遇害的
<6-13,BECKETT>somewhere else when she was killed.

252
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,970
<6-13,BECKETT>好了  跟踪她的手机号码
<6-13,BECKETT>Okay, let's put a trace on her cell phone.

253
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,330
<6-13,BECKETT>如果她有卫星定位装置就好办了
<6-13,BECKETT>If she has a GPS locator, we might get lucky.

254
00:09:59,330 --> 00:09:59,680
<6-14,RYAN>知道了
<6-14,RYAN>All right.

255
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,580
<6-15,BECKETT>杰西卡有没有提过昨晚她要去哪儿
<6-15,BECKETT>Did Jessica ever mention where she was going to be last night?

256
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,100
<6-16,DANIELLE>没有  我10点左右回来的
<6-16,DANIELLE>No. I-I got in at around 10:00.

257
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,020
<6-16,DANIELLE>看上去她没有回来过
<6-16,DANIELLE>It didn't look like she had been home.

258
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,530
<6-16,DANIELLE>因为泰勒在医院值班
<6-16,DANIELLE>Since Tyler was on call, I...

259
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,260
<6-16,DANIELLE>我就以为她是在学校通宵
<6-16,DANIELLE>I assumed she was up at the university

260
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,750
<6-16,DANIELLE>写论文
<6-16,DANIELLE>working on her thesis.

261
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,230
<7-1,PROFESSOR STEVENSON>我也希望能帮到你  探长
<7-1,PROFESSOR STEVENSON>I wish I could help you, detective.

262
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,590
<7-1,PROFESSOR STEVENSON>她有时确实忙到很晚
<7-1,PROFESSOR STEVENSON>Sometimes she'd work late,

263
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,570
<7-1,PROFESSOR STEVENSON>但她昨晚不在这里
<7-1,PROFESSOR STEVENSON>but she wasn't here last night.

264
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,290
<7-2,BECKETT>你确定吗
<7-2,BECKETT>Are you sure about that?

265
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,970
<7-3,STEVENSON>我昨晚改试卷一直到11点才走
<7-3,STEVENSON>I was here till 11:00 grading papers.

266
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,050
<7-3,STEVENSON>要是她在我一定会看见的
<7-3,STEVENSON>I would've seen her.

267
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,780
<7-4,BECKETT>作为她的导师  你对她
<7-4,BECKETT>As her advisor, how much would you know

268
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,540
<7-4,BECKETT>调查的那些人有多少了解呢
<7-4,BECKETT>about the people that she was researching?

269
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,080
<7-5,STEVENSON>她有很长一段时间都和一个名叫
<7-5,STEVENSON>She was spending a lot of time with a dominatrix

270
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,160
<7-5,STEVENSON>"毒液女王"的施虐女郎在一起
<7-5,STEVENSON>named Mistress Venom.

271
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,070
<7-6,CASTLE>"毒液女王"
<7-6,CASTLE>Mistress Venom?

272
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,630
<7-7,STEVENSON>听起来像是《阁楼》[男性杂志]讨论版
<7-7,STEVENSON>Sounds more like

273
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,620
<7-7,STEVENSON>而不是什么博士课程
<7-7,STEVENSON>"Penthouse Forum" than PhD.

274
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,010
<7-7,STEVENSON>卡塞尔先生  研究性相关领域的人
<7-7,STEVENSON>Mr. Castle, people who study sex-related fields

275
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,160
<7-7,STEVENSON>总是被学术界嘲笑
<7-7,STEVENSON>are often derided within academia.

276
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,850
<7-7,STEVENSON>杰西卡只是不想被他们的狭隘之见
<7-7,STEVENSON>Jessica was determined not to be held hostage

277
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,570
<7-7,STEVENSON>所阻挠而已
<7-7,STEVENSON>by their little minds.

278
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,820
<7-7,STEVENSON>"毒液"是杰西卡那方面的引荐人
<7-7,STEVENSON>Venom was Jessica's guide to that world.

279
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,670
<7-7,STEVENSON>如果你想了解更多关于
<7-7,STEVENSON>If you want to know more about

280
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,870
<7-7,STEVENSON>杰西卡所研究的人
<7-7,STEVENSON>the people Jessica was studying,

281
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,430
<7-7,STEVENSON>你得去问问"毒液"
<7-7,STEVENSON>You'll have to ask Venom.

282
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,070
<7-7,STEVENSON>凯莉  这是贝克特探长
<7-7,STEVENSON>Kelly, this is detective Beckett

283
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,590
<7-7,STEVENSON>还有理查德·卡塞尔
<7-7,STEVENSON>and Richard Castle.

284
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,450
<7-7,STEVENSON>他们要查看下杰西卡的研究资料
<7-7,STEVENSON>They need to see Jessica's research.

285
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,860
<7-8,CASTLE>她一直锁着笔记吗
<7-8,CASTLE>She kept her notes locked up?

286
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,050
<7-9,KELLY>她是凯勒曼奖学金的最终竞争者之一
<7-9,KELLY>She was a finalist for the Kellerman fellowship.

287
00:10:59,050 --> 00:10:59,730
<7-9,KELLY>很显然
<7-9,KELLY>You know,

288
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,730
<7-9,KELLY>与同院系的人竞争
<7-9,KELLY>when you're competing against other people in the department,

289
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,790
<7-9,KELLY>笔记随处乱摆
<7-9,KELLY>the last thing you want to do is

290
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,090
<7-9,KELLY>可不是什么好主意
<7-9,KELLY>leave your notes lying around.

291
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,980
<7-10,BECKETT>看起来你们经常熬夜
<7-10,BECKETT>Well, it looks like a lot of late nights.

292
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,830
<7-11,KELLY>当泰勒要值班时
<7-11,KELLY>When Tyler was on shift,

293
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,180
<7-11,KELLY>她就会开通宵  然后乘他
<7-11,KELLY>she'd just pull an all-nighter and go visit

294
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,330
<7-11,KELLY>休息的时候去看他
<7-11,KELLY>him on his breaks.

295
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,060
<7-12,MATT>凯莉  你知道他们找到她时什么情况不
<7-12,MATT>Kelly, did you hear how they found her?

296
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,540
<7-13,KELLY>马特
<7-13,KELLY>Matt--

297
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,800
<7-14,MATT>只穿着内衣被吊在游戏区的攀爬架上
<7-14,MATT>Tied to the monkey bars on a playground in her underwear?

298
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,270
<7-15,KELLY>马特  这是贝克特探长
<7-15,KELLY>Matt, um, this is detective Beckett.

299
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,580
<7-15,KELLY>她是来调查杰西卡的案件的
<7-15,KELLY>She's here investigating Jessica's death.

300
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,610
<7-15,KELLY>马特  杰西和我
<7-15,KELLY>Matt, Jess and I

301
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,380
<7-15,KELLY>是同时开始攻读博士课程的
<7-15,KELLY>all started the PhD program at the same time.

302
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,290
<7-16,BECKETT>可以看出你们关系"不错"
<7-16,BECKETT>I can tell you were close.

303
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,430
<7-17,MATT>-抱歉  我只是  -凯莉
<7-17,MATT>- I'm sorry. It's just... - Kelly,

304
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,340
<7-18,BECKETT>杰西卡在院系里有没有什么仇人
<7-18,BECKETT>did Jessica have any enemies in the department?

305
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,660
<7-18,BECKETT>或是不能和睦相处的人
<7-18,BECKETT>Anyone in school that she didn't get along with?

306
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,500
<7-19,MATT>就算我们为同一奖学金竞争
<7-19,MATT>Just because we were competing for the same fellowship

307
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
<7-19,MATT>也不能说明我们相处不好吧
<7-19,MATT>doesn't mean that we weren't civil.

308
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,960
<7-20,KELLY>不是每个人都那么友好的  过去几周内
<7-20,KELLY>Not everyone was civil. In the last few weeks,

309
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,860
<7-20,KELLY>杰西卡在她办公室里
<7-20,KELLY>Jessica was getting these phone calls

310
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,810
<7-20,KELLY>接到好几个电话
<7-20,KELLY>on her office line.

311
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,980
<7-21,BECKETT>什么样的电话
<7-21,BECKETT>What kind of calls?

312
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,130
<7-22,KELLY>喘气  呻吟
<7-22,KELLY>Um, heavy breathing, moaning.

313
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,290
<7-22,KELLY>听完恨不得用消毒液洗澡
<7-22,KELLY>Made you want to take a hand sanitizer shower.

314
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,210
<7-23,CASTLE>研究生玩这套似乎略显不成熟
<7-23,CASTLE>Seems a little immature for grad students.

315
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,130
<7-24,MATT>听着  我研究的是
<7-24,MATT>Look, I'm studying the impact

316
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,840
<7-24,MATT>接收艾滋病患对市区门诊的影响
<7-24,MATT>of AIDS treatments in inner-city clinics.

317
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,220
<7-24,MATT>凯莉研究如何克服晋升歧视等无形障碍问题
<7-24,MATT>Kelly's is about overcoming the glass ceiling.

318
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,240
<7-24,MATT>而杰西卡却在观察一个性虐女郎
<7-24,MATT>And Jessica was watching a dominatrix

319
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,210
<7-24,MATT>把细高的鞋跟踩入一个窝囊废的胸膛
<7-24,MATT>dig her stiletto into some loser's chest.

320
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,920
<7-24,MATT>她接到那种电话一点也不奇怪
<7-24,MATT>She was bound to get some grief for it. Ah.

321
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,380
<8-1,CASTLE>关于"毒液"施虐过程的笔记太详细了
<8-1,CASTLE>Jessica's notes on Venom's sessions are pretty detailed.

322
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,130
<8-1,CASTLE>简直就像把他们当实验鼠一样研究
<8-1,CASTLE>She studied these guys like lab rats.

323
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,950
<8-2,BECKETT>但她只用绰号来标记他们  比如人妖
<8-2,BECKETT>But she only identifies them by nickname--"Ladyboy,"

324
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,000
<8-2,BECKETT>别针坐垫男  还有惊慌兔
<8-2,BECKETT>"Pin cushion" and "Scared bunny."

325
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,400
<8-3,CASTLE>如果他们不知道杰西卡是在做研究
<8-3,CASTLE>You know, if they didn't know what Jessica was doing,

326
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,160
<8-3,CASTLE>然而其中有人发现了
<8-3,CASTLE>and one of them found out...

327
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,690
<8-4,BECKETT>害怕被暴露是很强的杀人动机
<8-4,BECKETT>Fear of exposure would be a strong motive to kill.

328
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,550
<8-5,CASTLE>真搞不懂她为什么迷上这个
<8-5,CASTLE>I wonder what attracted her to all this.

329
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,230
<8-6,BECKETT>根据她论文的开题报告
<8-6,BECKETT>Well, according to her thesis proposal,

330
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,330
<8-6,BECKETT>她是在亲眼目睹一段不正常性关系后
<8-6,BECKETT>she became interested in s&m after witnessing

331
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,540
<8-6,BECKETT>才对性虐产生兴趣的
<8-6,BECKETT>a dysfunctional relationship up close.

332
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,490
<8-6,BECKETT>很明显  她的论文
<8-6,BECKETT>Apparently her dissertation

333
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,900
<8-6,BECKETT>对比了"地牢"里公然的控制欲
<8-6,BECKETT>compares the overt expressions of dominance in the dungeon

334
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,890
<8-6,BECKETT>和现实世界隐晦的控制欲
<8-6,BECKETT>to more subtle expressions in real-world relationships...

335
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,140
<8-6,BECKETT>比如说对方向盘的控制
<8-6,BECKETT>Like who drives.

336
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,960
<8-7,CASTLE>你肯让我开车我自然会开
<8-7,CASTLE>Hey, I would drive if you would let me.

337
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,820
<8-7,CASTLE>想的挺好  说出来怎么变味儿了
<8-7,CASTLE>That actually didn't prove my point like I thought it would.

338
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,340
<8-8,BECKETT>里面说了"毒液女王"
<8-8,BECKETT>You know, it says here that Mistress Venom

339
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,130
<8-8,BECKETT>在"地牢巷"的某个性虐俱乐部工作
<8-8,BECKETT>works in a bondage club somewhere in dungeon alley,

340
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,680
<8-8,BECKETT>但没指明是哪个
<8-8,BECKETT>but it doesn't say which one.

341
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,670
<8-9,CASTLE>"地牢巷"
<8-9,CASTLE>Dungeon alley.

342
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,860
<8-10,BECKETT>在切尔西区和市中心区之间
<8-10,BECKETT>It's an area between chelsea and midtown.

343
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,350
<8-10,BECKETT>那里都是些特殊性癖好俱乐部
<8-10,BECKETT>There's a whole slew of fetish clubs there.

344
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,600
<8-11,CASTLE>我当然知道"地牢巷"在哪儿
<8-11,CASTLE>Yes, I know where dungeon alley is.

345
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
<8-11,CASTLE>我很奇怪你怎么会知道呢
<8-11,CASTLE>I want to know... how do you know?

346
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,110
<8-12,BECKETT>突击检查了一些俱乐部
<8-12,BECKETT>Vice raided a few of them

347
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,890
<8-12,BECKETT>想找些证据关闭他们
<8-12,BECKETT>looking for a reason to shut them down.

348
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,750
<8-12,BECKETT>但因为没有性交易
<8-12,BECKETT>But since there's no sexual contact

349
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,470
<8-12,BECKETT>而且那些行为都你情我愿
<8-12,BECKETT>and the acts are all consensual,

350
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,730
<8-12,BECKETT>所以他们完全合法
<8-12,BECKETT>it was all perfectly legal.

351
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,160
<8-13,CASTLE>知道吗  你应该去兼职
<8-13,CASTLE>Hmm. You know, you should moonlight.

352
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,710
<8-13,CASTLE>说实话  你会发大财的
<8-13,CASTLE>Seriously, you would make a fortune.

353
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,670
<8-13,CASTLE>得了吧  难道你没想过
<8-13,CASTLE>Come on. Haven't you ever wanted to do...

354
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,790
<8-13,CASTLE>用你的手铐做些其他事
<8-13,CASTLE>something with your handcuffs

355
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,030
<8-13,CASTLE>而不是逮捕罪犯
<8-13,CASTLE>other than arrest criminals?

356
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,180
<8-13,CASTLE>没想过
<8-13,CASTLE>No.

357
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,130
<8-14,BECKETT>但的确有件激情的
<8-14,BECKETT>But there is one hot...

358
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,210
<8-14,BECKETT>狂野的
<8-14,BECKETT>wild...

359
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,180
<8-14,BECKETT>出格的事情我喜欢做
<8-14,BECKETT>kinky thing that I do like doing.

360
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,210
<8-14,BECKETT>就是将凶手绳之以法
<8-14,BECKETT>Putting killers behind bars.

361
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,740
<8-15,CASTLE>瞧见没  你已经懂得戏弄人了  已经上道了
<8-15,CASTLE>See? You're already a tease. You're halfway there.

362
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,280
<8-16,RYAN>我们试着追踪那些
<8-16,RYAN>Hey, we tried to trace the creepy calls

<8-16,RYAN>that Jessica was getting at her office.

364
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,670

366
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,510
<8-16,RYAN>所以无法查到来源
<8-16,RYAN>there's no way to determine their source.

367
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,610
<8-17,BECKETT>手机情况怎样
<8-17,BECKETT>What about the cell phone?

395
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,640

<8-34,BECKETT>This is the perfect way to get Venom

396
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,680
<8-34,BECKETT>最佳方法
<8-34,BECKETT>without tipping our hand.

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,990
<9-2,BECKETT>那你以为应该是什么样的
<9-2,BECKETT>What'd you think it was gonna be?

<9-13,BECKETT>你是"毒液女王"吗
<9-13,BECKETT>Mistress Venom?

419
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,960
<9-14,LADY IRENA>"毒液女王"不能来
<9-14,LADY IRENA>Mistress Venom is unavailable.

420
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,450
<9-14,LADY IRENA>我是伊琳娜夫人
<9-14,LADY IRENA>But I'm Lady Irena.

421
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,700
<9-14,LADY IRENA>这家"地牢"是我开的
<9-14,LADY IRENA>I own this dungeon.

422
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,350
<9-14,LADY IRENA>我们能提供另外合适的"女王"
<9-14,LADY IRENA>I'm sure we can find another dominatrix

423
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,000
<9-14,LADY IRENA>来满足你们的需求
<9-14,LADY IRENA>to suit your needs.

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,270
<9-15,BECKETT>我想不行  我是贝克特探长
<9-15,BECKETT>I'm afraid we can't. I'm detective Beckett.

425
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,710
<9-15,BECKETT>我们正在调查一起谋杀案
<9-15,BECKETT>I need to speak with her right now

426
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,370
<9-15,BECKETT>我要立刻和她谈谈
<9-15,BECKETT>concerning a murder investigation.

427
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,150
<9-16,LADY IRENA>谁被杀了
<9-16,LADY IRENA>Who was murdered?

428
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,540
<9-17,BECKETT>杰西卡·马戈利斯
<9-17,BECKETT>Jessica Margolis.

429
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,460
<9-17,BECKETT>研究"毒液"施虐的一个博士生
<9-17,BECKETT>The PhD student who was observing her sessions.

430
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,210
<9-18,LADY IRENA>从来没人研究过她施虐
<9-18,LADY IRENA>There was no one observing her sessions.

431
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,360
<9-19,BECKETT>你确定吗
<9-19,BECKETT>Are you sure?

432
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,120
<9-20,LADY IRENA>当然  在我的"地牢"里隐私极为重要
<9-20,LADY IRENA>Positive. Privacy is paramount in my dungeon.

433
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,040
<9-21,BECKETT>你见过这个女孩吗
<9-21,BECKETT>You've never seen this girl?

434
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,330
<9-22,LADY IRENA>当然见过
<9-22,LADY IRENA>Of course I've seen that girl.

435
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,450
<9-22,LADY IRENA>她不是"毒液女王"的研究者
<9-22,LADY IRENA>She wasn't observing Mistress Venom.

436
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,470
<9-22,LADY IRENA>她就是"毒液女王"
<9-22,LADY IRENA>She was Mistress Venom.

437
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,000
<9-23,BECKETT>这就能解释她身上的痕迹了
<9-23,BECKETT>This can explain the marks on her body.

438
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,740
<9-23,BECKETT>杰西卡遇害之前肯定穿了
<9-23,BECKETT>Jessica must have been

439
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,450
<9-23,BECKETT>-这样的靴子  -类似这些酷刑靴
<9-23,BECKETT>- wearing this before she died. - Like cruel shoes,

440
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,410
<9-24,LADY IRENA>脱下后痕迹也可以持续几小时
<9-24,LADY IRENA>these outfits can leave marks for hours after you wear them.

441
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,290
<9-24,LADY IRENA>她昨天有三场施虐任务
<9-24,LADY IRENA>She had three sessions yesterday.

442
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,670
<9-24,LADY IRENA>7点半左右离开的
<9-24,LADY IRENA>She left around 7:30.

443
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,910
<9-25,CASTLE>你对杰西卡在你"地牢"里
<9-25,CASTLE>You really had no idea that Jessica was conducting

444
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,120
<9-25,CASTLE>-做社会调查一点也不知情吗  -不知道
<9-25,CASTLE>- a sociological experiment out of your dungeon? - No.

445
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,430
<9-26,LADY IRENA>大约六个月前  她来找我
<9-26,LADY IRENA>She came to me about six months ago.

446
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,700
<9-26,LADY IRENA>很快她就成为我这最火的施刑人之一
<9-26,LADY IRENA>Quickly became one of my most requested doms.

447
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,070
<9-27,BECKETT>她的客户中
<9-27,BECKETT>Did Jessica have any clients

448
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,800
<9-27,BECKETT>有没有对她神魂颠倒的
<9-27,BECKETT>who were unusually obsessed with her?

449
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,350
<9-28,LADY IRENA>当然 他们都入迷了
<9-28,LADY IRENA>Of course. I mean, they all were.

450
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,750
<9-28,LADY IRENA>她的客户都惟她是从
<9-28,LADY IRENA>But her clients were submissive.

451
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,850
<9-28,LADY IRENA>谋杀可是占支配地位的举动
<9-28,LADY IRENA>Killing is an act of dominance.

452
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,500
<9-29,BECKETT>你我都知道人不是那么简单的
<9-29,BECKETT>You and I both know that people aren't that simple.

453
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,470
<9-29,BECKETT>男人可能因为想被羞辱或拷问而来这里
<9-29,BECKETT>Men might come here for humiliation and torture,

454
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,460
<9-29,BECKETT>但有人因受虐过度而发飙
<9-29,BECKETT>but it's easy to imagine that one of them

455
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,750
<9-29,BECKETT>也是可能的
<9-29,BECKETT>might have been pushed too far and lashed out.

456
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,160
<9-30,LADY IRENA>如果她觉得自己有危险
<9-30,LADY IRENA>If she was concerned for her safety,

457
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,280
<9-30,LADY IRENA>肯定会和我说的
<9-30,LADY IRENA>she would've told me.

458
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,420
<9-31,BECKETT>-你有她的客户名单吗  -探长小姐
<9-31,BECKETT>- Do you have a list of Jessica's clients? -Detective..

459
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,770
<9-32,LADY IRENA>我们这提供的所有服务
<9-32,LADY IRENA>All of the services that we provide here

461
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,920
<9-32,LADY IRENA>而服务的一部分就是
<9-32,LADY IRENA>Now part of that service

462
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,310
<9-32,LADY IRENA>保护客户的隐私
<9-32,LADY IRENA>is protecting the privacy of our client.

463
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,220
<9-32,LADY IRENA>守口如瓶可是客户花钱买的
<9-32,LADY IRENA>I'm not about to betray the trust that

464
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,350
<9-32,LADY IRENA>仅凭你的推测恕我不能开口
<9-32,LADY IRENA>they've paid for because you have a hunch.

465
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,490
<9-33,BECKETT>这不只是案情推测而已
<9-33,BECKETT>Oh, I think it's more than just a hunch.

466
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,910
<9-34,LADY IRENA>是嘛  我很抱歉
<9-34,LADY IRENA>Well, gee, I'm sorry.

467
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,770
<9-34,LADY IRENA>除非你有搜查令
<9-34,LADY IRENA>Unless you have a court order,

468
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,960
<9-34,LADY IRENA>否则我无能为力
<9-34,LADY IRENA>my hands are tied, so to speak.

469
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,650
<9-35,BECKETT>作为一个"女王"  你很通晓法律啊
<9-35,BECKETT>You're pretty well-versed in law for a dominatrix.

470
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,040
<9-36,LADY IRENA>别以貌取人
<9-36,LADY IRENA>Don't let the leather fool you.

471
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,450
<9-36,LADY IRENA>我以前可是律师事务所的合伙人
<9-36,LADY IRENA>I used to be a partner at a law firm.

472
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,400
<9-38,LADY IRENA>当你在会议室和审判庭里
<9-38,LADY IRENA>When you dominate and manipulate men

473
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,670
<9-38,LADY IRENA>控制和羞辱男人时
<9-38,LADY IRENA>in every boardroom and courtroom that you're in,

474
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,200
<9-38,LADY IRENA>一切都是那么天经地义
<9-38,LADY IRENA>this just seemed like the natural progression.

475
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,300
<9-39,LADY IRENA>这叫"血色女王"
<9-39,LADY IRENA>It's called Mistress Red.

476
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,780
<9-40,CASTLE>什么
<9-40,CASTLE>Excuse me?

477
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,170
<9-41,LADY IRENA>我的口红颜色
<9-41,LADY IRENA>My lipstick.

478
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,980
<9-41,LADY IRENA>我发现你一直盯着看
<9-41,LADY IRENA>I noticed you couldn't stop staring.

479
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,130
<9-42,CASTLE>抱歉  那色泽太迷人了
<9-42,CASTLE>Sorry. It was just hypnotic.

480
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,870
<9-43,BECKETT>不是气你  我气她
<9-43,BECKETT>It's not you. It's her.

481
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,670
<9-44,CASTLE>如果你现在很不爽
<9-44,CASTLE>Well, if you're so upset,

482
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,320
<9-44,CASTLE>我们可以找个人陪你玩原始游戏
<9-44,CASTLE>we could find someone for you to go medieval on.

483
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,890
<9-44,CASTLE>他怎么样
<9-44,CASTLE>Like, uh, him perhaps.

484
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,030
<9-45,BECKETT>她想袒护客户
<9-45,BECKETT>She wants to protect her clients?

485
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,210
<9-45,BECKETT>她手下的死活就不管了
<9-45,BECKETT>What about her girls?

486
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,930
<9-46,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>你是警察吗
<9-46,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>Hey. You the cop?

487
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,030
<9-47,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长
<9-47,BECKETT>I'm detective Beckett.

488
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,730
<9-48,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>我是"蓝宝石女王"  那件事是真的吗
<9-48,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>I'm Mistress Sapphire. So it's true?

489
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,580
<9-48,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>她死了
<9-48,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>She's dead?

490
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,210
<9-49,BECKETT>是的  我很抱歉
<9-49,BECKETT>Yes. I'm sorry--

491
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,840
<9-50,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>上周有件不寻常的事情
<9-50,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>This weird thing happened last week

492
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,930
<9-50,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>我觉得应该告诉你
<9-50,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>I think you should know about.

493
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,030
<9-51,CASTLE>跟她的客户有关系吗
<9-51,CASTLE>With one of her clients?

494
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,400
<9-52,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>差不多吧  有个第一次光顾的客人
<9-52,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>Sort of. A first-time client came in

495
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,420
<9-52,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>没几分钟就离开了
<9-52,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>for a session, but he left just after a few minutes.

496
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,440
<9-52,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>然后我发现她躲在更衣室里哭泣
<9-52,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>I found her in the locker room, crying.

497
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,730
<9-53,BECKETT>她告诉你原因没
<9-53,BECKETT>Did she tell you why?

498
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,900
<9-55,BECKETT>-没有  -你记得这个客户的特征吗
<9-55,BECKETT>- No. - This client, do you remember anything about him?

499
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,970
<9-56,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>这是一周前的事了  我也只看到他背面
<9-56,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>It was a week ago, and I only saw him from behind.

500
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,450
<9-56,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>不过他穿着类似医生的衬衫
<9-56,MISTRESS SAPPHIRE>But he was wearing one of those medical shirts.

501
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,620
<9-57,BECKETT>实习医生穿的吗
<9-57,BECKETT>Scrubs?

502
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,480
<9-59,CASTLE>-是的  -我们想到一块了没
<9-59,CASTLE>- Yes. - You thinking what I'm thinking?

503
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,810
<9-60,BECKETT>杰西卡的男友发现了她的秘密身份
<9-60,BECKETT>Jessica's boyfriend discovered her secret identity.

504
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,580
<9-61,CASTLE>求婚戒指没送上  反而痛下杀手
<9-61,CASTLE>And instead of proposing to her, he kills her.

505
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,590
<10-1,TYLER>杰西卡是我今生的挚爱
<10-1,TYLER>Jessica was the love of my life.

506
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,990
<10-1,TYLER>-我为何要伤害她  -因为她伤害了你
<10-1,TYLER>- Why would I want to hurt her? - Because she hurt you.

507
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,910
<10-3,TYLER>你说什么鬼话呢
<10-3,TYLER>What the hell are you talking about?

508
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,130
<10-4,BECKETT>你自己也说过了  你想让她停止
<10-4,BECKETT>You said so yourself. You wanted her to stop.

509
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,050
<10-4,BECKETT>你想让她研究其他的东西
<10-4,BECKETT>You were gonna make her study something else.

510
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,370
<10-4,BECKETT>当你发现她不是在研究那个世界
<10-4,BECKETT>It must have been a real shocker

511
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,300
<10-4,BECKETT>她就是那个世界的一员时  你肯定
<10-4,BECKETT>when you realized she wasn't just studying that world,

512
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,590
<10-4,BECKETT>大吃一惊吧
<10-4,BECKETT>she was living it.

513
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,110
<10-5,TYLER>这是什么鬼东西
<10-5,TYLER>What the hell is this?

514
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,250
<10-5,TYLER>这太离谱了  你要告诉我这是真的吗
<10-5,TYLER>This is crazy. You're telling me this is real?

515
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,040
<10-5,TYLER>你说杰西卡就是其中一员
<10-5,TYLER>You're telling me Jessica was one of them?

516
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,710
<10-6,BECKETT>你上周为什么去"地牢"
<10-6,BECKETT>Why did you go to the dungeon last week?

517
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,590
<10-6,BECKETT>-想当面戳穿她吗  -什么"地牢"
<10-6,BECKETT>- Was it to confront her? - The dungeon?

518
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,010
<10-8,CASTLE>我们有目击者看见你去了那里
<10-8,CASTLE>We have a witness who saw you there.

519
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,440
<10-9,BECKETT>这很好理解
<10-9,BECKETT>It's completely understandable.

520
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,500
<10-9,BECKETT>你爱的女人欺骗了你
<10-9,BECKETT>The woman that you loved lied to you?

521
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,340
<10-9,BECKETT>我可以想象你当时情绪如何失控
<10-9,BECKETT>I could see how you could lose control

522
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,990
<10-9,BECKETT>然后一时气愤痛下杀手
<10-9,BECKETT>and go into a jealous rage.

523
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,460
<10-10,CASTLE>接着处于惊慌之中
<10-10,CASTLE>And then in a panic,

524
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,920
<10-10,CASTLE>你决定以不寻常的方式弃尸
<10-10,CASTLE>decide to stage the body in a manner so unusual,

525
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,810
<10-10,CASTLE>让我们误以为这是性虐倾向的人干的
<10-10,CASTLE>we'd naturally assume it was someone in the bondage world.

526
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,460
<10-11,TYLER>我从没去过什么"地牢"
<10-11,TYLER>I never went to a dungeon.

527
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,410
<10-11,TYLER>我也没痛下杀手  因为我根本不知道
<10-11,TYLER>There was no jealous rage because I didn't know!

528
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,740
<10-11,TYLER>我打算和她结婚的
<10-11,TYLER>I was going to marry her.

529
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,380
<10-11,TYLER>我们三天前才签了一份租约  准备同居
<10-11,TYLER>We just signed a lease to move in together three days ago.

530
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,350
<10-11,TYLER>如果我对她很恼火  为什么我还这么做
<10-11,TYLER>If I was so angry with her, why would I do that?

531
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,820
<11-1,BECKETT>租约的事情是实话
<11-1,BECKETT>He was telling the truth about the lease.

532
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,010
<11-1,BECKETT>他们不仅一起签了租约
<11-1,BECKETT>Not only did he and Jessica sign the lease,

533
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,180
<11-1,BECKETT>而且还公证过
<11-1,BECKETT>but it was also notarized.

534
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,470
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>那并不能说明他不是凶手
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>That doesn't mean he didn't do it.

535
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,170
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>可能是他故意让她签的  以此洗脱嫌疑
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>He could've had her sign to help his alibi.

536
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,060
<11-3,CASTLE>也有可能她害怕他
<11-3,CASTLE>Maybe she was afraid of him.

537
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,730
<11-3,CASTLE>我一直在想  她在调查报告中提到的
<11-3,CASTLE>I've been thinking-- the dysfunctional relationship

538
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,900
<11-3,CASTLE>那段不正常的关系
<11-3,CASTLE>she refers to in her research--

539
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,370
<11-3,CASTLE>在一段文字里  她说到人物甲
<11-3,CASTLE>There's a passage where she describes subject "A"

540
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,440
<11-3,CASTLE>害怕告诉人物乙  她要离开了
<11-3,CASTLE>as being afraid to tell subject "B" that she's leaving

541
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,210
<11-3,CASTLE>因为乙已经疯狂地依赖纠缠她
<11-3,CASTLE>because he's become dangerously codependent.

542
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,730
<11-3,CASTLE>如果她说的正是泰勒呢
<11-3,CASTLE>What if she was describing Tyler?

543
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,100
<11-4,MONTGOMERY>她可能就是因此而做了施虐女郎
<11-4,MONTGOMERY>Maybe that's why she became a dominatrix,

544
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,510
<11-4,MONTGOMERY>从而有勇气来为自己出头
<11-4,MONTGOMERY>to give her the courage to stand up for herself.

545
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,790
<11-5,BECKETT>让警员仔细检查医院的安全监控录像
<11-5,BECKETT>We have uniforms combing through hospital security footage.

546
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,110
<11-5,BECKETT>只要泰勒在那天晚上任何时间离开
<11-5,BECKETT>If Tyler left at any point that night,

547
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,460
<11-5,BECKETT>那上面都应该有记录
<11-5,BECKETT>there should be some trace.

548
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,680
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>同时  还要继续追查
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>In the meantime, let's just keep digging through

549
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,420
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>那些调查报告
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>those notebooks.

550
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,700
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>要想起诉的话
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>We're gonna need more than speculation

551
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,670
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>不能只靠推测
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>if we want to file charges.

552
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:22,970
<11-7,BECKETT>明白
<11-7,BECKETT>Great.

553
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,760
<12-1,ALEXIS>爸爸
<12-1,ALEXIS>Dad!

554
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,640
<12-1,ALEXIS>要解释一下吗
<12-1,ALEXIS>Do we need to talk about this?

555
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,430
<12-2,CASTLE>我在调查一个案件
<12-2,CASTLE>This is research for a case.

556
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,910
<12-3,ALEXIS>还有  我得给你买几双出声儿的鞋
<12-3,ALEXIS>And we need to get you some noisier shoes.

557
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,130
<12-4,CASTLE>说真的  我  你加入啦啦队啦
<12-4,CASTLE>Seriously, I-- Hey, you made the team.

558
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,730
<12-5,ALEXIS>没有  选拔赛还在一个月以后
<12-5,ALEXIS>No. Tryouts aren't for another month,

559
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,300
<12-5,ALEXIS>但阿什莉让我把她的队服带回来试穿
<12-5,ALEXIS>But Ashley let me take her uniform home

560
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,980
<12-6,CASTLE>-看是否合身  -那你觉得如何呢
<12-6,CASTLE>- to see how it fit.  - And what do you think?

561
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,770
<12-7,ALEXIS>我觉得这完全不是我的风格
<12-7,ALEXIS>I think it's totally not me,

562
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,890
<12-7,ALEXIS>所以我很喜欢
<12-7,ALEXIS>which is why I kind of like it.

563
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,760
<12-8,CASTLE>-不是你的风格  所以你喜欢  -没错
<12-8,CASTLE>- It's not you, so you like it? - Yeah.

564
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,460
<12-9,ALEXIS>还记得《斯道姆来临》吗
<12-9,ALEXIS>You know how in "Storm fall,"

565
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,890
<12-9,ALEXIS>你因为厌倦了德里克·斯道姆
<12-9,ALEXIS>you killed off Derrick Storm

566
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,810
<12-9,ALEXIS>而把这个角色写死了
<12-9,ALEXIS>because you were bored with him?

567
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,280
<12-11,ALEXIS>-记得  -有时候我也会对自己厌倦
<12-11,ALEXIS>- Yeah.  - Sometimes I feel that way about me.

568
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,600
<12-11,ALEXIS>我总是躲在避风港里
<12-11,ALEXIS>Like I'm hiding inside my comfort zone.

569
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,760
<12-11,ALEXIS>可能现在是时候冒险一下了
<12-11,ALEXIS>And maybe it's time to venture out a little.

570
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,130
<12-12,CASTLE>冒险一定要包括跳啦啦操吗
<12-12,CASTLE>Well, does that venture have to include pom-poms?

571
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,620
<12-13,ALEXIS>我不想以后回忆高中生活时
<12-13,ALEXIS>I don't want to look back on high school

572
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,990
<12-13,ALEXIS>后悔自己错过了些什么
<12-13,ALEXIS>and feel like I missed out on something.

573
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,530
<12-13,ALEXIS>向我保证你会支持我
<12-13,ALEXIS>So promise you'll be supportive.

574
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,280
<12-14,CASTLE>好吧  我
<12-14,CASTLE>Yeah, I, uh...

575
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,320
<12-14,CASTLE>我保证
<12-14,CASTLE>I promise.

576
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,140
<12-15,ALEXIS>真棒  爸爸
<12-15,ALEXIS>Go, dad!

577
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,130
<13-1,CASTLE>你曾经想过要当个啦啦队员吗
<13-1,CASTLE>You ever want to be a cheerleader?

578
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,860
<13-2,BECKETT>没有  你有吗
<13-2,BECKETT>No. Did you?

579
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,430
<13-3,CASTLE>不是我  是阿丽克西斯
<13-3,CASTLE>Not me. Alexis.

580
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,810
<13-3,CASTLE>-她想进啦啦队  -那又怎样呢
<13-3,CASTLE>- She wants to try out for the team.  - So?

581
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,140
<13-5,CASTLE>怎样  你看到她们穿的什么了吗
<13-5,CASTLE>So? You see what they wear?

582
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,430
<13-5,CASTLE>她想进啦啦队
<13-5,CASTLE>She wants to join a team,

583
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,750
<13-5,CASTLE>还不如参加数学竞赛
<13-5,CASTLE>why not join mathletes?

584
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,070
<13-6,BECKETT>她为什么不能两者都参加呢
<13-6,BECKETT>Why can't she do both?

585
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,390
<13-6,BECKETT>而且  小孩子会用与试衣服相同的方法
<13-6,BECKETT>Besides, kids try on personalities

586
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,680
<13-6,BECKETT>去尝试不同的个人风格
<13-6,BECKETT>the way they try on clothes.

587
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,690
<13-6,BECKETT>这是他们了解自己的方式
<13-6,BECKETT>It's the way that they figure out who they are.

588
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,280
<13-7,CASTLE>你在找什么
<13-7,CASTLE>What are you looking for?

589
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,900
<13-8,BECKETT>根据监控录像
<13-8,BECKETT>According to the security footage,

590
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,130
<13-8,BECKETT>她男朋友在值班期间没有离开过医院
<13-8,BECKETT>the boyfriend never left the hospital during his shift.

591
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,880
<13-9,CASTLE>-凶手不是他  -可能他伪造了录像
<13-9,CASTLE>- It wasn't him.  - Maybe he faked the footage.

592
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,810
<13-10,BECKETT>他只是个实习生  不是杰森·伯恩[参见电影《谍影重重》]
<13-10,BECKETT>He's an intern, not Jason Bourne.

593
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,750
<13-11,CASTLE>那么又回到人物乙的问题上来了
<13-11,CASTLE>Oh. Well, there goes my subject "B" theory.

594
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,800
<13-12,BECKETT>杰西卡7点半离开了"地牢"
<13-12,BECKETT>So Jessica left the dungeon at 7:30,

595
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,450
<13-12,BECKETT>而她在10点和11点之间被杀害
<13-12,BECKETT>and she was killed sometime between 10:00 and 11:00.

596
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,620
<13-12,BECKETT>如果她既没回家又没回学校
<13-12,BECKETT>If she didn't go home or to the university,

597
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,980
<13-12,BECKETT>那她去哪儿了呢
<13-12,BECKETT>then where did she go?

599
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,080
<13-13,ESPOSITO>过来看一下  有发现
<13-13,ESPOSITO>Something in here you gotta see.

600
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,200
<13-14,ESPOSITO>有一个杰西卡的研究对象
<13-14,ESPOSITO>It's one of Jessica's subjects.

601
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,840
<13-14,ESPOSITO>她称之为“我是萨姆”[苏斯博士的作品]
<13-14,ESPOSITO>She calls him "Sam-I-am."

602
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,350
<13-15,CASTLE>因为他痴迷苏斯博士吗[儿童读物作家]
<13-15,CASTLE>Because he has a Dr. Seuss fetish?

603
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,980
<13-16,RYAN>SAM是缩写  全称是"聪明绝顶的受虐狂"
<13-16,RYAN>Because he's a sam-- "A smart-assed masochist."

604
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,060
<13-16,RYAN>根据她的笔记
<13-16,RYAN>According to her notes,

605
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,160
<13-16,RYAN>这个萨姆假意自己想被驯服
<13-16,RYAN>a SAM pretends he wants to be submissive,

606
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,330
<13-16,RYAN>但真正目的却是控制他的女主人
<13-16,RYAN>but what he actually wants to do is dominate his mistress,

607
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,680
<13-16,RYAN>方式是以退为进
<13-16,RYAN>usually with passive-aggression.

608
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,840
<13-17,ESPOSITO>他并不主动提要求
<13-17,ESPOSITO>Instead of asking for what he wants,

609
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,060
<13-17,ESPOSITO>他设计的玩法却是让别人恼火
<13-17,ESPOSITO>he makes a game out of making other people upset,

610
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,750
<13-17,ESPOSITO>由此来惩罚别人
<13-17,ESPOSITO>so they can be punished.

611
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,430
<13-18,BECKETT>是吗  还有这种人
<13-18,BECKETT>Really? There's people like that?

612
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,550
<13-19,RYAN>这种萨姆是具有危险性的
<13-19,RYAN>Only these SAMs can be dangerous.

613
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,260
<13-19,RYAN>有时甚至以威胁手段来激起对方的反击
<13-19,RYAN>Sometimes resorting to threats to provoke their response.

614
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,280
<13-20,BECKETT>听听这个
<13-20,BECKETT>Listen to this.

615
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,510
<13-20,BECKETT>他说"毒液女王"就是那个
<13-20,BECKETT>He said Mistress Venom was the one

616
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,110
<13-20,BECKETT>应受惩罚的人
<13-20,BECKETT>who needed to be punished.

617
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,230
<13-20,BECKETT>他说他要找到她  把她绑起来
<13-20,BECKETT>He said he was going to find her, tie her up

618
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,390
<13-20,BECKETT>然后淹死她
<13-20,BECKETT>and drown her,

619
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,910
<13-20,BECKETT>但是是用某种
<13-20,BECKETT>but in something...

620
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,890
<13-20,BECKETT>蜜浆  如焦糖
<13-20,BECKETT>sweet, like caramel."

621
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,110
<13-21,MONTGOMERY>性癖好  还有对犯罪现场的描写
<13-21,MONTGOMERY>Sexual obsession and a description of the crime scene.

622
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,140
<13-21,MONTGOMERY>听起来像是凶手
<13-21,MONTGOMERY>Sounds like our guy to me.

623
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,560
<13-22,ESPOSITO>确实  但我们只有绰号
<13-22,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but we only got a nickname.

624
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,430
<13-23,MONTGOMERY>我们不只有个绰号  我们完全可以
<13-23,MONTGOMERY>We have more than a nickname. We have enough

625
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,850
<13-23,MONTGOMERY>逼伊琳娜夫人交出她的客户名单
<13-23,MONTGOMERY>to force lady Irena to turn over her client list.

626
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,530
<13-24,BECKETT>请帮我连线马克威法官
<13-24,BECKETT>Judge Markway, please.

627
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,120
<13-25,CASTLE>哦  看来有人要接受惩罚了
<13-25,CASTLE>Ooh. Sounds like someone's gonna get punished.

628
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,760
<13-25,CASTLE>威廉姆·卡若威  即“我是萨姆”
<13-25,CASTLE>William Karaway, a.k.a."Sam-I-am"

629
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,000
<14-1,ESPOSITO>高级副总裁
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Senior vice president at

630
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,300
<14-1,ESPOSITO>任职于"斯图特&卡伯特&萨根"公司
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Stewart, Cabot and Sagansky.

631
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,520
<14-2,CASTLE>-那个全球咨询公司  -没错
<14-2,CASTLE>- The global consulting firm?  - Mm-hmm.

632
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,080
<14-4,CASTLE>难怪伊琳娜夫人要隐瞒他的身份
<14-4,CASTLE>No wonder lady Irena was protecting his identity.

633
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,620
<14-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这次你就不参与审讯了吧
<14-5,BECKETT>Castle, why don't you sit this one out?

634
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,180
<14-5,BECKETT>我想面对一个强势点的女性  卡若威先生
<14-5,BECKETT>I think Mr. Caraway will respond better to a strong...

635
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,530
<14-5,BECKETT>会更加配合一点
<14-5,BECKETT>female hand.

636
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,590
<14-6,CASTLE>我是萨姆  被关在屋子里
<14-6,CASTLE>Sam-I-am... in a box...

637
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,510
<14-6,CASTLE>还有一只母老虎  我们有好戏看了
<14-6,CASTLE>with a fox-- We're gonna need some popcorn.

638
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,850
<15-1,BECKETT>坐下
<15-1,BECKETT>Sit.

639
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,720
<15-2,CARAWAY>你该先告诉我为什么把我关在这儿
<15-2,CARAWAY>First why don't you tell me why the hell I'm here?

640
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,640
<15-3,BECKETT>-我有个董事会  -我叫你坐下  立刻
<15-3,BECKETT>- I got a board meeting... - I said sit down... now.

641
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,540
<15-4,BECKETT>真乖
<15-4,BECKETT>Good boy.

642
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,300
<15-4,BECKETT>你的女主人将为你感到非常骄傲
<15-4,BECKETT>Your mistress would be very proud of you.

643
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,280
<15-4,BECKETT>你说什么
<15-4,BECKETT>Excuse me?

644
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,340
<15-5,CARAWAY>"毒液女王"
<15-5,CARAWAY>Mistress Venom.

645
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,090
<15-6,BECKETT>"伊琳娜夫人的痛苦庄园"
<15-6,BECKETT>Lady Irena's house of pain.

646
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,340
<15-6,BECKETT>你喜欢被绑  喜欢被鞭打
<15-6,BECKETT>You like to be tied up, you like to be spanked.

647
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,580
<15-6,BECKETT>但相比之下  你更喜欢威胁别人
<15-6,BECKETT>But more than anything, you like to make threats.

648
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,150
<15-7,CARAWAY>我不知道你在说什么
<15-7,CARAWAY>I don't know what you're talking about.

649
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,260
<15-8,BECKETT>在纽约  施虐女郎的顾客是没有隐私的
<15-8,BECKETT>There is no dominatrix-client privilege in New York.

650
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,810
<15-8,BECKETT>而你的主人很详尽的记录了
<15-8,BECKETT>And your mistress was very thorough

651
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,930
<15-8,BECKETT>你内心深处最黑暗的欲望
<15-8,BECKETT>in documenting your deepest, darkest desires--

652
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,390
<15-8,BECKETT>那些配套工具  你喜欢怎样玩儿
<15-8,BECKETT>the thing with the matches, how you liked it messy.

653
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,220
<15-9,CARAWAY>她都写下来啦
<15-9,CARAWAY>She wrote that down?

654
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,370
<15-10,BECKETT>她也写了你如何想要反过来虐待她
<15-10,BECKETT>She also wrote how you wanted to turn the tables on her,

655
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,540
<15-10,BECKETT>你威胁要把她绑起来  在焦糖中溺死她
<15-10,BECKETT>how you threatened to tie her up and drown her in caramel.

656
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,920
<15-11,CARAWAY>我  这只是幻想
<15-11,CARAWAY>I-it's fantasy.

657
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,690
<15-12,BECKETT>但你不满足于幻想
<15-12,BECKETT>But the fantasies weren't enough.

658
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,870
<15-12,BECKETT>所以就让它成为了现实
<15-12,BECKETT>And so you had to make your dreams come true.

659
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,070
<15-13,CARAWAY>不  这不可能
<15-13,CARAWAY>No, that's not possible.

660
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,610
<15-14,BECKETT>她越抵抗  你就越痴迷
<15-14,BECKETT>The more she said no, the more you became obsessed.

661
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,250
<15-14,BECKETT>你不想做奴隶
<15-14,BECKETT>You didn't want to be the submissive.

662
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,740
<15-14,BECKETT>你想要主宰她
<15-14,BECKETT>You wanted to dominate her,

663
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,310
<15-14,BECKETT>而最终极的主宰就是谋杀
<15-14,BECKETT>and the ultimate domination is murder.

664
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,080
<15-15,CARAWAY>不  我发誓  我都不知道她死了
<15-15,CARAWAY>No, I swear. I didn't even know she was dead.

665
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,820
<15-16,BECKETT>你威胁她时说的具体内容
<15-16,BECKETT>You were very specific in your threats,

666
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,020
<15-16,BECKETT>和尸体被发现时完全一样
<15-16,BECKETT>and that's exactly how we found her.

667
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,080
<15-16,BECKETT>你还想否认那不是你干的
<15-16,BECKETT>Do you really expect me to believe that that wasn't you?

668
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,570
<15-17,CARAWAY>肯定是有人发现了这个
<15-17,CARAWAY>Well--well, someone must have found out.

669
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,480
<15-17,CARAWAY>可能有人看过她的笔记
<15-17,CARAWAY>Someone could've read her notes.

670
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,190
<15-18,BECKETT>前天晚上你在哪儿
<15-18,BECKETT>Where were you two nights ago?

671
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,610
<15-19,BECKETT>卡若威先生  你在哪里
<15-19,BECKETT>Mr. Caraway, where were you?

672
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,680
<15-20,CARAWAY>我和我妻子在一起
<15-20,CARAWAY>I was with my wife.

673
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,030
<15-20,CARAWAY>那天是我们的结婚周年日
<15-20,CARAWAY>It was our anniversary.

674
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,560
<16-1,ESPOSITO>他妻子证实了
<16-1,ESPOSITO>His wife confirms it.

675
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,610
<16-1,ESPOSITO>他整晚都和她一起在周年晚会上
<16-1,ESPOSITO>He was with her at the anniversary party all night.

676
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,310
<16-2,BECKETT>这个手法简直太独特了
<16-2,BECKETT>This staging was way too specific

677
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,560
<16-2,BECKETT>不可能只是个巧合  肯定有人知道内情
<16-2,BECKETT>to be just a coincidence. Somebody knew.

678
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,130
<16-3,ESPOSITO>可能是她告诉谁了
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Maybe she told someone.

679
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,000
<16-4,CASTLE>或者有人看过她的调查报告
<16-4,CASTLE>Maybe someone had access to the research.

680
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,510
<16-4,CASTLE>文件柜又不是诺克斯堡[美军事基地]
<16-4,CASTLE>Filing cabinet's not Fort Knox.

681
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,790
<16-4,CASTLE>任何可以打开文件柜的人都能看到这些记录
<16-4,CASTLE>Anyone with access would've read exactly what we read

682
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,670
<16-4,CASTLE>然后借刀杀人
<16-4,CASTLE>and could use it to throw us off their trail.

683
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,430
<16-5,BECKETT>好  你和莱恩再去一次"地牢"
<16-5,BECKETT>Okay. You and Ryan go back to the dungeon.

684
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,190
<16-5,BECKETT>看有没有哪个女郎能提供点线索
<16-5,BECKETT>See if any of the girls swap stories after work.

685
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,190
<16-5,BECKETT>同时  卡塞尔和我去学校
<16-5,BECKETT>Meanwhile, Castle and I will go to the university

686
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,120
<16-5,BECKETT>查看下谁动过她的报告
<16-5,BECKETT>and see who had access to her research.

687
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,580
<16-6,ESPOSITO>好
<16-6,ESPOSITO>Okay.

688
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,600
<16-7,MISTRESS>没  "毒液女王"从未对我提到过他
<16-7,MISTRESS>No, Mistress Venom never mentioned him to me,

689
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,610
<16-7,MISTRESS>也没提过其他客户
<16-7,MISTRESS>or any of her other clients.

690
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,750
<16-8,ESPOSITO>是吗  别耍我了
<16-8,ESPOSITO>Really? Come on.

691
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,240
<16-8,ESPOSITO>难道你们从不讨论客户吗
<16-8,ESPOSITO>You girls don't share shop talk?

692
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,030
<16-9,MISTRESS>在这里工作久了之后
<16-9,MISTRESS>You work here long enough,

693
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,740
<16-9,MISTRESS>你能想象的最怪癖的事情
<16-9,MISTRESS>and the kinkiest things you could ever imagine...

694
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,110
<16-9,MISTRESS>就是明天还要再来
<16-9,MISTRESS>are just another day at the office.

695
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,290
<16-9,MISTRESS>客户共享时  我们才交换信息
<16-9,MISTRESS>The only time we trade info is if we share clients.

696
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,890
<16-9,MISTRESS>但"毒液女王"从不和我们分享
<16-9,MISTRESS>But Mistress Venom didn't share.

697
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,710
<16-9,MISTRESS>能帮我把靴子解开吗
<16-9,MISTRESS>Do you mind unstrapping my boot?

698
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,550
<16-10,RYAN>谢谢  "琥珀女王"
<16-10,RYAN>Uh, thank you, Mistress Amber?

699
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,150
<16-11,MISTRESS AMBER>-是的  -以及"蝎子女王"
<16-11,MISTRESS AMBER>- Yes.  - Mistress Scorpion?

700
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,990
<16-12,RYAN>好了  有点混乱  不好意思
<16-12,RYAN>Okay, I get 'em confused. I'm sorry.

701
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,090
<16-13,MISTRESS>快点
<16-13,MISTRESS>Faster.

702
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,620
<16-14,ESPOSITO>她有没有可能会
<16-14,ESPOSITO>Is, uh, is there a possibility

703
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,320
<16-14,ESPOSITO>对一个客户说另一个客户的
<16-14,ESPOSITO>that she may have mentioned one client's fetishes

704
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,510
<16-14,ESPOSITO>-一些癖好  -绝对不可能
<16-14,ESPOSITO>- to another client?  -Absolutely not.

705
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,710
<16-15,MISTRESS>伊琳娜夫人让我们牢记一定要保密
<16-15,MISTRESS>Lady Irena beats confidentiality rules into our heads.

706
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,780
<16-15,MISTRESS>"毒液女王"又不是傻瓜
<16-15,MISTRESS>Mistress Venom wasn't stupid.

707
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,210
<16-15,MISTRESS>有那么难解吗
<16-15,MISTRESS>Is there a problem?

708
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,350
<16-16,ESPOSITO>这个结  像个八角结
<16-16,ESPOSITO>Just this knot. It's like an octagonal knot.

709
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,070
<16-16,ESPOSITO>像有八个角似的  我从没见过这样的结
<16-16,ESPOSITO>It's got, like, eight sides. I've never seen a knot like--

710
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,080
<16-17,RYAN>埃斯波西托警探让罪行低头下跪
<16-17,RYAN>Detective Esposito bringing crime to its knees.

711
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,480
<16-18,MISTRESS>不准走
<16-18,MISTRESS>Stay.

712
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,150
<16-19,RYAN>没有哪个女郎听到杰西卡
<16-19,RYAN>So none of the girls claim that they remember Jessica

713
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,960
<16-19,RYAN>谈论过她的任何一位客户
<16-19,RYAN>talking about any of her clients.

714
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,280
<16-19,RYAN>但对于她离开这里到被杀害的
<16-19,RYAN>But I think we might have an explanation

715
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,220
<16-19,RYAN>那段时间  她去了哪儿
<16-19,RYAN>as to where she was between the time she left work

716
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
<16-19,RYAN>似乎找到了些答案
<16-19,RYAN>and when she was killed.

717
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,210
<16-20,MISTRESS>"蝎子女王"认为
<16-20,MISTRESS>Uh, Mistress Scorpion thinks

718
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,820
<16-20,MISTRESS>杰西卡可能在捞外快
<16-20,MISTRESS>that Jessica might have been working off the books.

719
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,740
<16-20,MISTRESS>如果是这样的话  那她就是自找麻烦
<16-20,MISTRESS>Well, if she was, then she was asking for trouble.

720
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,660
<16-20,MISTRESS>伊琳娜夫人最烦的就是  有些女郎
<16-20,MISTRESS>Nothing upsets lady Irena more than some girl

721
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,870
<16-20,MISTRESS>企图吞掉本该她赚的40%
<16-20,MISTRESS>trying to screw her out of her 40%.

722
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,920
<16-22,MISTRESS>爱尔兰来的  帮一下你这位小兄弟吧
<16-22,MISTRESS>Hey, Irish, you want to help out your little buddy here?

723
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,970
<16-22,MISTRESS>他笨手笨脚的
<16-22,MISTRESS>He seems to be all thumbs.

724
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,010
<17-1,BECKETT>你和她在同一间办公室  凯莉
<17-1,BECKETT>You were her officemate Kelly.

725
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,180
<17-1,BECKETT>你要想拿到她的报告简直轻而易举
<17-1,BECKETT>It would've been very easy for you to access her files.

726
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,910
<17-2,KELLY>不  不可能  我说过了
<17-2,KELLY>No, it wouldn't. I told you.

727
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,710
<17-2,KELLY>她对自己的工作非常保密
<17-2,KELLY>She was very private about her work.

728
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,350
<17-3,CASTLE>你是说她
<17-3,CASTLE>You mean to tell me,

729
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,790
<17-3,CASTLE>从没把笔记留在桌上
<17-3,CASTLE>she didn't once slip out to the bathroom

730
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,990
<17-3,CASTLE>然后去洗手间吗
<17-3,CASTLE>and just leave her notes sitting on the desk?

731
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,810
<17-4,KELLY>就算有  我也没兴趣
<17-4,KELLY>If she did, I wouldn't be interested.

732
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,810
<17-4,KELLY>而且她被杀害的那晚
<17-4,KELLY>And the night she was killed,

733
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,970
<17-4,KELLY>我和家人在威彻斯特
<17-4,KELLY>I was in Westchester with my folks.

734
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,970
<17-5,BECKETT>还有别人有这个办公室的钥匙吗
<17-5,BECKETT>Does anyone else have access to this office?

735
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,320
<17-6,KELLY>还有唯一一个有钥匙的人
<17-6,KELLY>The only other person with a key to the office

736
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,230
<17-7,CASTLE>-就是管理员  -你的钥匙呢
<17-7,CASTLE>- is maintenance. - What about your keys?

737
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,060
<17-7,CASTLE>-有没有掉过或借给某个朋友  -没有
<17-7,CASTLE>- Did you ever lose them or lend them to a friend?  - No.

738
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,510
<17-8,KELLY>上星期我给过马特
<17-8,KELLY>I mean, I gave them to Matt last week

739
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,940
<17-8,KELLY>因为他说他落了些文件在这儿了
<17-8,KELLY>because he said he had some papers here.

740
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,320
<17-8,KELLY>难道你觉得他撬开了她的文件柜
<17-8,KELLY>What, you think he broke in to her filing cabinet

741
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,940
<17-8,KELLY>然后拿了她的研究报告
<17-8,KELLY>and took her research?

742
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,200
<17-8,KELLY>这正是我所想的
<17-8,KELLY>That is exactly what I'm thinking.

743
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,940
<17-9,CASTLE>你自己说过  这是个竞争性很大的研究课题
<17-9,CASTLE>You said it yourself. It's a very competitive program.

744
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,650
<17-9,CASTLE>而且他们是同一奖学金的最终候选人
<17-9,CASTLE>And they were both finalists for the same fellowship.

745
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,800
<17-9,CASTLE>这是马特研究艾滋病
<17-9,CASTLE>This is, uh, Matt's proposal for studying

746
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,790
<17-9,CASTLE>对市区门诊影响的开题报告
<17-9,CASTLE>the effect of A.I.D.S. on inner-city clinics.

747
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,930
<17-10,BECKETT>-看这张照片  -他穿着实习医生服
<17-10,BECKETT>- Look at the picture.  - He's in scrubs.

748
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,830
<17-11,CASTLE>那个在"地牢"
<17-11,CASTLE>It wasn't Tyler who

749
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,820
<17-11,CASTLE>和杰西卡对质的人不是泰勒
<17-11,CASTLE>confronted Jessica at the dungeon.

750
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,390
<17-12,BECKETT>是马特
<17-12,BECKETT>It was matt.

751
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,100
<18-1,MATT>我借了凯莉的钥匙  那并不能证明什么
<18-1,MATT>I borrowed Kelly's keys. That doesn't prove anything.

752
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,890
<18-2,BECKETT>所以我们才仔细审查了整个案件
<18-2,BECKETT>Which is why we took a look at the whole picture.

753
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,160
<18-2,BECKETT>这是从你的手机
<18-2,BECKETT>This is a list of phone calls

754
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,250
<18-2,BECKETT>打到学校总机的电话单
<18-2,BECKETT>made from your cell phone to the university switchboard.

755
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,310
<18-2,BECKETT>每一个都和杰西卡接到的骚扰电话相吻合
<18-2,BECKETT>Each one coincides with a harassing call to Jessica.

756
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,530
<18-3,CASTLE>是你打的那些电话
<18-3,CASTLE>You made those calls.

757
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,710
<18-4,MATT>这只是个玩笑
<18-4,MATT>Look, it was a joke.

758
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,910
<18-5,BECKETT>那你上星期去"地牢"找杰西卡
<18-5,BECKETT>How about your little visit to Jessica

759
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,940
<18-5,BECKETT>又作何解释呢
<18-5,BECKETT>at the dungeon last week?

760
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,210
<18-5,BECKETT>那也是个玩笑吗
<18-5,BECKETT>Was that a joke as well?

761
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,750
<18-6,CASTLE>她没告诉过任何人"地牢"的地点
<18-6,CASTLE>She didn't tell anybody where the dungeon was.

762
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,020
<18-6,CASTLE>你是如何找到的
<18-6,CASTLE>So how'd you find it?

763
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,100
<18-6,CASTLE>你是跟踪她还是根据她报告上的线索找到的
<18-6,CASTLE>Did you follow her or the clues in her research?

764
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,090
<18-7,BECKETT>你是她争取奖学金的竞争对手
<18-7,BECKETT>You were her rival for a fellowship.

765
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,380
<18-7,BECKETT>你需要除掉她
<18-7,BECKETT>You needed her out of the way.

766
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,600
<18-7,BECKETT>而当看到她的报告时  你发现了机会
<18-7,BECKETT>And when you read her research, you saw your chance.

767
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,650
<18-8,MATT>没错  我是需要那笔钱
<18-8,MATT>Look, I needed that funding, okay?

768
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,350
<18-8,MATT>我的研究很重要  本来就是  说实话
<18-8,MATT>My work is important. I mean, come on. Seriously.

769
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,030
<18-8,MATT>我不能让她拿到那笔奖学金
<18-8,MATT>I couldn't let her get that fellowship.

770
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,940
<18-8,MATT>我看了她的报告  写的像小说一样
<18-8,MATT>And when I saw her research, I mean, it read like fiction.

771
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,570
<18-8,MATT>于是我就到"地牢"去查看究竟
<18-8,MATT>So I went to the dungeon to find out.

772
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,420
<18-9,CASTLE>也就是说你撬开了她的文件柜
<18-9,CASTLE>So you broke in to her filing cabinet,

773
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,200
<18-9,CASTLE>复印了她的研究报告
<18-9,CASTLE>you copied her research,

774
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,310
<18-9,CASTLE>接着跟踪她到"地牢"
<18-9,CASTLE>and then you followed her to the dungeon.

775
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,640
<18-9,CASTLE>你可没怎么在清白那栏里
<18-9,CASTLE>You're not putting a whole lot of checks

776
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,140
<18-9,CASTLE>打勾啊  马特
<18-9,CASTLE>in the innocent column here, Matt.

777
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,240
<18-9,CASTLE>清白栏
<18-9,CASTLE>The innocent column.

778
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,180
<18-10,MATT>听着  我是威胁过她
<18-10,MATT>Listen... I threatened her.

779
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,210
<18-10,MATT>我认了  但我没杀她
<18-10,MATT>All right? But I did not kill her.

780
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,270
<18-10,MATT>当我发现她就是"毒液女王"后
<18-10,MATT>When I found out that she was Mistress Venom,

781
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,740
<18-10,MATT>我跟她说  如果她不撤销
<18-10,MATT>I told her that if she didn't withdraw

782
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,310
<18-10,MATT>奖学金申请  我就告诉她男友真相
<18-10,MATT>her fellowship application, I was gonna tell her boyfriend.

783
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,710
<18-11,CASTLE>-结果不奏效  你就杀了她  -奏效了
<18-11,CASTLE>- And when that didn't work, you killed her?  - It did work.

784
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,700
<18-12,MATT>杰西卡在被杀前一天撤销了申请
<18-12,MATT>Jessica withdrew her application the day before she was killed.

785
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,250
<18-13,BECKETT>-你如何知道  -因为她抄送给我了
<18-13,BECKETT>- How do you know? - Because she blind copied me on an e-mail

786
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,250
<18-14,MATT>她发给委员会主席的电邮
<18-14,MATT>that she sent to the head of the committee.

787
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,540
<18-14,MATT>我跟她没冲突了
<18-14,MATT>We were cool.

788
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,390
<18-14,MATT>她最关心的是拿回
<18-14,MATT>What she was most concerned about was getting back

789
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,850
<18-14,MATT>我复印的研究报告
<18-14,MATT>this research that I copied.

790
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,940
<18-14,MATT>她没跟我争奖学金之后
<18-14,MATT>So as soon as she was out of the running,

791
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,940
<18-14,MATT>我就送回到她的公寓了
<18-14,MATT>I brought it all back to her apartment.

792
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,870
<19-1,CASTLE>他知道  如果洗脱嫌疑的证据是勒索
<19-1,CASTLE>You know you are morally challenged,

793
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,860
<19-1,CASTLE>他将受到道德上的谴责
<19-1,CASTLE>if your murder alibi is a blackmailing scheme.

794
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,890
<19-2,BECKETT>是的  如果他说的是实话
<19-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but if he's telling the truth,

795
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,070
<19-2,BECKETT>我们就缺少动机
<19-2,BECKETT>then we have no motive.

796
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,950
<19-3,CASTLE>你们好  绅士们
<19-3,CASTLE>Well, hello, gentleman.

797
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,720
<19-3,CASTLE>"地牢"之行怎样
<19-3,CASTLE>How was your trip to the dungeon?

798
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,630
<19-4,RYAN>原来埃斯波西托对鞋带不怎么在行
<19-4,RYAN>Well, we learned that Esposito is not very good with laces.

799
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,050
<19-5,ESPOSITO>鞋带太多了  我替你解开的
<19-5,ESPOSITO>There were a lot of lace-- I-I loosened 'em for you.

800
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,370
<19-6,RYAN>没错
<19-6,RYAN>Yeah, sure.

801
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,620
<19-6,RYAN>那里的人都说杰西卡
<19-6,RYAN>None of the girls admit to Jessica sharing

802
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,100
<19-6,RYAN>不和她们八卦客人的秘密
<19-6,RYAN>any of her client secrets with 'em.

803
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,090
<19-7,ESPOSITO>有一个认为她也许在"地牢"外见客户
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, one of 'em thought that she might have been seeing clients

804
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,840
<19-7,ESPOSITO>这刚好填补了时间上的缺失部分
<19-7,ESPOSITO>outside of the dungeon, which might explain the hole in our timeline.

805
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,550
<19-8,RYAN>但我们再次调查她的电话和收入
<19-8,RYAN>But we ran through her phones and financials again.

806
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,720
<19-8,RYAN>我们却找不到任何记录
<19-8,RYAN>We can't find any record of it.

807
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,050
<19-8,RYAN>你们进展如何  听说有个嫌疑人
<19-8,RYAN>How about you? Hear you have a suspect.

808
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,940
<19-9,BECKETT>曾有个  马特说的是实话
<19-9,BECKETT>Had. Matt was telling the truth.

809
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,230
<19-9,BECKETT>杰西卡退出了奖学金争夺战
<19-9,BECKETT>Jessica pulled out of the fellowship.

810
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,560
<19-10,CASTLE>但如果他说的是实话  那他送回她公寓的
<19-10,CASTLE>But if he was telling the truth, then where's all the research

811
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,380
<19-10,CASTLE>研究报告又在哪里
<19-10,CASTLE>he brought back to her apartment?

812
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,110
<19-10,CASTLE>出于隐私的考虑
<19-10,CASTLE>Given her concerns for privacy,

813
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,870
<19-10,CASTLE>她不可能扔掉
<19-10,CASTLE>she wouldn't just throw it away.

814
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,130
<19-11,BECKETT>我们知道她并没有带回大学里
<19-11,BECKETT>And we know she didn't take it back to the university.

815
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,430
<19-11,BECKETT>也许我们遗漏了某些细节
<19-11,BECKETT>Well, maybe we missed something.

816
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,390
<19-11,BECKETT>也许她把研究报告藏在某处了
<19-11,BECKETT>Maybe she hid it somewhere.

817
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,950
<19-11,BECKETT>又或许马特对研究报告的事撒了谎
<19-11,BECKETT>Or maybe Matt is lying about the research.

818
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,800
<20-1,BECKETT>你没见过一叠论文吗
<20-1,BECKETT>So you didn't see a stack of paperwork?

819
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,970
<20-2,DANIELLE>没有  有的话我会注意到
<20-2,DANIELLE>No, I would've noticed that.

820
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,620
<20-2,DANIELLE>-也许她带回学校了  -那里也没有
<20-2,DANIELLE>- Maybe she took them up to school? - No, it wasn't there either.

821
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,440
<20-4,DANIELLE>你们确定马特说的是实话吗
<20-4,DANIELLE>Are you sure Matt's telling the truth?

822
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,250
<20-5,CASTLE>大多数人为了不被怀疑而撒谎
<20-5,CASTLE>Most people lie to avoid suspicion.

823
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,560
<20-5,CASTLE>但很少人会撒谎让自己有罪
<20-5,CASTLE>Not a lot of people lie to incriminate themselves.

824
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,720
<20-6,BECKETT>你回到家的那天晚上
<20-6,BECKETT>That night that you came home,

825
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,540
<20-6,BECKETT>有没有留意到不同或东西放错
<20-6,BECKETT>did you notice anything different or out of place?

826
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,510
<20-7,DANIELLE>说起这个  我确实发现有些奇怪
<20-7,DANIELLE>Now that you mention it, I did find something odd.

827
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,220
<20-7,DANIELLE>今天我收拾洗碗机时
<20-7,DANIELLE>Earlier today I was emptying the dishwasher,

828
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,320
<20-7,DANIELLE>我发现一个酒杯  上面沾有口红印
<20-7,DANIELLE>and I found a wine glass with lipstick on it.

829
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,440
<20-7,DANIELLE>看起来不像是杰西卡的
<20-7,DANIELLE>It didn't seem like Jessica's shade,

830
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,770
<20-7,DANIELLE>也不是我的
<20-7,DANIELLE>and it wasn't one of mine.

831
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,600
<20-7,DANIELLE>我放到一边  打算迟点手洗
<20-7,DANIELLE>I put it aside to hand-wash it later.

832
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,500
<20-8,BECKETT>认得这颜色吗
<20-8,BECKETT>Recognize this shade?

833
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,240
<20-9,CASTLE>如果没搞错  也不可能错
<20-9,CASTLE>If I'm not mistaken, and I rarely am,

834
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,930
<20-9,CASTLE>那是"血色女王"
<20-9,CASTLE>That's Mistress Red.

835
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,690
<21-1,BECKETT>你知道吗  唇印跟指纹相似
<21-1,BECKETT>Did you know that lip prints are a lot like fingerprints?

836
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,990
<21-1,BECKETT>绝对是独一无二的
<21-1,BECKETT>No two are exactly alike.

837
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,550
<21-3,BECKETT>我们在杰西卡公寓里
<21-3,BECKETT>We found this on a wine glass

838
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,380
<21-3,BECKETT>一个酒杯上找到的
<21-3,BECKETT>in Jessica's apartment.

839
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,940
<21-3,BECKETT>当我们比对过你的嘴唇后  将有何发现
<21-3,BECKETT>What do you think we'll find when we compare it to your lips?

840
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,690
<21-4,LADY IRENA>-这唇印可能数月前就印上去了  -绝对不是
<21-4,LADY IRENA>- That stain could've been there for months.  - But it wasn't.

841
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,440
<21-5,BECKETT>我们查过用车服务
<21-5,BECKETT>We checked with your... car service.

842
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,680
<21-6,CASTLE>他们确认晚上9点把你载到
<21-6,CASTLE>They said they dropped you off at 9:00 P.M.

843
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,380
<21-6,CASTLE>杰西卡住所前  就在她被杀当晚
<21-6,CASTLE>in front of Jessica's place the night she was killed.

844
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,170
<21-7,BECKETT>你是最后一个见过她的人
<21-7,BECKETT>You were the last one to see her alive.

845
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,020
<21-7,BECKETT>那晚发生了什么
<21-7,BECKETT>What happened that night?

846
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,470
<21-8,CASTLE>你发现了她的真实身份吗
<21-8,CASTLE>Did you find out who she really was?

847
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,520
<21-8,CASTLE>她未经客户同意就对其进行研究
<21-8,CASTLE>That she was studying her clients without their permission?

848
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,090
<21-8,CASTLE>如果这泄露出去
<21-8,CASTLE>I mean, if word of that got out...

849
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,740
<21-8,CASTLE>对你生意是致命打击
<21-8,CASTLE>that would've destroyed your business.

850
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,200
<21-8,CASTLE>那会使你不高兴
<21-8,CASTLE>That can't have made you happy.

851
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,840
<21-9,LADY IRENA>你自以为抓了根救命稻草
<21-9,LADY IRENA>And you're grasping at straws,

852
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,270
<21-9,LADY IRENA>也没什么可高兴的
<21-9,LADY IRENA>and that can't make you happy.

853
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,680
<21-9,LADY IRENA>探长  这个时候
<21-9,LADY IRENA>Detective, at this time,

854
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,960
<21-9,LADY IRENA>我要求律师到场
<21-9,LADY IRENA>I'm exercising my right to legal counsel.

855
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,260
<21-9,LADY IRENA>我不会再回答任何问题
<21-9,LADY IRENA>I won't be answering any further questions.

856
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,560
<22-1,RYAN>对伊琳娜夫人的审问如何
<22-1,RYAN>How'd it go with lady Irena?

857
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,550
<22-2,BECKETT>她摆出律师的架势
<22-2,BECKETT>She's lawyering up.

858
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,220
<22-2,BECKETT>你们在杰西卡公寓有何发现
<22-2,BECKETT>What'd you guys find at Jessica's apartment?

859
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,750
<22-3,ESPOSITO>我们好像找到了罪案现场
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Well, it looks like we found the crime scene.

860
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,800
<22-3,ESPOSITO>伊琳娜对善后工作相当在行
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Irena was pretty good at cleaning up after herself.

861
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,560
<22-3,ESPOSITO>没有打斗痕迹  没有血迹
<22-3,ESPOSITO>There was no trace or blood evidence,

862
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,130
<22-3,ESPOSITO>但杰西卡的床头柜附近
<22-3,ESPOSITO>but the area around Jessica's bedside table

863
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,890
<22-3,ESPOSITO>火花曾像圣诞树那样耀眼
<22-3,ESPOSITO>lit up like a christmas tree.

864
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,160
<22-3,ESPOSITO>地板还用漂白剂擦洗过
<22-3,ESPOSITO>It'd been scrubbed down with bleach.

865
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,800
<22-4,BECKETT>难怪我们找不到杰西卡的研究报告
<22-4,BECKETT>That's why we didn't find Jessica's research.

866
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,130
<22-4,BECKETT>伊琳娜处理掉了一切证据
<22-4,BECKETT>Irena got rid of it all.

867
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,010
<22-5,RYAN>没错  但她并未处理干净
<22-5,RYAN>Yeah, but she didn't quite clean everything.

868
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,030
<22-5,RYAN>鉴证组把床罩等清空进行取样化验
<22-5,RYAN>Once C.S.U. stripped the bed, the swab test

869
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,010
<22-5,RYAN>结果表明一个枕头上留有
<22-5,RYAN>revealed dried saliva in one of her pillows

870
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,090
<22-5,RYAN>她被窒息时尖叫所留下的唾液
<22-5,RYAN>from her screams as she was smothered.

871
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,760
<22-6,CASTLE>看来她是不择手段地保护生意
<22-6,CASTLE>Looks like she'd do anything to protect her business,

872
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,230
<22-6,CASTLE>杀人也在所不惜
<22-6,CASTLE>even kill.

873
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,860
<22-7,BECKETT>管她是不是律师  逮捕她
<22-7,BECKETT>All right, lawyer or not, let's book her.

874
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,750
<22-8,RYAN>行动
<22-8,RYAN>Let's do it.

875
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,020
<23-1,MARTHA>你在滤水  还是考验我的耐心
<23-1,MARTHA>Are you straining those noodles or just my patience?

876
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,220
<23-2,CASTLE>抱歉  只是
<23-2,CASTLE>Oh, I'm... sorry. Just...

877
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,040
<23-2,CASTLE>这个案子
<23-2,CASTLE>Hmm. This case.

878
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,880
<23-2,CASTLE>我一直在想出了什么纰漏
<23-2,CASTLE>I keep thinking that I'm missing something.

879
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,650
<23-3,MARTHA>我也是  忘了放盐
<23-3,MARTHA>Yeah, me, too. Salt.

880
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,150
<23-4,CASTLE>这会钠中毒的
<23-4,CASTLE>Can you die from sodium poisoning?

881
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,870
<23-5,MARTHA>有道理
<23-5,MARTHA>Ooh. You have a point.

882
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,190
<23-6,ALEXIS>闻起来不错
<23-6,ALEXIS>Hey, that smells good.

883
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,620
<23-7,ALEXIS>但我吃过了
<23-7,ALEXIS>But... I already ate?

884
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,150
<23-8,MARTHA>不是吧
<23-8,MARTHA>Oh, no.

885
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,520
<23-9,CASTLE>你和阿什莉进行了啦啦队排练吗
<23-9,CASTLE>So did you and Ashley do cheerleading practice?

886
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,660
<23-10,ALEXIS>没有  没想到
<23-10,ALEXIS>Uh, no. Turns out,

887
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,420
<23-10,ALEXIS>啦啦队和我的击剑课
<23-10,ALEXIS>cheerleading conflicts with my fencing schedule,

888
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,040
<23-10,ALEXIS>小提琴课还有法语俱乐部撞车了
<23-10,ALEXIS>my violin lessons and french club.

889
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,810
<23-10,ALEXIS>啦啦队更像一种生活方式
<23-10,ALEXIS>Cheerleading is more of a lifestyle.

890
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,080
<23-10,ALEXIS>我可以看个热闹
<23-10,ALEXIS>And as much as I like to visit,

891
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,750
<23-10,ALEXIS>却不一定要参与
<23-10,ALEXIS>it's not really a place I'd like to live.

892
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,720
<23-11,MARTHA>我说过她会自己想通的
<23-11,MARTHA>I told you she'd figure it out.

893
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,540
<23-12,CASTLE>今天我们都上了宝贵一课
<23-12,CASTLE>Well, we both learned a valuable lesson today.

894
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,660
<23-12,CASTLE>你知道自己可以开阔眼界和成长
<23-12,CASTLE>You learned that you can expand your horizons and grow.

895
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,420
<23-12,CASTLE>而我知道了如果涉及超短裙和男生
<23-12,CASTLE>I learned that if that involves short skirts and boys,

896
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,530
<23-13,ALEXIS>-我不会喜欢的  -明白
<23-13,ALEXIS>- I'm not gonna like it.  - Fair enough.

897
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,070
<23-14,MARTHA>很好  你们都吸取了教训
<23-14,MARTHA>Fine. Now that you've both learned your lessons,

898
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,740
<23-14,MARTHA>开始洗碗如何
<23-14,MARTHA>how about starting on the dishes?

899
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,950
<23-15,CASTLE>你需要一个消防大水管才能洗干净
<23-15,CASTLE>You're gonna need a fire hose to clean this up.

900
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,470
<23-16,MARTHA>不  我做饭  你收拾
<23-16,MARTHA>No, I cooked. Someone else cleans up.

901
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,000
<23-17,CASTLE>收拾
<23-17,CASTLE>Clean up.

902
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,690
<24-1,CASTLE>-谁洗了枕套  -什么
<24-1,CASTLE>- Who washed the pillowcase?  - What?

903
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,330
<24-3,CASTLE>埃斯波西托说鉴证组在把床罩等清空
<24-3,CASTLE>Esposito said C.S.U. didn't find anything

904
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,280
<24-3,CASTLE>取样前是一无所获
<24-3,CASTLE>until they stripped the bed.

905
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,500
<24-3,CASTLE>也就是说枕头上有唾液
<24-3,CASTLE>That means there was saliva on the pillow,

906
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,060
<24-3,CASTLE>但枕套上却没有
<24-3,CASTLE>but not on the pillowcase.

907
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,040
<24-4,BECKETT>没错  有人清洗了枕套
<24-4,BECKETT>You're right. Someone washed the pillowcase.

908
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,750
<24-4,BECKETT>但清洗烘干至少要1小时
<24-4,BECKETT>But the washer-dryer cycle would've taken at least an hour.

909
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,700
<24-5,CASTLE>这样的话  她室友必然回家了
<24-5,CASTLE>At which point, the roommate would've been home.

910
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,520
<24-6,BECKETT>伊琳娜不可能及时逃离现场
<24-6,BECKETT>Irena couldn't have gotten out in time.

911
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
<24-7,CASTLE>只有一个人可以把公寓收拾干净
<24-7,CASTLE>Only one person could've cleaned the apartment.

912
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,170
<25-1,DANIELLE>我不明白
<25-1,DANIELLE>I-I don't understand.

913
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,900
<25-1,DANIELLE>我以为你们已经抓到凶手
<25-1,DANIELLE>I thought you'd caught the killer.

914
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,890
<25-2,BECKETT>我们也以为是
<25-2,BECKETT>We thought so, too.

915
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,350
<25-3,DANIELLE>若不是她  又会是谁
<25-3,DANIELLE>If it wasn't her, then who?

916
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,700
<25-4,BECKETT>是你  丹妮尔
<25-4,BECKETT>It was you, Danielle.

917
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,590
<25-4,BECKETT>我
<25-4,BECKETT>Me?

918
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,590
<25-5,DANIELLE>我为什么要杀害最好的朋友
<25-5,DANIELLE>Oh, why would I kill my best friend?

919
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,320
<25-5,DANIELLE>在她的研究中
<25-5,DANIELLE>In her research,

920
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,580
<25-6,CASTLE>杰西卡写道自己身处不正常的恋情中
<25-6,CASTLE>Jessica describes being in a dysfunctional relationship.

921
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,790
<25-6,CASTLE>她不敢离去
<25-6,CASTLE>One she was scared to leave

922
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,290
<25-6,CASTLE>因为对方施以危险性纠缠
<25-6,CASTLE>because the other person had become so dangerously codependent.

923
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,950
<25-7,BECKETT>我们最初以为是她男友泰勒
<25-7,BECKETT>At first we thought it was her boyfriend Tyler.

924
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,390
<25-7,BECKETT>但其实不是
<25-7,BECKETT>But it wasn't, was it?

925
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,790
<25-8,DANIELLE>我不明白你在说什么
<25-8,DANIELLE>I don't know what you're talking about.

926
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:07,330
<25-9,BECKETT>马特放下的研究报告  她的研究报告
<25-9,BECKETT>The research that Matt dropped off--her research--

927
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,500
<25-9,BECKETT>她对你的描写
<25-9,BECKETT>Must've been very hurtful

928
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,050
<25-9,BECKETT>读来必定让人伤心欲绝
<25-9,BECKETT>to read all the things that she wrote about you.

929
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,610
<25-10,DANIELLE>杰西卡爱我  她绝不会伤害我
<25-10,DANIELLE>Jessica loved me. She would never hurt me.

930
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,540
<25-11,CASTLE>人物乙显示了性受虐狂的一切症状
<25-11,CASTLE>"Subject 'b' shows all the signs of being a masochist,

931
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,020
<25-11,CASTLE>完全依赖其自我感觉
<25-11,CASTLE>completely dependent for her sense of self."

932
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,660
<25-12,BECKETT>我们知道你读了那些资料  丹妮尔
<25-12,BECKETT>We know you read the files, Danielle.

933
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,780
<25-12,BECKETT>所以你才那样处置她的尸体
<25-12,BECKETT>That's why you staged her body that way.

934
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,510
<25-13,DANIELLE>不  我没有看  这里没什么资料
<25-13,DANIELLE>No, I didn't read anything. There was nothing here.

935
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,930
<25-14,BECKETT>因为你把一切都烧掉了
<25-14,BECKETT>Because you got rid of it all.

936
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,190
<25-15,DANIELLE>-你错了  -就是你  丹妮尔
<25-15,DANIELLE>- You're wrong.  - It had to have been you, Danielle.

937
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,780
<25-16,BECKETT>你是唯一有时间清理现场的人
<25-16,BECKETT>You were the only one who had time to clean up after yourself.

938
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,450
<25-17,CASTLE>从她的办公地方判断  杰西卡不是那种
<25-17,CASTLE>Judging from her office space, Jessica wasn't the kind of girl

939
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,510
<25-17,CASTLE>会用漂白剂擦地的人
<25-17,CASTLE>that scrubbed her floor clean with bleach.

940
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,390
<25-17,CASTLE>杰西卡告诉你  她必须离开你
<25-17,CASTLE>Jessica told you... she had to get away from you.

941
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,830
<25-17,CASTLE>她告诉你  她要离开
<25-17,CASTLE>She told you... she was gonna leave.

942
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,830
<25-17,CASTLE>她
<25-17,CASTLE>She...

943
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,570
<25-18,DANIELLE>她是我的一切
<25-18,DANIELLE>She was... everything to me.

944
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,690
<25-18,DANIELLE>我以为我们是家人
<25-18,DANIELLE>I thought we were family.

945
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,620
<25-18,DANIELLE>但她写了那些可怕的文字
<25-18,DANIELLE>But then she wrote those awful things!

946
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,360
<25-18,DANIELLE>她没有权利
<25-18,DANIELLE>She had no right.

947
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,260
<25-19,BECKETT>那天晚上发生了什么
<25-19,BECKETT>What happened that night?

948
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,390
<25-20,DANIELLE>她说她要搬出去
<25-20,DANIELLE>She said she was... gonna move out,

949
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,850
<25-20,DANIELLE>她和我再无瓜葛
<25-20,DANIELLE>that she was done with me.

950
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,470
<25-20,DANIELLE>我推了她
<25-20,DANIELLE>I pushed her.

951
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,080
<25-20,DANIELLE>她跌倒了
<25-20,DANIELLE>She fell.

952
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,980
<25-20,DANIELLE>头部撞到桌子
<25-20,DANIELLE>Her head... hit the table.

953
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,250
<25-20,DANIELLE>她开始尖叫
<25-20,DANIELLE>She started to scream.

954
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,600
<25-20,DANIELLE>她说  她恨我
<25-20,DANIELLE>She said--she said she hated me!

955
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,790
<25-20,DANIELLE>我叫她闭嘴  我只是想让她闭嘴
<25-20,DANIELLE>I told her to shut up! I just wanted her to shut up.

956
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,710
<25-21,BECKETT>然后你把枕头压在她头上
<25-21,BECKETT>And then you put a pillow over her head

957
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,120
<25-21,BECKETT>使她窒息而亡
<25-21,BECKETT>and you suffocated her.

958
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,350
<25-22,DANIELLE>我不是有意要杀她的
<25-22,DANIELLE>I... I didn't mean to kill her.

959
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,100
<25-22,DANIELLE>我只是不想让她走
<25-22,DANIELLE>I just didn't want her to go.

960
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,830
<26-1,BECKETT>最终  卡塞尔是对的
<26-1,BECKETT>In the end, Castle was right.

961
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:57,320
<26-1,BECKETT>这宗谋杀案是冲动犯罪
<26-1,BECKETT>The murder was a crime of passion.

962
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,680
<26-1,BECKETT>手铐  焦糖都是烟雾弹
<26-1,BECKETT>The cuffs, the caramel were all just theater to throw us off.

963
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,870
<26-2,CASTLE>我不禁在想
<26-2,CASTLE>I can't help but think

964
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,250
<26-2,CASTLE>如果马特没有复印杰西卡的研究报告
<26-2,CASTLE>that if Matt hadn't copied Jessica's research,

965
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,790
<26-2,CASTLE>丹妮尔也永远不会看到
<26-2,CASTLE>Danielle never would've read it,

966
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,850
<26-2,CASTLE>这一切都不会发生
<26-2,CASTLE>none of this woulda happened.

967
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,080
<26-3,MONTGOMERY>马特现在是奖学金和学位都泡汤了
<26-3,MONTGOMERY>Well, now he won't get his precious little fellowship or his degree.

968
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,250
<26-3,MONTGOMERY>伊琳娜夫人呢  她去公寓里干什么
<26-3,MONTGOMERY>What about Lady Irena? What was she doing at the apartment?

969
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,420
<26-4,BECKETT>有些女郎认为杰西卡捞外快
<26-4,BECKETT>Some of the girls thought that Jessica was working off the books.

970
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,710
<26-4,BECKETT>伊琳娜过去叫她停止
<26-4,BECKETT>So Irena came by to tell her to knock it off.

971
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,380
<26-5,CASTLE>她们喝了杯红酒  她就离开了
<26-5,CASTLE>They had a glass of wine, and she left.

972
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,940
<26-5,CASTLE>她只是没挑对时间去
<26-5,CASTLE>She just did it on the wrong night.

973
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,520
<26-6,MONTGOMERY>没错  但她为何为难你呢
<26-6,MONTGOMERY>Yeah, but why'd she give you such a hard time, then?

974
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,540
<26-7,BECKETT>因为她是律师
<26-7,BECKETT>Because she's a lawyer.

975
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,430
<26-8,CASTLE>还是位"女王"
<26-8,CASTLE>And a dominatrix.
