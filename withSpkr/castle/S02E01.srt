75
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,590
<1-22,BECKETT>因为我不想在酒吧领薪水

<1-29,CASTLE>另外  市长认为这家媒体不错
<1-29,CASTLE>And, and, well, the mayor thought it would be good press.

84
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,520
<1-30,BECKETT>没必要解释这些
<1-30,BECKETT>You don't have to explain yourself.

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,940
<2-15,LANIE>从折断的树枝判断
<2-15,LANIE>Judging from the cracked branches,

126
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,490
<2-15,LANIE>他应该是模仿超人
<2-15,LANIE>I'm guessing he did a superman off

127
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,820
<2-15,LANIE>从那栋楼的楼顶跳下
<2-15,LANIE>the top of that building.

128
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,550
<2-16,ESPOSITO>死者名叫约翰·艾伦
<2-16,ESPOSITO>Vic's name is John Allen.

129
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,460

<2-16,ESPOSITO>I.D. has him on the upper west side.

<2-16,ESPOSITO>名片显示他从事保险业
<2-16,ESPOSITO>Business card has him in insurance.

131
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,600
<2-17,AMY>他是自杀吗
<2-17,AMY>Is it a suicide?

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,670
<2-17,AMY>-不是  -不是
<2-17,AMY>- It's not a suicide. - It's not a suicide.

133
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,030
<2-18,AMY>为什么
<2-18,AMY>How do you know?

134
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,040
<2-19,BECKETT>这栋楼不够高
<2-19,BECKETT>Um, the building is too short.

135
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,110
<2-19,BECKETT>除非他想摔成残废  而不是想自杀
<2-19,BECKETT>He'd want to kill himself, not cripple himself.

136
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,450
<2-20,CASTLE>要寻死
<2-20,CASTLE>Well, if you want to die,

137
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,540
<2-20,CASTLE>会选择水泥地  不会往树上跳
<2-20,CASTLE>you're gonna aim for concrete, not a tree.

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,870
<2-20,CASTLE>从跌落的角度判断
<2-20,CASTLE>Judging from angle of descent,

139
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,850
<2-20,CASTLE>我判断死者应该是被扔下楼的
<2-20,CASTLE>I'd say that guy was thrown off the building.

140
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,790
<2-21,BECKETT>既然很明显这不是自杀
<2-21,BECKETT>Since it clearly wasn't a suicide,

141
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,090
<2-21,BECKETT>那他的死因是什么
<2-21,BECKETT>how did he die?

142
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,400
<2-22,LANIE>脖子有被勒过的痕迹
<2-22,LANIE>There are signs of strangulation.

143
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,860
<2-22,LANIE>看来气管是断了
<2-22,LANIE>It looks like his windpipe was crushed.

144
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,140
<2-23,BECKETT>有没有绑缚物的痕迹
<2-23,BECKETT>Any ligature marks?

145
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,850
<2-24,LANIE>-看不出  -绑缚物指的是
<2-24,LANIE>- Nope.-"Ligature" refers to

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,610
<2-25,CASTLE>能捆绑的东西  比如绳子或者皮带
<2-25,CASTLE>Anything that ties or binds, like a rope or a belt.

147
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,600
<2-25,CASTLE>没有绑缚物的痕迹  表示他是被用手掐死的
<2-25,CASTLE>Lack of any marks suggests he was strangled by hand.

148
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,350
<2-26,AMY>你懂的真多
<2-26,AMY>Wow. You really know your stuff.

149
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,900
<2-26,AMY>难怪警方喜欢带着你
<2-26,AMY>No wonder they like having you around.

150
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,080
<2-27,BECKETT>他确实是不可多得的人才
<2-27,BECKETT>You know what? He's such an incredible resource,

151
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,280
<2-27,BECKETT>在这里简直太浪费他的才干了
<2-27,BECKETT>It seems like a shame to waste his talents here in the field.

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,700
<2-27,BECKETT>你不介意跟随帕里什医生去停尸房吧
<2-27,BECKETT>Would you mind going back to the morgue with dr. Parish

153
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,860
<2-27,BECKETT>看看在死者身上还有什么线索
<2-27,BECKETT>To see what else we can find out about the vic?

154
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,050
<2-28,CASTLE>你不觉得我在案发现场帮助更大吗
<2-28,CASTLE>Don't you think I 'd be of more use here at the crime scene?

155
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,290
<2-29,BECKETT>不会  我们就敲敲门
<2-29,BECKETT>Oh, no. We're just gonna knock on doors

156
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,750
<2-29,BECKETT>看看能否查到什么
<2-29,BECKETT>And see what else we can stir up.

157
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,380
<2-29,BECKETT>只是无聊的警察工作
<2-29,BECKETT>You know, boring police stuff.

158
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,270
<2-30,CASTLE>好的  但关于小马的事我是认真的
<2-30,CASTLE>Fine. But I was serious about the pony.

159
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,600
<2-30,CASTLE>这边  我领你参观移动停尸房
<2-30,CASTLE>Come on, I'll show you the, uh, morgue...mobile.

160
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,840
<2-31,BECKETT>-钱包里有什么线索吗  -没有
<2-31,BECKETT>- Anything in the wallet? - No.

161
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,040
<2-32,RYAN>只有干洗的票据  身份证和信用卡
<2-32,RYAN>Dry cleaning tickets, I.D., two credit cards.

162
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,070
<2-32,RYAN>但现金没有了
<2-32,RYAN>Cash was missing, though.

163
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,920
<2-33,BECKETT>这可完全不是抢劫
<2-33,BECKETT>That's a long way to go for a robbery.

164
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,010
<2-34,AMY>难道我们要和尸体一起坐车
<2-34,AMY>You mean we have to ride with the body?

165
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,440
<2-35,LANIE>你可以坐我在前排的座位
<2-35,LANIE>You can take my seat up front.

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,460
<2-36,AMY>真的吗
<2-36,AMY>You sure?

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,680
<2-37,LANIE>是的  我习惯了和尸体在一起
<2-37,LANIE>Mm-hmm. I'm used to hanging out with stiffs.

168
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,450
<2-39,LANIE>你不用跟我套近乎
<2-39,LANIE>Unh-unh. You do not get to say hi to me.

169
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,870
<2-39,LANIE>我只是帮我的朋友而已
<2-39,LANIE>I'm just doing my girl a favor.

170
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,100
<2-40,CASTLE>你也这样吗
<2-40,CASTLE>Oh, you, too, huh?

171
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,460
<2-40,CASTLE>你以为呢
<2-40,CASTLE>Well, what did you expect?

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,230
<2-41,LANIE>贝克特当警察的头三年里
<2-41,LANIE>Beckett spent the first three years of being a cop

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,740
<2-41,LANIE>都在努力查清她母亲的案子
<2-41,LANIE>Trying to solve her mother's murder.

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,680
<2-41,LANIE>她付出很多才能放下这事
<2-41,LANIE>It took everything that she had to put it behind her.

175
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,770
<2-41,LANIE>你不能尊重她的感受吗
<2-41,LANIE>You couldn't respect that?

176
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,200
<2-42,CASTLE>那我该怎么办
<2-42,CASTLE>What was I supposed to do,

177
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,180
<2-42,CASTLE>隐瞒我的发现吗
<2-42,CASTLE>Not tell her what I'd found?

178
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,930
<2-43,LANIE>你的发现
<2-43,LANIE>What you found?

179
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,180
<2-44,CASTLE>她没告诉你  是吗
<2-44,CASTLE>Oh, she didn't tell you, did she?

180
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,330
<2-44,CASTLE>有三名死者和她母亲的遭遇一样
<2-44,CASTLE>Three people were killed the same way her mother was

181
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,740
<2-44,CASTLE>而且时间大致相同
<2-44,CASTLE>Right about the same time.

182
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,710
<2-44,CASTLE>其中一个是她以前的法律系学生
<2-44,CASTLE>One of 'em was a former law student of hers.

183
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,620
<2-44,CASTLE>还有一个是文员
<2-44,CASTLE>Another one, a documents clerk.

184
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,780
<2-44,CASTLE>第三个是非盈利组织的律师
<2-44,CASTLE>The third one, a lawyer for a nonprofit.

185
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,890
<2-45,LANIE>等等  当时的法医
<2-45,LANIE>Wait, the M.E. at the time

186
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,990
<2-45,LANIE>没把这些线索联系起来吗
<2-45,LANIE>Didn't make the connection?

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
<2-46,CASTLE>如果发现了  也隐瞒了
<2-46,CASTLE>If he did, he buried it.

188
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,920
<2-47,LANIE>你和他谈过了吗
<2-47,LANIE>Did you talk to him?

189
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,480
<2-48,CASTLE>他四年前死了
<2-48,CASTLE>He died four years ago.

190
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,140
<2-48,CASTLE>所以我必须告诉她这些
<2-48,CASTLE>So you see why I had to tell her.

191
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,660
<2-49,LANIE>她说了什么
<2-49,LANIE>What did she say?

192
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,850
<2-50,CASTLE>她说我们结束了
<2-50,CASTLE>That we were done.

193
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,760
<2-50,CASTLE>然后她走到
<2-50,CASTLE>And then she just walked--

194
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,190
<2-50,CASTLE>都不许动  不许动
<2-50,CASTLE>Don't move! Don't move!

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,790
<2-51,CASTLE>快  快点
<2-51,CASTLE>Come on, move! Come on!

199
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,810
<2-51,CASTLE>是只有我觉得怪异
<2-51,CASTLE>Is it just me,

200
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,050
<2-51,CASTLE>还是这就是非常非常怪异
<2-51,CASTLE>Or was that really, really weird.

201

204
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,690
<3-4,LANIE>如果有  也是以前就造成的
<3-4,LANIE>If he has some, it happened way before tonight,

205
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,310
<3-4,LANIE>而且是他自己造成的
<3-4,LANIE>And it was probably self-inflicted.

206
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,770
<3-5,CASTLE>那些美好的时光啊
<3-5,CASTLE>Ahh. Good times.

261
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,250
<3-25,CASTLE>只有两晚
<3-25,CASTLE>It was just two nights.

262
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,020
<3-24,BECKETT>你最近是否发现有什么不对劲吗
<3-24,BECKETT>Did you notice anything unusual recently,

263
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,550
<3-24,BECKETT>他有没有什么奇怪的行为
<3-24,BECKETT>Any strange behavior?

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,430
<3-24,BECKETT>他加班到很晚
<3-24,BECKETT>Well, he, he had to work late

265
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,490
<3-24,BECKETT>比平时更晚一些
<3-24,BECKETT>A little more often than usual.

266
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,850
<3-24,BECKETT>但在现在的经济情况下  谁不是呢
<3-24,BECKETT>But I mean, in this economy, who doesn't?

267
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,730
<3-25,CASTLE>去年他被迫裁掉部门的一半员工
<3-25,CASTLE>He had to lay off half his department last year.

268
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,340
<3-25,CASTLE>你确定他是加班
<3-25,CASTLE>And you're sure he was working late?

269
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,900
<3-25,CASTLE>你什么意思  说他有外遇吗
<3-25,CASTLE>What are you saying, that he was cheating?

270
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,840
<3-25,CASTLE>每晚  他走进那扇门
<3-25,CASTLE>Every night, he would walk through that door,

271
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,210
<3-25,CASTLE>孩子们都跑进他的怀抱  知道吗
<3-25,CASTLE>And the kids would just race into his arms, okay?

272
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,570
<3-26,BECKETT>现在他不在了
<3-26,BECKETT>And now he's gone.

273
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,770
<3-26,BECKETT>所以别问我  他是否真的是在加班
<3-26,BECKETT>So don't ask me if he was really working late.

274
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,460
<3-26,BECKETT>告诉我他为什么遇害
<3-26,BECKETT>Tell me why he was killed.

275
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,280
<3-26,BECKETT>他不是这个意思
<3-26,BECKETT>He didn't mean to imply--

276
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,760
<3-27,CASTLE>-有没有人深夜给他打电话  -卡塞尔
<3-27,CASTLE>- What about phone calls, maybe late at night? - Castle.

277
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,850
<3-28,BECKETT>有的
<3-28,BECKETT>Yeah. Yeah. Um...

278
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,410
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>有个被约翰解雇的人
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>one of the guys that John fired--

279
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,740
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>马科斯·哈沃斯多克
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>Max Haverstock.

280
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,850
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>他有在深夜给我丈夫打电话
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>He would call hi late at night,

281
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,960
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>因为那些事  对他大吼大叫
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>And he would yell at him, all sorts of things.

282
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,500
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>我想他很痛苦  他需要钱
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>I guess he was hurting, he needed money.

283
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,970
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>我要约翰挂断他电话
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>And I, I told john that he should just hang up on him.

284
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,280
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>但约翰说不能
<3-29,MRS ALLEN>And john said no, he, he couldn't do that.

285
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,620
<3-30,BECKETT>约翰给他钱了吗
<3-30,BECKETT>Did he ever give him money?

286
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,710
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>我的丈夫不同意施舍
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>My husband didn't believe in handouts.

287
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,290
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>他认为人应该自力更生
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>He believed that a man should make his way.

288
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,180
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>我丈夫现在在哪里
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>Where is he?

289
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,800
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>我想跟他告别
<3-31,MRS ALLEN>I'd like to say good-bye.

290
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,160
<3-32,BECKETT>关于这件事
<3-32,BECKETT>About that. Um...

291
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,990
<3-33,CASTLE>真尴尬
<3-33,CASTLE>That was awkward.

292
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,180
<3-34,BECKETT>这根本无法理解
<3-34,BECKETT>it just, it doesn't make any sense.

293
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,690
<3-34,BECKETT>死者家庭是稳定的中产家庭
<3-34,BECKETT>The guy's got a stable, middle-class life--

294
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,990
<3-34,BECKETT>好工作  幸福的家庭
<3-34,BECKETT>Good job, good family.

295
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,910
<3-35,CASTLE>也许他的朋友马科斯嫉妒他
<3-35,CASTLE>Maybe his friend max was jealous.

296
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,010
<3-36,BECKETT>是的 也许嫉妒到足以谋杀
<3-36,BECKETT>Yeah, maybe enough to kill him,

297
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,910
<3-36,BECKETT>但至于偷尸体吗
<3-36,BECKETT>But to steal his body?

298
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,760
<3-36,BECKETT>埃斯波西托
<3-36,BECKETT>Hey, Esposito.

299
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,240
<3-36,BECKETT>你帮我查查受害人的一个朋友
<3-36,BECKETT>I need you to look up a friend of the vic.

300
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,800
<3-36,BECKETT>马科斯·哈沃斯多克
<3-36,BECKETT>Max Haverstock.

301
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,270
<3-36,BECKETT>找到他  再带过来
<3-36,BECKETT>Okay, find him and, uh, bring him in.

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,590
<4-1,ALEXIS>谢天谢地  你回来了  你还好吗
<4-1,ALEXIS>Dad. Thank god you're home. Are you okay?

303
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,970
<4-2,CASTLE>我很好  怎么了
<4-2,CASTLE>Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

304
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,190
<4-3,ALEXIS>很好  我们听说有蒙面持枪歹徒抢尸体
<4-3,ALEXIS>Fine? Masked gunmen, body snatchers?

305
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,100
<4-3,ALEXIS>我快给你发了一千条短信了
<4-3,ALEXIS>I texted you like a thousand times.

306
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,250
<4-4,CASTLE>对不起  一定是关机了
<4-4,CASTLE>Oh, I'm sorry. My phone must've been off.

307
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:54,920
<4-4,CASTLE>你们怎么知道的
<4-4,CASTLE>How--how did you know?

308
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,030
<4-5,ALEXIS>贝克特打电话了
<4-5,ALEXIS>Beckett called.

309
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,340
<4-6,CASTLE>真的
<4-6,CASTLE>Really?

310
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,470
<4-7,MARTHA>她只是想让我们知道你们没事
<4-7,MARTHA>She just wanted to let us know you were all right.

311
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,610
<4-9,MARTHA>这么说她原谅你了
<4-9,MARTHA>So has she forgiven you?

312
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,400
<4-10,CASTLE>还没有  不过我在努力
<4-10,CASTLE>Uh, not exactly, mother. But I'm working on it.

313
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,840
<4-10,CASTLE>她同意我帮助处理这件案子
<4-10,CASTLE>She has agreed to let me help on the case.

314
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,370
<4-11,MARTHA>我想这是个不错的开始
<4-11,MARTHA>Well, that's a start, I suppose.

315
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,790
<4-12,CASTLE>不仅仅是开始  更是一次机会
<4-12,CASTLE>It is more than a start. It is an opportunity.

316
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,240
<4-12,CASTLE>她可能在我们之间竖起了一面高墙
<4-12,CASTLE>She may have built a wall between us,

317
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,510
<4-12,CASTLE>那我就要在这面墙上修一扇门
<4-12,CASTLE>But I am going to...build a door in that wall,

318
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,100
<4-12,CASTLE>要么就摆上一个梯子  要么挖个大洞
<4-12,CASTLE>Or put up a ladder or dig a hole.

319
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,840
<4-13,MARTHA>那你有法子了吗
<4-13,MARTHA>You have a strategy?

320
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,340
<4-14,CASTLE>惯用手法  用气质迷倒她
<4-14,CASTLE>Be my usual, charming self.

321
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,860
<4-15,MARTHA>有方案二吗
<4-15,MARTHA>Uh-huh. What about plan "B"?

322
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,590
<4-16,ALEXIS>情况很糟吧  你当时害怕吗
<4-16,ALEXIS>So was it awful? Were you scared?

323
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,930
<4-17,CASTLE>我  害怕
<4-17,CASTLE>Me, scared?

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,250
<4-17,CASTLE>不可能  得了吧
<4-17,CASTLE>No way. Come on.

325
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,700
<4-17,CASTLE>-抱歉我得去换个短裤  -爸爸
<4-17,CASTLE>- Now excuse me while I change my shorts. - Dad.

326
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,540
<4-19,CASTLE>好  我是很害怕  还好他们只要尸体
<4-19,CASTLE>No, I was scared. But all they were after was the body.

327
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,500
<4-20,ALEXIS>-为什么  -我也想问为什么
<4-20,ALEXIS>- Why? - Why indeed.

<4-21,CASTLE>老爸  你在哪里  老爸  你还好吗
<4-21,CASTLE>"Dad, where are you? Dad, are you all right?

<4-21,CASTLE>老爸  马上回电话
<4-21,CASTLE>"Dad, call us right away.

<4-21,CASTLE>老爸  周五我能和欧文
<4-21,CASTLE>Dad, can I go see 'fame'

331
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,130
<4-21,CASTLE>一起去看《名扬四海》吗
<4-21,CASTLE>With Owen on Friday?"

332
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,900
<4-21,CASTLE>你的关心很感人
<4-21,CASTLE>Your concern is touching.

333
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
<4-22,ALEXIS>这条是我知道你没事之后发的
<4-22,ALEXIS>Okay, that one was after I knew you were all right.

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
<4-23,CASTLE>我还以为我们一起去看的
<4-23,CASTLE>Yeah, but I thought we were gonna go see that together.

335
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,070
<4-24,ALEXIS>还是可以的
<4-24,ALEXIS>We were, and we still can.

336
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,910
<4-24,ALEXIS>但是他邀请我下周五一起去看
<4-24,ALEXIS>But he invited me to go see it with me next Friday.

337
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,550
<4-25,CASTLE>你宁愿跟男朋友一起  而抛弃自己的老爸
<4-25,CASTLE>You'd rather go with your boyfriend than your dad?

338
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,710
<4-25,CASTLE>你怎么搞的
<4-25,CASTLE>What is wrong with you?

339
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,520
<4-26,ALEXIS>如果你真想跟我一起去  我就跟你去
<4-26,ALEXIS>If you really want me to go with you, I will.

340
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,620
<4-27,CASTLE>不必了  你跟欧文说这次他赢了
<4-27,CASTLE>No, no. You tell Owen he has won this round.

341
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,100
<4-27,CASTLE>不过你要跟我一起看《圣诞欢歌》
<4-27,CASTLE>but I got dibs on "A Christmas Carol."

342
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,220
<4-28,ALEXIS>谢谢老爸
<4-28,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad.

<4-28,ALEXIS>-真高兴你没被那些人杀死  -我也是
<4-28,ALEXIS>- And I'm glad you weren't killed by body snatchers. - Me, too.

344
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,710
<4-30,MARTHA>好莱坞除了重拍这两部电影
<4-30,MARTHA>Oh, they remade "Fame" and "A Christmas Carol."

345
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,790
<4-30,MARTHA>就没有其他好点子了吗
<4-30,MARTHA>Has Hollywood totally run out of ideas?

346
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,240
<4-31,CASTLE>他们刚决定把游戏《星际大战》拍成电影
<4-31,CASTLE>Well, they just optioned, uh,"Asteroids" the video game.

347
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,310
<4-31,CASTLE>所以我同意你的看法
<4-31,CASTLE>So my guess is yes.

348
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,700
<4-31,CASTLE>但瑞安·雷诺兹正在拍一部三角爱情戏
<4-31,CASTLE>But Ryan Reynolds is playing the wee triangle,

349
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,350
<4-31,CASTLE>他演得还不错
<4-31,CASTLE>And he's good.

350
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,150
<5-1,BECKETT>你确定是这个人吗

<5-2,ESPOSITO>马科斯威尔·哈沃斯多克
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Maxwell Haverstock.

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,470
<5-2,ESPOSITO>他承认认识被害人
<5-2,ESPOSITO>And he confirmed he knew the vic.

353
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,080
<5-3,CASTLE>这家伙从屋顶  丢块湿海绵都丢不动
<5-3,CASTLE>This guy couldn't throw a wet sponge off the roof

354
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,170
<5-3,CASTLE>更别说丢尸体了
<5-3,CASTLE>Let alone a body.

355

<6-2,MAX HAVERSTOCK>-哈沃斯多克先生  -是我
<6-2,MAX HAVERSTOCK>- Mr. Haverstock. - Yes.

356
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,730
<6-3,BECKETT>知道为什么请你来这吗
<6-3,BECKETT>Do you know why you're here?

357
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,510
<6-4,MAX HAVERSTOCK>不知道  他们只说要我来
<6-4,MAX HAVERSTOCK>No. Uh, they just told me I needed to come in.

358
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,860
<6-5,BECKETT>是关于约翰·艾伦的事  昨晚他被谋杀了
<6-5,BECKETT>It's about John Allen. He was murdered last night.

359
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,030
<6-6,MAX HAVERSTOCK>太可怕了
<6-6,MAX HAVERSTOCK>Oh, that's terrible.

360
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,470
<6-7,BECKETT>-你跟他是朋友吗  -我在他隔壁办公
<6-7,BECKETT>- You and he were friends? - Uh, we had adjoining cubicles.

361
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,690
<6-9,BECKETT>你最后一次看到他是什么时候
<6-9,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw him?

362
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,700
<6-10,MAX HAVERSTOCK>自从行动日之后就没见过
<6-10,MAX HAVERSTOCK>Oh, uh, not since "D" day.

363
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,950
<6-10,MAX HAVERSTOCK>我们都这么叫
<6-10,MAX HAVERSTOCK>That's, uh, that's what we called it.

364
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,750
<6-11,BECKETT>-行动代表裁员  -你被裁了吗
<6-11,BECKETT>- You know, "d" for downsizing. - You were let go?

365
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,640
<6-13,BECKETT>-是的  -我猜你肯定愤愤不平
<6-13,BECKETT>- Yeah. - I bet that made you pretty angry.

366
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,690
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>是啊  我们一起工作了十五年
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>Yeah, 15 years, we worked there together.

367
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,660
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>人们都认为这有特殊意义
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>You know, you'd think that would mean something.

368
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,980
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>会觉得忠诚比其他一切都重要
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>You'd think that loyalty would be worth something.

369
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,390
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>你们懂吗  这是防备不及的重大挫折
<6-14,MAX HAVERSTOCK>You know what it's worth? A kick in the teeth!

370
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,390
<6-15,BECKETT>你跟约翰打电话说过这些吗
<6-15,BECKETT>Did you ever call and tell john that?

371
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,380
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>一直都这样  我跟他说过
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>Oh, yeah, all the time. Yeah, I told him

372
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,890
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>我们不该就这样被裁掉
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>We didn't deserve to be treated like that.

373
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,830
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>我跟他发誓  总有一天咸鱼会翻身的
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>But I promised him, one day, rhe worm would turn,

374
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,890
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>因为命运是个可恶的小贱人
<6-16,MAX HAVERSTOCK>'Cause karma's a nasty little bitch.

375
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,510
<6-17,BECKETT>你杀他就是因为这个
<6-17,BECKETT>Is that why you killed him?

376
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,460
<6-19,BECKETT>-杀谁  -约翰
<6-19,BECKETT>- Who? - John.

377
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,880
<6-20,MAX HAVERSTOCK>我为什么杀约翰
<6-20,MAX HAVERSTOCK>Why would I want to kill john?

378
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,740
<6-21,BECKETT>因为炒了你
<6-21,BECKETT>For firing you.

379
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,180
<6-22,MAX HAVERSTOCK>他没有炒我  我们在行动日一起被炒了
<6-22,MAX HAVERSTOCK>He didn't fire me. We were let go together on "d" day.

380
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,630
<6-22,MAX HAVERSTOCK>幸运的是我找到了另一份工作
<6-22,MAX HAVERSTOCK>Uh, fortunately, I was able to find another job.

381
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,020
<6-23,BECKETT>他没有工作吗
<6-23,BECKETT>He didn't have a job?

382
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,820
<6-24,MAX HAVERSTOCK>我想他没有再找
<6-24,MAX HAVERSTOCK>I guess he, uh, doesn't have to look for one anymore.

383
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,300
<6-25,ESPOSITO>贝克特  调查结果出来了
<6-25,ESPOSITO>Hey, you, Beckett. Story checks.

384
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,450
<6-25,ESPOSITO>约翰·艾伦八个月前被解雇了
<6-25,ESPOSITO>John Allen was laid off eight months ago

385
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,950
<6-25,ESPOSITO>就在美国国际集团遭遇危机的时候
<6-25,ESPOSITO>When the A.I.G. crisis hit.

386
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,160
<6-26,BECKETT>爱伯克奇那边怎样
<6-26,BECKETT>What about Albuquerque?

387
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,300
<6-27,RYAN>没有约翰·艾伦
<6-27,RYAN>No record of a John Allen

388
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,340
<6-27,RYAN>从附近三个州坐飞机的记录
<6-27,RYAN>Coming back from any flight in the tri-state area.

389
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,990
<6-28,CASTLE>这让人怀疑他还对妻子隐瞒了什么
<6-28,CASTLE>Well, it makes you wonder what else he lied to his wife about.

390
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,770
<6-29,BECKETT>还有他是怎么继续生活的  我是贝克特
<6-29,BECKETT>And how he paid all of his bills. Beckett.

391
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,330
<6-29,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<6-29,BECKETT>All right. Uh, thank you.

392
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,650
<6-29,BECKETT>再一次  发现尸体
<6-29,BECKETT>They found his body...again.

393
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,440
<7-1,BECKETT>什么情况
<7-1,BECKETT>What happened?

394
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,180
<7-2,LANIE>有人解剖了他
<7-2,LANIE>Someone...operated on him.

395
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,010
<7-3,BECKETT>解剖
<7-3,BECKETT>Operated?

396
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,620
<7-4,LANIE>有人剖开他的腹部  拿走他的所有器官
<7-4,LANIE>They cut him open and took all of his organs out.

397
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,940
<7-4,LANIE>有人讨厌他的内脏
<7-4,LANIE>Somebody hated his guts.

398
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,680
<7-4,LANIE>动手的人不是外科医生
<7-4,LANIE>The guys who did this weren't surgeons.

399
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,220
<8-1,LANIE>切口不争气  用的是美工刀和厨房刀具
<8-1,LANIE>The cuts are sloppy, box cutters and kitchen knives.

400
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,780
<8-2,BECKETT>能推测出他们在找什么吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Any idea what they were looking for?

401
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,470
<8-2,BECKETT>毒理测试显示血管里没有毒素
<8-2,BECKETT>I ran a tox screen and found nothing in the bloodstream,

402
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,830
<8-3,LANIE>但体腔里验出
<8-3,LANIE>But in the body cavity itself,

403
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,590
<8-3,LANIE>微量粉状可卡因
<8-3,LANIE>There were trace amounts of powder cocaine.

404
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,930
<8-4,BECKETT>他在帮着偷运毒品
<8-4,BECKETT>He was their drug mule.

405
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,710
<8-5,LANIE>猜想毒贩等不及他用老办法运毒了
<8-5,LANIE>Guess they couldn't wait for him to pass the packets the old-fashioned way.

406
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,990
<8-6,CASTLE>我不同意
<8-6,CASTLE>I don't buy it.

407
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,720
<8-6,CASTLE>一个人到中年
<8-6,CASTLE>How does a middle-aged insurance actuary

408
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,880
<8-6,CASTLE>无吸毒记录
<8-6,CASTLE>With no history of substance abuse,

409
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,290
<8-6,CASTLE>无犯罪记录的保险精算师怎么会偷运毒品
<8-6,CASTLE>No criminal record, become a drug mule?

410
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,100
<8-6,CASTLE>而且他也不像坏人
<8-6,CASTLE>And this was not a bad guy.

411
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,160
<8-6,CASTLE>这不是在克雷格列表网[分类广告网站]
<8-6,CASTLE>You don't just fill out an ad

412
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,010
<8-6,CASTLE>填张广告
<8-6,CASTLE>On craigslist.

413
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,480
<8-6,CASTLE>你需要了解人  尤其是坏人
<8-6,CASTLE>You gotta--you gotta know people, bad people.

414
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,250
<8-7,LANIE>最古怪的是
<8-7,LANIE>As freaky as all this is,

415
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,130
<8-7,LANIE>不要忘了  解剖发生在死亡后
<8-7,LANIE>Let's not forget it happened postmortem.

416
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,950
<8-7,LANIE>直接死因在这里
<8-7,LANIE>The actual cause of death is up here.

417
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,040
<8-7,LANIE>淤痕说明凶手是用双手掐死他的
<8-7,LANIE>Bruise pattern indicates the assailant strangled him with both hands.

418
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,400
<8-8,CASTLE>这里的瘀伤较轻
<8-8,CASTLE>The bruising is a little lighter right there.

419
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,710
<8-9,BECKETT>说明什么
<8-9,BECKETT>What would account for that?

420
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,840
<8-10,LANIE>可能是手指脱臼或者断指
<8-10,LANIE>Dislocated or broken finger maybe.

421
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,380
<8-11,CASTLE>也可能是他精心设计的
<8-11,CASTLE>Maybe he's fancy.

422
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,400
<8-11,CASTLE>掐死人的时候翘起小指
<8-11,CASTLE>Strangled people with his pinkie sticking out.

423
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,960
<8-11,CASTLE>就像喝茶一样
<8-11,CASTLE>Like tea.

424
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,440
<8-12,ESPOSITO>我刚从国土安全局回来
<8-12,ESPOSITO>I just got off with homeland security.

425
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,830
<8-12,ESPOSITO>出境记录显示约翰·艾伦
<8-12,ESPOSITO>Passport records indicate that John Allen

426
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,090
<8-12,ESPOSITO>是从墨西哥回国  不是新墨西哥州
<8-12,ESPOSITO>Was coming back from Mexico, not new Mexico.

427
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,510
<8-13,BECKETT>没有犯罪记录  身体健康的白人中产阶级
<8-13,BECKETT>No criminal history, healthy, white, middle-class--

428
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,750
<8-13,BECKETT>海关人员都不会看他第二眼
<8-13,BECKETT>They wouldn't have looked at him twice at customs.

429
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,540
<8-14,ESPOSITO>这家伙很有本事  怎么去做这种蠢事
<8-14,ESPOSITO>The guy had skills. Why would he do something so stupid?

430
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,260
<8-15,RYAN>因为他必须这么做
<8-15,RYAN>Because he had to.

431
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,240
<8-15,RYAN>我刚刚和他妻子核实了经济情况
<8-15,RYAN>I just went over financials with the wife.

432
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,780
<8-16,BECKETT>有多糟
<8-16,BECKETT>How bad?

433
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,260
<8-17,RYAN>过去半年  他们一直靠信用卡过活
<8-17,RYAN>They've been living on credit cards the last six months.

434
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,020
<8-17,RYAN>他妻子被蒙在鼓里  还以为一切正常
<8-17,RYAN>She had no idea. She thought everything was fine.

435
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,310
<8-18,BECKETT>如果他每天不工作的话
<8-18,BECKETT>Well, if he wasn't going to work every day,

436
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,180
<8-18,BECKETT>-他会去哪里  -找工作
<8-18,BECKETT>- Where was he going? - He was applying for jobs.

437
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,550
<8-19,RYAN>我在他电脑里找到几百张求职信和简历
<8-19,RYAN>I found hundreds of cover letters and resume on his computer.

438
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,300
<8-20,BECKETT>搞不懂  他们为什么不卖掉公寓
<8-20,BECKETT>I don't understand. Why didn't they just sell the apartment?

439
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,710
<8-21,RYAN>-还收不回首付和按揭  -真是太惨了
<8-21,RYAN>- Wasn't worth the mortgage. - Man, that's harsh.

440
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,940
<8-23,CASTLE>人寿保险呢
<8-23,CASTLE>Life insurance?

441
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,690
<8-24,RYAN>四个月前就停止投保了
<8-24,RYAN>Mm. Stopped making payments four months ago.

442
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,950
<8-24,RYAN>这家伙已经没希望了  无论是生海是死
<8-24,RYAN>Guy was basically worthless, alive or dead.

443
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,490
<8-24,RYAN>是的  我是瑞恩
<8-24,RYAN>Yeah, Ryan here.

444
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,410
<8-25,CASTLE>我理解他的绝望
<8-25,CASTLE>You know, I get desperation,

445
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,940
<8-25,CASTLE>也能理解他急需钱去运毒
<8-25,CASTLE>I get needing the money, I even get being a drug mule.

446
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,630
<8-25,CASTLE>我不懂的是  他怎么找到这份差事的
<8-25,CASTLE>What I don't get is, where did he get the job?

447
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,780
<8-26,RYAN>好的  谢谢  比尔
<8-26,RYAN>Yeah, thanks, bill.

448
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,130
<8-26,RYAN>犯罪现场小组刚才来电话
<8-26,RYAN>That was C.S.U.

449
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,880
<8-26,RYAN>由于罪犯戴手套作案
<8-26,RYAN>Because our perps were wearing gloves,

450
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,840
<8-26,RYAN>车上发现的指纹属于车主
<8-26,RYAN>The only prints they could grab off the car belong to the owner,

451
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,650
<8-26,RYAN>而他昨晚报案自己的车被偷
<8-26,RYAN>Who reported it stolen last night.

452
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,650
<8-26,RYAN>看来我们没在这找到突破口
<8-26,RYAN>Looks like we're not gonna grab a break on this one.

453
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,320
<8-27,BECKETT>在现场发现的那个手套呢
<8-27,BECKETT>What about the glove we found at the scene?

454
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,320
<8-28,ESPOSITO>也被清理过了  什么都没有
<8-28,ESPOSITO>Dusted it, too. Nothing.

455
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,610
<8-29,BECKETT>-里面也查过了吗  -里面
<8-29,BECKETT>- Did you dust inside?  - Inside?

456
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,180
<8-29,BECKETT>对  手套内层
<8-29,BECKETT>Yeah, inside the glove.

457
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,820
<9-1,CASTLE>要来点音乐吗
<9-1,CASTLE>You want me to put on some music?

458
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,380
<9-1,CASTLE>《犯罪现场调查》里他们干活的时候
<9-1,CASTLE>Whenever they do this sort of thing on "CSI,"

459
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,950
<9-1,CASTLE>总是会在昏暗的小屋里放点音乐
<9-1,CASTLE>They always do it to music in poorly lit rooms.

460
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,150
<9-1,CASTLE>有点让我想起黄片
<9-1,CASTLE>Kinda reminds me of porn.

461
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,660
<9-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  闭嘴
<9-2,BECKETT>Zip it, Castle.

462
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,570
<9-3,CASTLE>没想过当个模特么
<9-3,CASTLE>Ever consider becoming a model?

463
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,460
<9-4,LANIE>继续说话  就让你试试这个
<9-4,LANIE>Keep talking, and I'll practice on you.

464
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,580
<9-5,BECKETT>抓到你了  王八蛋
<9-5,BECKETT>Got you, you son of a bitch.

465
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,150
<9-5,BECKETT>不错  记录在案
<9-5,BECKETT>Boom. Got a hit.

466
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,530
<9-5,BECKETT>路德·怀特黑德
<9-5,BECKETT>Luther Whitehead.

<10-1,ESPOSITO>现正假释中
<10-1,ESPOSITO>And is currently on parole for conspiracy to distribute.

471
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,000
<10-2,BECKETT>看来他的假释要被取消了
<10-2,BECKETT>Something tells me his parole's about to be revoked.

472
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,010
<10-2,BECKETT>有地址没

474
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,050
<10-3,ESPOSITO>举起手来  不准动
<10-3,ESPOSITO>Hold it right there! Nobody move!

<10-4,BECKETT>律师先生  我肯定他们非法持有枪支
<10-4,BECKETT>Counselor, I have them dead to rights on weapons

<10-4,BECKETT>袭击警方  亵渎尸体

479
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
<10-4,BECKETT>我还没时间去想
<10-4,BECKETT>I haven't even begun to think about yet.

480
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,670
<10-4,BECKETT>我有什么理由同意呢
<10-4,BECKETT>What is my incentive to cut a deal?

481
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,500
<10-5,LAWYER>-他们没有参与谋杀  -给我点时间
<10-5,LAWYER>- You don't have them on the murder.  - Give me time.

482

<10-41,RON BIGBY>是他走投无路来找我

543
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,960
<10-41,RON BIGBY>他记起我某晚在桌上跟他说的故事
<10-41,RON BIGBY>He--he remembered a story I told one night at the table.

544
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,960

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,870
<10-43,RON BIGBY>对  牌桌

546
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,660
<10-43,RON BIGBY>我们在市里参与流动游戏
<10-43,RON BIGBY>We're in one of the floating games around town.

<10-43,RON BIGBY>小赌怡情  又排解压力
<10-43,RON BIGBY>You know, small stakes, right? But good way to blow off steam.

548
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,150
<10-43,RON BIGBY>但当他失业以后  就不再是个游戏了
<10-43,RON BIGBY>But then when he got laid off, it stopped being a game.

549
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,320
<10-43,RON BIGBY>他开始靠赌博来挣取他的生活费
<10-43,RON BIGBY>He started betting to make up his paycheck,

550
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,690
<10-43,RON BIGBY>但是赌注太小了
<10-43,RON BIGBY>But the stakes were too low.

551
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,990
<10-43,RON BIGBY>所以他去了唐人街
<10-43,RON BIGBY>So he went to chinatown.

552
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,840
<10-44,CASTLE>地下赌庄

554
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,200
<10-45,RON BIGBY>但是  运气是个变幻无常狗东西
<10-45,RON BIGBY>But...luck's a fickle bitch.

555
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,940
<10-45,RON BIGBY>他输掉的次数比赢得次数多
<10-45,RON BIGBY>He lost more than he had to the wrong guy.

556
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,990
<10-46,BECKETT>他输掉的太多
<10-46,BECKETT>He couldn't make enough to cover his losses.

557
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,990
<10-47,RON BIGBY>对  那时他想起我跟他说的故事
<10-47,RON BIGBY>Yeah, that's when he remembered the night I told the story

558
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,580
<10-47,RON BIGBY>跟我个人的财务危机有关
<10-47,RON BIGBY>About my own fiscal emergency,

561
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,660
<10-47,RON BIGBY>那时候我才想到  有什么关系
<10-47,RON BIGBY>That's when I figured, hey, what the hell?

562
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,460
<10-48,BECKETT>-先付钱就是了  -他的债主
<10-48,BECKETT>- Just pay it forward. - All right, this guy that he owed--

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,840
<10-48,BECKETT>他有给你说过长相或是提到名字吗
<10-48,BECKETT>Did he give you a description, name?

<10-49,RON BIGBY>他的纹身布满全身
<10-49,RON BIGBY>Because of all his tattoos.

567

<10-50,RYAN>如果一个俄国纹身暴徒紧追不舍
<10-50,RYAN>If some tatted-up Russian mobster was after me,

00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,750
<21-6,CASTLE>他喜欢打牌
<21-6,CASTLE>With a taste for cards.

697
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,200
<21-6,CASTLE>他不顾一切掠人钱财
<21-6,CASTLE>He, uh, preys Off of desperation,

698
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,220
<21-6,CASTLE>引诱别人不顾财力加大赌注
<21-6,CASTLE>Luring people in to bet him more than they have.

699
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,390
<21-7,BLUE SHIRT GUY>他为什么这么做
<21-7,BLUE SHIRT GUY>And why would he do this?

700
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,400
<21-8,CASTLE>因为他还放高利贷
<21-8,CASTLE>Because he's also A loan shark.

701
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,120
<21-8,CASTLE>他找到受害者  拿到利息
<21-8,CASTLE>See, he fronts his victims, and makes bank on...

702
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,890
<22-1,BECKETT>他究竟在干什么
<22-1,BECKETT>What the hell is he doing?

703
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,340
<22-2,ESPOSITO>他在打牌  引诱其中一个人
<22-2,ESPOSITO>He's playing poker. He's trying to provoke

704
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,830
<22-2,ESPOSITO>放弃手里的牌
<22-2,ESPOSITO>One of these guys Into giving up their hand.

705
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,270
<22-3,BECKETT>-或是要套出凶手  -但有个人
<22-3,BECKETT>- Or he's trying to tip off our killer. - But there's one guy,

706
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,300
<22-3,BECKETT>一个有家的人  他陷得有点深了
<22-3,BECKETT>A family guy, he gets in A little too deep,

707
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,930
<23-1,CASTLE>无法还清债务
<23-1,CASTLE>Can't pay the loan back.

708
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,550
<23-1,CASTLE>所以那歹徒没有选择了
<23-1,CASTLE>So the mobster...got no choice.

709
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,130
<23-1,CASTLE>不得不杀了他
<23-1,CASTLE>Has to kill him,

710
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,680
<23-1,CASTLE>把消息传给债务人的雇主
<23-1,CASTLE>Send a message to anyone else who owes him.

711
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,570
<23-1,CASTLE>一晚  他把他引到一间废弃的大楼
<23-1,CASTLE>So one night... He lures him into an abandoned building,

712
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,400
<23-1,CASTLE>掐死他  然后把他从屋顶扔下去
<23-1,CASTLE>Strangles him to death and throws him off the roof.

713
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,560
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>听起来写得很费力
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>Sounds like lot of work.

714
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,010
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>为什么不直接朝他头上打一枪
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>Why not just put bullet in his head?

715
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,970
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>容易多了
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>It's much more simple.

716
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,580
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>莱恩  仔细看看
<23-2,BLUE SHIRT GUY>Hey, Ryan, Check this out.

717
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,260
<24-1,ESPOSITO>他用手指在干什么
<24-1,ESPOSITO>What is he doing with his finger?

718
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,400
<24-2,BECKETT>放大  那是个假体
<24-2,BECKETT>Punch in on that. It's a prosthetic.

719
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,430
<24-2,BECKETT>所以死者脖子上的伤痕会是那样
<24-2,BECKETT>That's why it didn't leave A mark on our

720
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,130
<24-2,BECKETT>那就是凶手
<24-2,BECKETT>That's our guy.

721
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,540
<24-3,ESPOSITO>如果他认为卡塞尔对他有威胁  他会
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Hey, if he thinks Castle's a threat, he's--

722
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,960
<24-4,BECKETT>我们得马上把他带走
<24-4,BECKETT>We gotta get him outta there, now.

723
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,620
<24-5,ESPOSITO>他们的保安武装得很好
<24-5,ESPOSITO>Their security's pretty well armed.

724
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,610
<24-5,ESPOSITO>我们以警察身份进去的话  会引起骚动的
<24-5,ESPOSITO>We go in there as cops, it might get messy.

725
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,430
<24-6,RYAN>你要干什么
<24-6,RYAN>Oh, what are you doing?

727
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,580

<24-8,ESPOSITO>What are you gonna do, lip gloss 'em to death?

730
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,980
<24-9,BECKETT>八九不离十
<24-9,BECKETT>Something like that.

731
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,250
<24-10,SECURITY GUARDS>别这样嘛  伙什们
<24-10,SECURITY GUARDS>Oh, come on, boys.

732
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,580
<24-11,BECKETT>我男朋友在里面玩牌  他还等着我
<24-11,BECKETT>My boyfriend is waiting. He is player.

733
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
<24-11,BECKETT>我不进去助阵  他会输钱的
<24-11,BECKETT>If I don't go inside, he will lose.

734
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,820
<24-11,BECKETT>我可是他的幸运女神
<24-11,BECKETT>I'm his lucky charm, you know?

<24-11,BECKETT>We win, and when I am in there, we always win,

738
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,670
<24-11,BECKETT>走运的话  你或许也能分点甜头
<24-11,BECKETT>And then maybe I can share some of my boyfriend's luck with you.

739
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,890
<25-2,CASTLE>全押
<25-2,CASTLE>All in.

740
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,190
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>作家先生  数目不小啊
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>It's a big pot, Mr. Writer man...

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,900
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>钱全在这里了
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>All that money.

742
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,350
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>不过这点钱对于百万富翁来说算得了什么
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>But then, what is money to millionaire, huh?

743
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,060
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>只要少缴点税就行
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>You just can write it off on your taxes

744
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,400
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>耍点小手段
<25-1,BLUE SHIRT GUY>Uh, as, uh, doing research.

745
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,150
<25-2,CASTLE>全跟
<25-2,CASTLE>All in.

746
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,290
<25-3,BLUE SHIRT GUY>你有点像自己小说里的人物
<25-3,BLUE SHIRT GUY>You are like character in your book...

747
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,850
<25-3,BLUE SHIRT GUY>陷得太深
<25-3,BLUE SHIRT GUY>In too deep.

748
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,070
<25-3,BLUE SHIRT GUY>三张Q
<25-3,BLUE SHIRT GUY>Three queens.

749
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,530
<25-4,CASTLE>手气很冲
<25-4,CASTLE>That's very impressive.

750
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,910
<25-4,CASTLE>赢的机会很大
<25-4,CASTLE>Not a lot can beat three queens.

751
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,030
<25-4,CASTLE>可惜难敌五张顺子
<25-4,CASTLE>Except an inside straight, maybe.

752
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,770
<25-4,CASTLE>宝贝  专为你准备的
<25-4,CASTLE>Sweetheart, this is for you.

753
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,410
<25-4,CASTLE>能不能把这些换一换  以方便携带
<25-4,CASTLE>Would you change this into something a little smaller that I can carry?

754
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,600
<25-4,CASTLE>这数目可不小
<25-4,CASTLE>Now that is a big pile of money.

755
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,040
<25-4,CASTLE>不过这点钱对于强盗来说算得了什么
<25-4,CASTLE>But what's money to a mobster, right?

756
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,730
<25-5,GUY IN WHITE>别停下
<25-5,GUY IN WHITE>Walk.

757
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,050
<25-8,CASTLE>-你到底干什么的  -不是说了  我是作家
<25-8,CASTLE>- Who are you? - I told you, I'm, I’m a novelist.

758
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,060
<25-9,GUY IN WHITE>你听谁说的那个死人  房顶的故事
<25-9,GUY IN WHITE>The story--the dead man, the roof, who told you?

759
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,880
<25-10,CASTLE>-听谁说的  -他家人和孩子
<25-10,CASTLE>- Who knows? - His family knows, His children know.

760
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,940
<25-11,GUY IN WHITE>要是他还了钱  早可以回家老婆孩子团聚了
<25-11,GUY IN WHITE>If he paid what he owed, He'd be home with them now.

761
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,920
<25-11,GUY IN WHITE>可他却找死  现在你也想找死
<25-11,GUY IN WHITE>But he crossed me. And now you have crossed me.

762
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,160
<25-12,CASTLE>我不想死  我就是个写书的
<25-12,CASTLE>No, no, no, I'm just a writer.

763
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,420
<25-13,GUY IN WHITE>-别蒙我  你是警察  -他能是警察
<25-13,GUY IN WHITE>- Do not lie. You're a cop. - Him, a cop?

764
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,040
<25-14,BECKETT>别逗了  他当男人都不够格
<25-14,BECKETT>Don't make me laugh. He's barely even a man.

765
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,720
<25-15,CASTLE>贝克特
<25-15,CASTLE>Beckett?

766
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,810
<25-16,BECKETT>不过你算个纯爷们  长得也挺帅
<25-16,BECKETT>But you are a man, aren't you? A very handsome man.

767
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,460
<25-16,BECKETT>理查德  你怎么惹帅哥生气啦
<25-16,BECKETT>Richard, are you bothering this handsome man?

768
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,580
<25-17,GUY IN WHITE>滚开
<25-17,GUY IN WHITE>Go away.

769
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,740
<25-18,BECKETT>好吧  玩枪的小子
<25-18,BECKETT>Okay, boys and their guns.

770
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,290
<25-18,BECKETT>我以为自己还有点姿色
<25-18,BECKETT>Am I supposed to be impressed?

771
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,590
<25-19,GUY IN WHITE>这事与你无关
<25-19,GUY IN WHITE>It doesn't concern you.

772
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,210
<25-20,BECKETT>其实是
<25-20,BECKETT>Actually...

773
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,490
<25-20,BECKETT>有关系
<25-20,BECKETT>It does.

774
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,730
<25-21,CASTLE>这是我的幻觉  还是你真变了
<25-21,CASTLE>Is it Just my imagination, or did you change?

775
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,930
<25-22,BECKETT>卡塞尔  请叫支援好吗
<25-22,BECKETT>Castle, could you get some backup, please?

776
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,830
<25-22,BECKETT>-好的  -别出声  多谢合作
<25-22,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Shah, shh, shh. Quiet. Thank you.

777
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,790
<25-22,BECKETT>这边请
<25-22,BECKETT>This way.

778
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,240
<26-1,CASTLE>她怎么样
<26-1,CASTLE>So how is she?

779
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,380
<26-2,BECKETT>原本以为的一切竟然都是谎言
<26-2,BECKETT>It's hard when everything you thought you knew

780
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,970
<26-2,BECKETT>所以很难过
<26-2,BECKETT>Turns out to be a lie.

781
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,950
<26-3,CASTLE>并非全是谎言
<26-3,CASTLE>Well, not everything was a lie.

782
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,450
<26-3,CASTLE>起码她丈夫的爱是真的
<26-3,CASTLE>Not her husband's love.

783
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,210
<26-3,CASTLE>虽然有时候做错事  但出发点是好的
<26-3,CASTLE>I mean, sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons.

784
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,760
<26-4,BECKETT>结案了  你的《时尚》专访也能圆满结局了
<26-4,BECKETT>So case is closed. I guess your "Cosmo" story gets a happy ending.

785
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,490
<26-5,CASTLE>说到圆满结局
<26-5,CASTLE>Speaking of happy endings...

786
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,540
<26-5,CASTLE>还要谢谢你救我一命
<26-5,CASTLE>Thanks for saving my life.

787
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,690
<26-6,BECKETT>我不过是懒得写报告而已
<26-6,BECKETT>I was just trying to avoid paperwork.

788
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,710
<26-7,CASTLE>我们确实是最佳拍档
<26-7,CASTLE>Ah. We make a pretty good team, you know?

789
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,090
<26-7,CASTLE>就像《警界双雄》
<26-7,CASTLE>Like Starsky and Hutch,

790
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,450
<26-7,CASTLE>《坦戈与卡什》
<26-7,CASTLE>Tango and Cash,

791
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,370
<26-7,CASTLE>《福星和福将》
<26-7,CASTLE>Turner and Hooch.

792
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,690
<26-8,BECKETT>说起这部片子
<26-8,BECKETT>You know, Now that you mention it,

793
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,730
<26-8,BECKETT>你倒是很像福将  那只狗呢
<26-8,BECKETT>You do remind me a little of hooch.

794
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,700
<26-9,CASTLE>我猜你害怕了
<26-9,CASTLE>It's because you're afraid, isn't it?

795
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,690
<26-9,CASTLE>你不想让我追查你母亲的死因
<26-9,CASTLE>You're afraid that if you look in to your mother's death,

796
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,080
<26-9,CASTLE>你不愿再旧事重提  怕再次迷失自我
<26-9,CASTLE>That you will go back down that rabbit hole and lose yourself again.

797
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,660
<26-9,CASTLE>不过  今非昔比
<26-9,CASTLE>But it's different this time.

798
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,740
<26-9,CASTLE>我们有上乘的线索
<26-9,CASTLE>We have good leads.

799
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,980
<26-9,CASTLE>重要线索
<26-9,CASTLE>We have strong leads.

800
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,770
<26-9,CASTLE>这次你不用再孤军奋战
<26-9,CASTLE>And you won't have to do it alone.

801
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,690
<26-9,CASTLE>我来帮你
<26-9,CASTLE>We can do it together.

802
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,100
<26-9,CASTLE>要是我根本没想查呢
<26-9,CASTLE>What if I don't want to know?

803
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,370
<26-10,BECKETT>你有没有想过我是否想查
<26-10,BECKETT>Did you ever think of that?

804
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,270
<26-10,BECKETT>我没做好心理准备呢
<26-10,BECKETT>What if I'm not ready?

805
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,050
<26-10,BECKETT>要是抓到杀害我母亲的凶手
<26-10,BECKETT>What if the idea of catching my mom's murderer

806
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,080
<26-10,BECKETT>眼睁睁看着他却与警方达成交易
<26-10,BECKETT>And then having to sit there and watch as he cuts some deal

807
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,140
<26-10,BECKETT>坐十年牢后又自由了
<26-10,BECKETT>That puts him back out on the street in ten years

808
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,780
<26-10,BECKETT>让我很不爽怎么办
<26-10,BECKETT>Makes me nauseous?

809
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,800
<26-10,BECKETT>你挖我的老底不是为我好  而是为你自己
<26-10,BECKETT>You dredged up my past for you, castle, not for me.

810
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,120
<26-10,BECKETT>你太过自私  甚至都没注意到这点
<26-10,BECKETT>And you're too selfish to even see it.

811
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,110
<26-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这案子结了
<26-10,BECKETT>The case is closed, Castle.

812
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,840
<26-10,BECKETT>我们以前说好了  希望你能信守承诺
<26-10,BECKETT>We made a deal, and I expect you to honor it.

<27-1,ALEXIS>创作呢
<27-1,ALEXIS>You're writing.

<27-2,CASTLE>该写了
<27-2,CASTLE>It's time.

815
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,420
<27-3,ALEXIS>贝克特呢
<27-3,ALEXIS>And Beckett?

816
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,600
<27-3,ALEXIS>很抱歉  爸爸
<27-3,ALEXIS>I'm sorry, dad.

817
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,160
<27-4,CASTLE>电影看得好吗
<27-4,CASTLE>So how was the movie?

818
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,410
<27-5,ALEXIS>没去
<27-5,ALEXIS>We didn't go.

819
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,230
<27-6,CASTLE>-怎么没去  -欧文
<27-6,CASTLE>- Why not? - Owen.

820
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,850
<27-8,CASTLE>怎么了
<27-8,CASTLE>What happened?

821
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,170
<27-9,ALEXIS>他游戏玩昏了头  错过了时间
<27-9,ALEXIS>He was playing video games and lost track of time.

822
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,670
<27-9,ALEXIS>他来得太晚
<27-9,ALEXIS>By the time he showed up, it was too late.

823
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,380
<27-10,CASTLE>很抱歉  宝贝
<27-10,CASTLE>sorry, sweetie.

824
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,400
<27-11,ALEXIS>他不光来晚了  还装出一副满不在乎的样子
<27-11,ALEXIS>And then when he did show up, He tried to act like It's no big deal,

825
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,350
<27-11,ALEXIS>弄得好像是我紧张过度
<27-11,ALEXIS>Like I'm overreacting.

826
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,570
<27-11,ALEXIS>甚至连通电话都没打
<27-11,ALEXIS>I mean, he didn't even call.

827
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,960
<27-11,ALEXIS>男生怎么都这样
<27-11,ALEXIS>Why do boys do that?

828
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,720
<27-11,ALEXIS>怎么能事事都狡辩
<27-11,ALEXIS>Why do they always have to justify everything?

829
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,780
<27-11,ALEXIS>说句对不起就这么难吗
<27-11,ALEXIS>Why can't they just say they're sorry?

830
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,170
<27-12,CASTLE>谢谢
<27-12,CASTLE>Thank you.

831
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,140
<27-13,ALEXIS>谢什么
<27-13,ALEXIS>For what?

<28-1,CASTLE>What I did was wrong.

835
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,770
<28-1,CASTLE>辜负了你的信任  揭你的旧伤疤
<28-1,CASTLE>I violated your trust, I opened old wounds,

836
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,000
<28-1,CASTLE>违背你的意愿
<28-1,CASTLE>And I did not respect your wishes.

837
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,060
<28-1,CASTLE>也许我们以后没机会再见了
<28-1,CASTLE>And if we're not gonna see each oath again,

838
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,090
<28-1,CASTLE>我要对你说一声
<28-1,CASTLE>Then you deserve to know...
