10
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,300
<2-1,MALE OFFICER>所有工人  请离开建筑工地
<2-1,MALE OFFICER>All workers, please clear the construction site.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
<2-2,ESPOSITO>他们就不能在上班时间发现尸体吗
<2-2,ESPOSITO>Why can't they find bodies between 9:00 and 5:00?

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,200
<2-3,BECKETT>早起的鸟儿才有虫吃
<2-3,BECKETT>Well, early bird gets the collar.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
<2-5,ESPOSITO>他来的比我还早
<2-5,ESPOSITO>He was here before I was.

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,000
<2-6,CASTLE>你终于来了  你一定会喜欢这个
<2-6,CASTLE>Oh! Finally, you are here. You are gonna love this.

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,700
<2-7,RYAN>表演结束了
<2-7,RYAN>Come on, show's over!

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,100
<2-7,RYAN>正在进行犯罪现场调查  谢谢合作
<2-7,RYAN>Active crime scene. We appreciate your cooperation.

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,700
<2-8,CASTLE>很可怕吧  我的第一件悬案
<2-8,CASTLE>Awesome, right? My first cold case.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
<2-8,CASTLE>别这样  这案子挺有趣的
<2-8,CASTLE>Come on, it's a little funny.

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,400
<2-9,LANIE>没什么有趣的  她被冻成冰块了
<2-9,LANIE>Not so much funny as true. She's frozen solid.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,900
<2-10,BECKETT>昨天夜里气温是多少
<2-10,BECKETT>What was the temperature last night?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,100
<2-11,RYAN>摄氏7度
<2-11,RYAN>Mid-40s.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,700
<2-12,LANIE>不是因为暴尸在外才冻成这样的
<2-12,LANIE>It wasn't exposure.

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
<2-13,ESPOSITO>案发现场一直有人
<2-13,ESPOSITO>Site's active.

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,800
<2-13,ESPOSITO>这儿的人说  昨晚她肯定没在这儿
<2-13,ESPOSITO>The boys tell me there's no way she was here last night.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,600
<2-14,BECKETT>她正在融化
<2-14,BECKETT>She's melting.

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
<2-15,CASTLE>该找找红宝石鞋(源自绿野仙踪)
<2-15,CASTLE>Maybe we should be looking

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
<2-15,CASTLE>(轻敲鞋跟就能回家)
<2-15,CASTLE>For ruby slippers.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,590
<2-16,BECKETT>是啊  你找的时候
<2-16,BECKETT>Yeah, while you're at it,

29
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,880
<2-16,BECKETT>顺便再找找会飞的猴子
<2-16,BECKETT>Why don't you look for some flying monkeys?

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,900
<2-16,BECKETT>也许是它们把她摆在那的
<2-16,BECKETT>Maybe they left her here.

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,400
<2-16,BECKETT>有什么发现吗
<2-16,BECKETT>So what do you got for me?

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,950
<2-17,LANIE>尸体上找到了
<2-17,LANIE>There are pieces of plastic on her body

33
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,400
<2-17,LANIE>西装袋的塑料膜
<2-17,LANIE>From the garment bag.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
<2-18,BECKETT>所以她曾被装在西装袋内
<2-18,BECKETT>So she was inside the bag?

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,300
<2-19,LANIE>除此之外  她还需要点时间才能完全融化
<2-19,LANIE>Other than that, it's gonna take a while for her to thaw.

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
<2-19,LANIE>我能肯定  她被搬到这里的时间不长
<2-19,LANIE>I can tell you she hasn't been here long.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,100
<2-19,LANIE>也许只有几个小时
<2-19,LANIE>Maybe couple of hours.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
<2-20,BECKETT>这儿的安保措施怎么样
<2-20,BECKETT>What about security?

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,300
<2-21,ESPOSITO>钢丝网  有把钳子就能进来
<2-21,ESPOSITO>Chain-link. Pair of bolt cutters took care of that.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,070
<2-22,RYAN>看来凶手是想
<2-22,RYAN>Looks like our guy was hoping

41
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,000
<2-22,RYAN>把她埋在混凝土里
<2-22,RYAN>She'd disappear into the concrete pour.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,900
<2-23,ESPOSITO>再多浇几英尺  她就会被埋了
<2-23,ESPOSITO>A few more feet, and she would've.

43
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,890
<2-24,CASTLE>有点奇怪
<2-24,CASTLE>It's kind of odd--

44
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,400
<2-24,CASTLE>要埋尸  为什么还费神把她冻上呢
<2-24,CASTLE>Taking the trouble to freeze a body and then dumping it?

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
<2-24,CASTLE>这表现出了两种想法
<2-24,CASTLE>We got two personality types working here.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,650
<2-24,CASTLE>凶手把尸体冻起来
<2-24,CASTLE>A killer who freezes a body is a keeper

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,800
<2-24,CASTLE>作为纪念品
<2-24,CASTLE>He wants a souvenir.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,100
<2-24,CASTLE>但是又弃尸在这儿
<2-24,CASTLE>But a guy who dumps a body?

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,600
<2-25,BECKETT>是不想再和这案子有关联
<2-25,BECKETT>Doesn't want to be reminded of the crime.

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,800
<2-25,BECKETT>好了  我去围墙外面看看
<2-25,BECKETT>All right, I’m gonna go check out the fence.

51
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,300
<2-27,BECKETT>拍张面部特写
<2-27,BECKETT>Get a close-up of her face.

52
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,500
<2-27,BECKETT>和失踪人口作比对
<2-27,BECKETT>I want to run her through missing persons.

53
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
<2-28,CASTLE>太棒了  就像探索频道播的那样
<2-28,CASTLE>Oh, cool, like on the discovery channel,

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,010
<2-28,CASTLE>你们会把照片
<2-28,CASTLE>Where you plug the photo into

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,000
<2-28,CASTLE>存入面部识别数据库
<2-28,CASTLE>Facial recognition databases?

56
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,800
<2-29,BECKETT>-是的  就像那样  -太棒了
<2-29,BECKETT>- Yeah, just like that. - Yes!

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,200
<3-1,BECKETT>欢迎光临本局官方
<3-1,BECKETT>Welcome to the department's official

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
<3-1,BECKETT>面部识别数据库
<3-1,BECKETT>Facial recognition database.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,600
<3-2,CASTLE>要手动查找
<3-2,CASTLE>By hand?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,600
<3-2,CASTLE>似乎倒退到有数字录像机之前
<3-2,CASTLE>That's like life before tivo.

61
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
<3-3,ESPOSITO>也许你在手机上
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Maybe you could download an app

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,900
<3-3,ESPOSITO>下载个程序  就可以
<3-3,ESPOSITO>On that phone of yours. You could just--

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,100
<3-4,CASTLE>失踪人口还真多
<3-4,CASTLE>There are a lot of missing people.

64
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,200
<3-5,BECKETT>我们总会有办法找到他们的
<3-5,BECKETT>One way or another, we'll find them

65
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,400
<3-5,BECKETT>有的人死了
<3-5,BECKETT>Some end up dead,

66
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
<3-5,BECKETT>有的人出现在亚特兰大市郊的大房子
<3-5,BECKETT>Some turn up in a double-wide

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,100
<3-5,BECKETT>和年轻的白人脱衣舞女混在一起
<3-5,BECKETT>With a stripper named Trixie outside Atlantic city.

68
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,700
<3-6,ESPOSITO>还有的人  再也没出现过
<3-6,ESPOSITO>And some just don't turn up.

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
<3-7,CASTLE>达娜·苏利文
<3-7,CASTLE>Dana Sullivan.

70
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,600
<3-8,ESPOSITO>她和男朋友离开俱乐部的时候
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Mm-hmm. Her and her boyfriend leave a club.

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,050
<3-8,ESPOSITO>她男朋友接到个电话
<3-8,ESPOSITO>He's a couple steps behind her

72
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,400
<3-8,ESPOSITO>所以落在她后面几步
<3-8,ESPOSITO>'Cause he gets a call on his cell phone.

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,500
<3-8,ESPOSITO>她仅仅早几秒走过街角
<3-8,ESPOSITO>She turns a corner just a few seconds before he does.

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,100
<3-8,ESPOSITO>等他走过来的时候  她就不见了
<3-8,ESPOSITO>And when he comes around, she's gone.

75
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
<3-8,ESPOSITO>街道空空荡荡  没有车  什么都没有
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Street's totally empty-- no traffic, no nothing.

76
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,100
<3-8,ESPOSITO>相隔不到一米  她就这么消失了
<3-8,ESPOSITO>In a matter of 3 feet, she literally just disappeared.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
<3-9,CASTLE>人不会从地球表面消失的
<3-9,CASTLE>People don't disappear off the face of the earth.

78
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
<3-10,RYAN>当然会
<3-10,RYAN>Sure they do.

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,800
<3-10,RYAN>量子物理  外星人绑架  薛定谔的猫
<3-10,RYAN>Quantum physics, alien abductions, Schrodinger's cat.

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,900
<3-10,RYAN>前一分钟  你还在公园里买热狗
<3-10,RYAN>One minute, you're getting a hot dog in the park.

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,870
<3-10,RYAN>下一分钟  你就被带到空间裂隙中
<3-10,RYAN>The next, you're fighting off Sleestaks

82
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,100
<3-11,CASTLE>和爬行动物激战(《失落的大陆》剧情)
<3-11,CASTLE>On the far side of a dimensional rift.

83
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,300
<3-11,CASTLE>我不相信  肯定有个合理的解释
<3-11,CASTLE>I don't buy it. There's got to be an explanation

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,300
<3-11,CASTLE>一个让一切都合情合理的故事
<3-11,CASTLE>A story that makes everything make sense.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,300
<3-12,BECKETT>好吧  卡塞尔
<3-12,BECKETT>Okay, Castle,

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,100
<3-12,BECKETT>这具无名女尸的故事是什么呢
<3-12,BECKETT>What's our Jane Doe's story?

87
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,500
<3-13,CASTLE>虽然我不知道故事的起因
<3-13,CASTLE>Well, I don't know how it starts,

88
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,500
<3-13,CASTLE>但我知道结果  在建筑工地呈冰块状
<3-13,CASTLE>But I know how it ends-- frozen at a construction site.

89
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,300
<3-13,CASTLE>撇开会飞的猴子不谈  第一个疑点
<3-13,CASTLE>So flying monkeys aside, what's the first question?

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,700
<3-13,CASTLE>她是怎么到那里的
<3-13,CASTLE>How did she get there?

91
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,330
<3-14,RYAN>鉴于尸体的冻结程度
<3-14,RYAN>Considering she was frozen solid,

92
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,900
<3-14,RYAN>她应该被藏匿在工地附近
<3-14,RYAN>She had to have been kept pretty close.

93
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,700
<3-15,CASTLE>不一定
<3-15,CASTLE>Not necessarily.

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,650
<3-16,CASTLE>这儿是工地  但藏尸处
<3-16,CASTLE>Here is the site. Her body might not

95
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,500
<3-16,CASTLE>可能没你想的那么近
<3-16,CASTLE>Have been kept as close as you might think.

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
<3-16,CASTLE>冰冻的尸体融化需要很长时间
<3-16,CASTLE>It takes a long time for a frozen body to thaw.

97
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,300
<3-17,RYAN>怎么  为了写书  你也冻过尸体
<3-17,RYAN>What, you, uh, freeze a body once for one of your books?

98
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,800
<3-18,CASTLE>没有  但我在感恩节时做过火鸡
<3-18,CASTLE>No, but I cooked a turkey for thanksgiving.

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,800
<3-18,CASTLE>28磅重  一整晚才化开
<3-18,CASTLE>It was a 28-pounder. It took all night to unfreeze.

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
<3-19,BECKETT>她是个人  卡塞尔  不是火鸡
<3-19,BECKETT>She's a person, Castle, not a turkey.

101
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,600
<3-20,CASTLE>只是表明下看法
<3-20,CASTLE>Just making a point.

103
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
<3-21,BECKETT>好的  马上就来
<3-21,BECKETT>Okay. I'm on my way.

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
<3-22,BECKETT>蕾妮查到死者身份了
<3-22,BECKETT>Lanie’s got an I.D.

105
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,300
<3-23,CASTLE>这些留给你们处理
<3-23,CASTLE>You'll take care of these?

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,700
<3-24,ESPOSITO>莱恩  你能不能  谢了
<3-24,ESPOSITO>Hey, Ryan, can you, uh... Thanks.

107
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,700
<4-1,LANIE>梅勒妮·卡瓦诺  死亡年龄34岁
<4-1,LANIE>Melanie Kavanaugh, 34 at time of death.

108
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,000
<4-1,LANIE>死因是头部遭钝器重创
<4-1,LANIE>Turns out c.o.d. was blunt-force trauma to her head.

109
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,800
<4-2,BECKETT>怎么查到她的身份的
<4-2,BECKETT>How'd you get her I.D.?

110
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,400
<4-3,LANIE>系统里有她的指纹记录
<4-3,LANIE>Her fingerprints were in the system.

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
<4-5,LANIE>-为什么  -藏匿毒品的轻罪
<4-5,LANIE>- For? - Misdemeanor drug possession.

112
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,600
<4-6,CASTLE>她看起来不像是瘾君子啊
<4-6,CASTLE>She doesn't look like a junkie.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,200
<4-7,LANIE>是的  可以说  她身体状况良好
<4-7,LANIE>No, she's in pretty good shape, considering.

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,800
<4-7,LANIE>鉴于尸体没有起霜或组织变性
<4-7,LANIE>But judging the lack of frost and tissue degeneration,

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,150
<4-7,LANIE>因此藏尸地点
<4-7,LANIE>I'd say wherever she was stored,

116
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,500
<4-7,LANIE>温度变化不大
<4-7,LANIE>The temperature rarely varied.

117
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
<4-9,LANIE>-比如冷藏柜  -冷藏柜能达到这种效果
<4-9,LANIE>- Like a freezer. - Freezer'd do the job.

118
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,800
<4-10,BECKETT>她死了多久了
<4-10,BECKETT>How long has she been dead?

119
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,500
<4-10,BECKETT>考虑到她处于这种状态的时长
<4-10,BECKETT>Well, considering how long she's been like this,

120
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,400
<4-11,LANIE>还有尸体分解程度
<4-11,LANIE>Factoring decomposition,

121
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
<4-11,LANIE>她可能是在被杀后
<4-11,LANIE>I'd say she probably was frozen

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
<4-11,LANIE>24小时内被冻住
<4-11,LANIE>Within 24 hours of being killed.

123
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,700
<4-12,BECKETT>她处于这种状态的时长是指
<4-12,BECKETT>What do you mean, "how long she's been like this"?

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
<4-13,LANIE>根据我调出的报告
<4-13,LANIE>According to the records I pulled,

125
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,600
<4-13,LANIE>这女人已经失踪5年多了
<4-13,LANIE>This woman has been missing for over five years.

126
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,600
<4-13,LANIE>灵书妙探
<4-13,LANIE>第一季第五集

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
<5-1,BECKETT>她是个问题少女
<5-1,BECKETT>She had a troubled childhood.

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,100
<5-1,BECKETT>十几二十岁的时候吸毒
<5-1,BECKETT>Drug problems in her teens and 20s.

129
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
<5-2,CASTLE>我知道
<5-2,CASTLE>I know.

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
<5-3,BECKETT>你怎么知道
<5-3,BECKETT>How do you know?

131
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
<5-4,CASTLE>我看过案件档案  后来她戒掉了毒瘾
<5-4,CASTLE>I read the case file. She kicked the habit.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,300
<5-4,CASTLE>认识塞缪尔·卡瓦诺后结婚
<5-4,CASTLE>Met and married Samuel Kavanaugh.

133
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,570
<5-4,CASTLE>她在餐厅工作  而他是银行经理
<5-4,CASTLE>She worked in a restaurant. He managed a bank.

134
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,900
<5-4,CASTLE>他们有两个孩子
<5-4,CASTLE>They have two kids.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
<5-5,BECKETT>你什么时候看的档案
<5-5,BECKETT>When did you read the case file?

136
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,900
<5-7,CASTLE>你去厕所的时候
<5-7,CASTLE>When you were in the little girls' room.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,300
<5-8,BECKETT>我只去了  大概一分钟
<5-8,BECKETT>I was gone for, like, a minute.

138
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,300
<5-9,CASTLE>一目十行
<5-9,CASTLE>Speed-reader.

139
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
<5-9,CASTLE>我在纽约公共图书馆待这么多年的
<5-9,CASTLE>That's all I picked up from my years stranded

140
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,000
<5-9,CASTLE>唯一收获
<5-9,CASTLE>In the New York public library.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,350
<5-10,CASTLE>需要克利夫笔记  学习指南丛书吗
<5-10,CASTLE>Would you like the cliffsnotes?

142
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,500
<5-10,CASTLE>或者本案的卡塞尔笔记
<5-10,CASTLE>Or in this case, the Castle notes?

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,740
<5-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你怎么就敢肯定
<5-11,BECKETT>Castle, how do you know

144
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,900
<5-11,BECKETT>你没有忽略一些重点
<5-11,BECKETT>You didn't miss something important?

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,800
<5-12,CASTLE>比如梅勒妮失踪之后  她的丈夫等了一天
<5-12,CASTLE>Like, after Melanie disappeared, her husband waited a day

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
<5-12,CASTLE>-才打电话报警  -一天
<5-12,CASTLE>- Before he called the cops. - A day?

147
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,000
<5-13,BECKETT>这不合常理
<5-13,BECKETT>That doesn't make any sense.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
<5-14,CASTLE>看到第三段你就明白了
<5-14,CASTLE>Until you get to the third paragraph.

149
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,000
<5-14,CASTLE>在梅勒妮结婚之前
<5-14,CASTLE>Before Melanie was married,

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
<5-14,CASTLE>她上演过一次真实版落跑新娘
<5-14,CASTLE>She was what is now referred to as a "runaway bride."

151
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,400
<5-15,BECKETT>据她丈夫说
<5-15,BECKETT>According to her husband,

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,500
<5-15,BECKETT>在他们的婚礼前
<5-15,BECKETT>She ran away a whole two weeks

153
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,500
<5-15,BECKETT>她曾经离家整整2周
<5-15,BECKETT>Before their wedding day.

154
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,500
<5-16,CASTLE>然后她回来了
<5-16,CASTLE>Mm-hmm, and the she came back.

155
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
<5-16,CASTLE>他们渡过了三年的幸福时光
<5-16,CASTLE>Three years happily ever after,

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,500
<5-16,CASTLE>她再一次失踪  不久又回来了
<5-16,CASTLE>She disappears again and comes back.

157
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,800
<5-16,CASTLE>反反复复  一共三次
<5-16,CASTLE>Lather, rinse, repeat three times.

158
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,200
<5-16,CASTLE>行踪飘忽不定  难以追查
<5-16,CASTLE>No indication of where she went.

159
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,000
<5-17,BECKETT>离家出走  她一定有原因
<5-17,BECKETT>Well, she must've had a reason for running away.

160
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,400
<5-18,CASTLE>不一定  我不是对她有偏见
<5-18,CASTLE>Hmm. I'm not judging her.

161
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,400
<5-18,CASTLE>有些人喜欢刺激  讨厌日复一日的生活
<5-18,CASTLE>Some people love the institution, hate the day-to-day.

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
<5-19,BECKETT>你是其中之一吗  卡塞尔
<5-19,BECKETT>Are you one of those people, Castle?

163
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
<5-20,CASTLE>我想  我只是还没遇到真命天女
<5-20,CASTLE>I guess I just haven't met the right girl.

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
<5-21,CASTLE>所以她的丈夫没有报警是因为
<5-21,CASTLE>So that's why her husband didn't call the cops.

165
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
<5-21,CASTLE>她曾经离家出走过
<5-21,CASTLE>She'd done it before.

166
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,800
<5-21,CASTLE>当时负责此案的警官也认为合情合理
<5-21,CASTLE>Seemed reasonable to the detective at the time.

167
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,100
<5-22,BECKETT>没有任何证据证明是谋杀
<5-22,BECKETT>There's no evidence of foul play,

168
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,800
<5-22,BECKETT>所以就这么结案了
<5-22,BECKETT>So the detective just closed the case.

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,420
<5-22,BECKETT>已经五年了
<5-22,BECKETT>Five years,

170
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,400
<5-22,BECKETT>难道她丈夫还认为她只是离家出走
<5-22,BECKETT>And her husband thought she just ran away?

171
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
<5-23,CASTLE>我想  该是时候告诉他
<5-23,CASTLE>Guess it's time to tell him

172
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,900
<5-23,CASTLE>他的落跑新娘终于回来了
<5-23,CASTLE>His runaway bride finally came home.

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,500
<6-1,ROGER>是谁
<6-1,ROGER>Who is it?

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
<6-2,BECKETT>纽约市警察局
<6-2,BECKETT>New York city police department.

175
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,400
<6-3,ROGER>有什么事吗
<6-3,ROGER>Can I help you?

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,700
<6-4,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  你是塞缪尔·卡瓦诺吗
<6-4,BECKETT>Detective Beckett. Are you Samuel Kavanaugh?

177
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,100
<6-5,ROGER>谁
<6-5,ROGER>Who?

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,100
<6-6,BECKETT>塞缪尔·卡瓦诺  记录显示他住在这儿
<6-6,BECKETT>Samuel Kavanaugh. Our records indicate that he lives here.

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,700
<6-7,ROGER>不  你们一定是找错房间了
<6-7,ROGER>No, you must have the wrong apartment.

180
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,900
<6-8,BECKETT>9-1-7
<6-8,BECKETT>9-1-7?

181
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,900
<6-9,ROGER>是的  但我住在这
<6-9,ROGER>Yeah, but I live here,

182
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,600
<6-9,ROGER>而且我叫罗杰  不叫山姆
<6-9,ROGER>And my name is Roger. It's not Sam.

183
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,200
<6-10,BECKETT>那你认识塞缪尔·卡瓦诺吗
<6-10,BECKETT>Do you know any Samuel Kavanaugh?

184
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,000
<6-11,ROGER>不认识  怎么了
<6-11,ROGER>No. What's this about?

185
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,300
<6-12,CASTLE>你在这住了多久了
<6-12,CASTLE>How long have you lived here?

186
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
<6-13,ROGER>大概八个月
<6-13,ROGER>About eight months.

187
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,200
<6-14,CASTLE>已经过去五年了  他可能已经搬走了
<6-14,CASTLE>Well, it's been five years. He could've moved.

188
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,000
<6-15,ROGER>很抱歉打断你们
<6-15,ROGER>Well, yeah, I hate to break it to you,

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,300
<6-15,ROGER>如果你们是要找  之前住在这儿的人
<6-15,ROGER>But if you're looking for the guy who lived here before me,

190
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
<6-15,ROGER>他没搬走  他被谋杀了
<6-15,ROGER>He didn't move. He was murdered.

191
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
<6-16,CASTLE>等等
<6-16,CASTLE>Wait!

192
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,500
<7-1,RYAN>-贝克特  -什么事
<7-1,RYAN>- Hey, Beckett. - Yeah?

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
<7-2,BECKETT>塞缪尔·卡瓦诺
<7-2,BECKETT>Samuel Kavanaugh--

194
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,500
<7-3,ESPOSITO>大约一年前  他在一间杂货店外中枪
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Shot outside a grocery store about a year ago.

195
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,420
<7-3,ESPOSITO>小口径枪支  胸部中了两枪
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Small caliber, double tap to the chest.

196
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,300
<7-3,ESPOSITO>钱包和贵重物品被抢走
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Wallet and valuables missing.

197
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,700
<7-4,RYAN>可怜的倒霉蛋  老婆失踪了
<7-4,RYAN>Poor schlub's wife disappears

198
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,100
<7-4,RYAN>四年后  他又遇到劫案被杀
<7-4,RYAN>Four years later, he gets shot in a mugging.

199
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
<7-5,ESPOSITO>是啊  有什么值得奇怪的
<7-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, what are the odds?

200
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,800
<7-6,CASTLE>没有  除非这些之间是有关联的
<7-6,CASTLE>No, unless they're connected.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
<7-7,ESPOSITO>什么  相隔四年的两起谋杀案
<7-7,ESPOSITO>What, four years between the murders

202
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
<7-7,ESPOSITO>一个被冻成冰棍  一个被枪杀
<7-7,ESPOSITO>One's a popsicle, one just got popped.

203
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,900
<7-7,ESPOSITO>这之间怎么可能有联系
<7-7,ESPOSITO>How could they possibly be connected?

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
<7-8,CASTLE>也许他们夫妇二人陷入了
<7-8,CASTLE>Maybe he and his wife got into something

205
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,400
<7-8,CASTLE>无法摆脱的麻烦
<7-8,CASTLE>They couldn't get out of,

206
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,300
<7-8,CASTLE>也许和她曾经吸毒有关
<7-8,CASTLE>Maybe something to do with her drug habit.

207
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,100
<7-9,RYAN>你是说  某个瘾君子等了四年才杀了他
<7-9,RYAN>So some skell waits four years finished the job.

208
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,900
<7-10,CASTLE>也许是丈夫终于发现了妻子的事
<7-10,CASTLE>Maybe he finally figured out what happened to his wife

209
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,100
<7-10,CASTLE>正准备去警局报案
<7-10,CASTLE>And was about to go to the police with it.

210
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,200
<7-11,RYAN>我不相信
<7-11,RYAN>I don't believe it.

211
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,800
<7-12,CASTLE>我写250页小说给你看  保证你相信
<7-12,CASTLE>Give me 250 pages. I bet I could make you.

212
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,060
<7-13,BECKETT>我们正在处理一桩谋杀案  卡塞尔
<7-13,BECKETT>We're solving a murder, Castle,

213
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,300
<7-13,BECKETT>不是在写书
<7-13,BECKETT>Not writing a book.

214
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,000
<7-14,CASTLE>就叫做  嗜血冰封
<7-14,CASTLE>I would call it, "a chill runs through her veins."

215
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,800
<7-15,ESPOSITO>我喜欢
<7-15,ESPOSITO>Ooh, I like that.

216
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,400
<7-16,CASTLE>成功  又来一本畅销书
<7-16,CASTLE>"Bam," said the lady. Another best seller for me.

217
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,600
<7-17,BECKETT>孩子们情况如何
<7-17,BECKETT>What happened to the kids?

218
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,800
<7-18,ESPOSITO>和梅勒妮的父母住在白平原
<7-18,ESPOSITO>Living with Melanie's parents up in White Plains.

219
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,200
<7-19,BECKETT>看来我要去白平原一趟了
<7-19,BECKETT>Well, looks like I’m going to White Plains.

220
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,700
<7-19,BECKETT>详查建筑工地
<7-19,BECKETT>Canvass the construction site.

221
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,000
<7-19,BECKETT>肯定有人看到过什么
<7-19,BECKETT>Someone must've seen something.

222
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,300
<7-20,ESPOSITO>是的  工头说
<7-20,ESPOSITO>Yeah, the foreman said that, uh,

223
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,700
<7-20,ESPOSITO>晚上总有流浪汉来找麻烦
<7-20,ESPOSITO>They have a problem with the homeless at night,

224
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,000
<7-20,ESPOSITO>所以我想晚点去那儿一趟
<7-20,ESPOSITO>So I figured I’d go down there later,

225
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,700
<7-20,ESPOSITO>看看能否在工地抓到他们
<7-20,ESPOSITO>Try to catch 'em at the site.

226
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,200
<7-21,CASTLE>流浪汉  白平原  流浪汉  白平原
<7-21,CASTLE>Homeless, White Plains. Homeless, White Plains.

227
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
<7-22,ESPOSITO>都有点诡异
<7-22,ESPOSITO>They're both kinda creepy.

228
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,700
<7-22,ESPOSITO>好吧
<7-22,ESPOSITO>All right.

229
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,700
<8-1,BEN DAVIDSON>吓到你们了吗
<8-1,BEN DAVIDSON>Did I scare ya?

230
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
<8-2,BECKETT>戴维逊先生

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
<8-4,BECKETT>能找个地方谈谈吗
<8-4,BECKETT>Is there somewhere we could talk?

234
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>好的  我们进去谈
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>Yes. Why don't we go inside?

235
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,200
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>姑娘们  别到马路上玩
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>Girls, don't play in the street, okay?

236
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>好的  外公一会儿就出来
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>All right. Grandpa will be out in a minute.

237
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,600
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>我想我们早就知道
<8-5,BEN DAVIDSON>I- I think we've both known for a while now

238
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,400
<9-1,JULIE DAVIDSON>梅勒妮不会回家来了
<9-1,JULIE DAVIDSON>That Melanie was not going to come home.

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,880
<9-2,BECKETT>你还记得
<9-2,BECKETT>What do you remember

240
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,100
<9-2,BECKETT>在她失踪的前几天发生过什么吗
<9-2,BECKETT>About the days leading up to her disappearance?

241
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
<9-3,BEN DAVIDSON>我们几天前和她聊过
<9-3,BEN DAVIDSON>Well, uh, we talked to her a couple days before--

242
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,500
<9-3,BEN DAVIDSON>我是说  我太太跟她聊过
<9-3,BEN DAVIDSON>Uh, my wife did, I mean.

243
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,900
<9-4,JULIE DAVIDSON>看起来一切正常
<9-4,JULIE DAVIDSON>Everything seemed fine.

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
<9-5,BECKETT>没有任何迹象显示她要离开吗
<9-5,BECKETT>She didn't indicate in any way that she was leaving?

245
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
<9-6,JULIE DAVIDSON>没有
<9-6,JULIE DAVIDSON>No.

246
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,600
<9-7,CASTLE>我们知道你女儿有些问题
<9-7,CASTLE>We're aware your daughter had some issues.

247
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
<9-8,BEN DAVIDSON>那跟她的失踪没有关系
<9-8,BEN DAVIDSON>That had nothing to do with what happened here.

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,100
<9-9,CASTLE>你怎么知道
<9-9,CASTLE>How do you know?

249
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,600
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>你现在的语气就跟
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>You know, now you sound like

250
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,900
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>第一个处理这案子的警察一样
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>The cop who first had the case--

251
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,010
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>确信她出走了
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>Convinced she'd run away,

252
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,500
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>确信她还在吸毒
<9-10,BEN DAVIDSON>Convinced she was still on drugs.

253
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,000
<9-11,BECKETT>可你不那么想
<9-11,BECKETT>But you didn't think that.

254
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,700
<9-11,BECKETT>梅勒妮
<9-11,BECKETT>Melanie...

255
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,100
<9-12,BEN DAVIDSON>或许不是最好的母亲
<9-12,BEN DAVIDSON>Wasn't the greatest of moms...

256
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
<9-12,BEN DAVIDSON>但她爱她的孩子
<9-12,BEN DAVIDSON>But she loved her kids.

257
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,800
<9-12,BEN DAVIDSON>她永远也不会离开他们的
<9-12,BEN DAVIDSON>She would've never left them.

258
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,800
<9-13,BECKETT>她的丈夫山姆怎么想
<9-13,BECKETT>What about her husband Sam?

259
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,400
<9-14,JULIE DAVIDSON>他也觉得是因为毒品
<9-14,JULIE DAVIDSON>He thought it was drugs, too.

260
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,520
<9-15,BEN DAVIDSON>你们知道他等了一天
<9-15,BEN DAVIDSON>You know he waited over a day

261
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,100
<9-15,BEN DAVIDSON>才去报失踪的吗
<9-15,BEN DAVIDSON>Before he reported her missing?

262
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
<9-16,CASTLE>她以前也出走过
<9-16,CASTLE>She had run off before.

263
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>我不会否认这个
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>Look, I’m not gonna sit here and deny that,

264
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,700
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>但如果山姆觉得我女儿又吸毒了
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>But if Sam thought our daughter was in trouble,

265
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,500
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>为什么她失踪后他没有马上报警
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>Why didn't he report her missing right away?

266
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>为什么他没有寻求帮助
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>Why didn't he call for help?

267
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,630
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>就算她被抓起来了
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>Even if she'd gotten locked up,

268
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,900
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>也会比现在好
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>She'd have been better off than--

269
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,600
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>天哪  这有什么区别
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>Oh, what the hell's the difference? I mean,

270
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,000
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>该问这些问题的时间是五年前
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>The time to ask these questions was five years ago,

271
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,830
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>但处理这案子的警察
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>But the cop who was on the case

272
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,100
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>却什么都没有问
<9-17,BEN DAVIDSON>Then didn't want to ask them.

273
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,860
<10-1,CASTLE>听起来他们对当初的调查
<10-1,CASTLE>Sounds like they were pretty unhappy

274
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,500
<10-1,CASTLE>很不满意
<10-1,CASTLE>With the original investigation.

275
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
<10-2,BECKETT>他们完全有理由不满
<10-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, they had every reason to be.

276
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,600
<10-3,CASTLE>当初负责此案的警察
<10-3,CASTLE>The guy whose case it was--

277
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,500
<10-3,CASTLE>你认识吗
<10-3,CASTLE>You know him?

278
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,100
<10-4,BECKETT>不认识   斯隆警官比我早当警察很久
<10-4,BECKETT>No. Detective Sloan was before my time.

279
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,300
<10-5,CASTLE>他还在职吗
<10-5,CASTLE>He still around?

280
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,700
<10-6,BECKETT>如果在新泽西当警长也算的话
<10-6,BECKETT>Well, if you count being a sheriff in Jersey,

281
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
<10-6,BECKETT>那他还在职
<10-6,BECKETT>Then yeah, he's still around.

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,900
<10-6,BECKETT>梅勒妮·卡瓦诺
<10-6,BECKETT>Melanie Kavanaugh.

283
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,100
<11-1,SHERIFF SLOAN>这么多年后总算找到她了
<11-1,SHERIFF SLOAN>So she was finally found after all these years, huh?

284
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,800
<11-2,BECKETT>只找到了她的尸体
<11-2,BECKETT>She wasn't found. Her body was.

285
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,400
<11-3,SHERIFF SLOAN>我很遗憾
<11-3,SHERIFF SLOAN>I'm sorry to hear that.

286
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,300
<11-3,SHERIFF SLOAN>从我接手那个案子
<11-3,SHERIFF SLOAN>You know, from the moment I took that case,

287
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
<11-3,SHERIFF SLOAN>我就觉得结果不会好
<11-3,SHERIFF SLOAN>I figured it was gonna end bad.

288
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,210
<11-4,BECKETT>她的父母告诉我们
<11-4,BECKETT>Her parents led us to believe

289
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,100
<11-4,BECKETT>你很肯定她是离家出走了
<11-4,BECKETT>That you were pretty sure that she'd run off.

290
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,100
<11-5,SHERIFF SLOAN>她死亡还是离家出走
<11-5,SHERIFF SLOAN>Her being found dead and her running off

291
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
<11-5,SHERIFF SLOAN>就她的历史来看并不矛盾
<11-5,SHERIFF SLOAN>Are not exactly incompatible, not with her history.

292
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,490
<11-6,CASTLE>她的父母还认为你的调查
<11-6,CASTLE>Her parents also believe your investigation

293
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,800
<11-6,CASTLE>从没偏离过她的历史
<11-6,CASTLE>Never made it past her history.

294
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,000
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>我调查的是失踪  并不是谋杀
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>I was on a missing persons, not a murder.

295
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,900
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>你们有具尸体
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>You have a dead body.

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,500
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>我有的只是一个有吸毒史的女人
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>All I had was a- a woman with a drug habit

297
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,800
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>还有  失踪史
<11-7,SHERIFF SLOAN>And a history of, uh, disappearing.

298
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,480
<11-8,BECKETT>但是他的丈夫在她失踪一天后
<11-8,BECKETT>And a husband who didn't report her missing

299
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,000
<11-8,BECKETT>才报的警
<11-8,BECKETT>For over a day.

300
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,200
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>别放马后炮了
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>Don't you dare play Monday morning quarterback with me.

301
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,000
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>亲爱的  他很合作
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>Look, sweetheart, he cooperated.

302
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,300
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>他主动让犯罪现场调查组进屋查看
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>He voluntarily allowed C.S.U. Into their apartment.

303
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,600
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>我所有的要求  他都照办了
<11-9,SHERIFF SLOAN>Anything I asked, he did.

304
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,800
<11-10,CASTLE>你知道他也被谋杀了吗
<11-10,CASTLE>Did you know he was murdered, too?

305
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,600
<11-11,BECKETT>在街上被枪杀的  一年多前
<11-11,BECKETT>Gunned down on the street, over a year ago.

306
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,100
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>你们想从我这儿知道什么
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>Look, what do you want from me?

307
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>我们已经报告了她在费城
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>We had reports of her in Philly with

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>有个磕药的前男友的
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>A meth head ex-boyfriend.

309
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,100
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>那都是过去的事了
<11-12,SHERIFF SLOAN>I mean, it was what it was.

310
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
<11-13,BECKETT>但你从没去调查一下
<11-13,BECKETT>But you didn't even go down to check it out.

311
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
<11-14,SHERIFF SLOAN>不需要  已经报告了
<11-14,SHERIFF SLOAN>Didn't need to. Had reports.

312
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,500
<11-15,BECKETT>对  她丈夫最好的朋友查尔斯·怀勒说的
<11-15,BECKETT>Right. From her husband's best friend Charles Wyler.

313
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,500
<11-17,CASTLE>-所以呢  -所以他有可能会不客观
<11-17,CASTLE>- So? - He's not exactly an impartial observer.

314
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,270
<11-18,SHERIFF SLOAN>他有自己的生意  有家庭
<11-18,SHERIFF SLOAN>The guy owned his own business. He had a family.

315
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,500
<11-18,SHERIFF SLOAN>他还是个退伍老兵
<11-18,SHERIFF SLOAN>He was a war vet.

316
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,300
<11-18,SHERIFF SLOAN>没理由怀疑他的证词
<11-18,SHERIFF SLOAN>I saw no reason to doubt his word.

317
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,000
<11-19,CASTLE>而且  费城很远
<11-19,CASTLE>Plus, Philly's a pretty long drive.

318
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
<11-20,SHERIFF SLOAN>她只是失踪了
<11-20,SHERIFF SLOAN>She was only missing back then.

319
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,900
<11-21,BECKETT>不  警长  她当时已经死了
<11-21,BECKETT>No, sheriff, she was already dead.

320
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,000
<11-21,BECKETT>你只是不知道而已
<11-21,BECKETT>You just didn't know it yet.

321
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
<12-1,CASTLE>如果哪天我失踪了
<12-1,CASTLE>I ever disappear,

322
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
<12-1,CASTLE>你别让这家伙调查我的案子
<12-1,CASTLE>Make sure this guy's not on my case.

323
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,400
<12-2,BECKETT>我讨厌他那样的警察
<12-2,BECKETT>I hate cops like him.

324
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,300
<12-2,BECKETT>像他那样的人  思想僵化
<12-2,BECKETT>Guys like him-- things only make sense if they fit in a box.

325
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,200
<12-2,BECKETT>他们固执己见  让凶手跑了
<12-2,BECKETT>So they make 'em fit, and murderer go free.

326
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
<12-3,CASTLE>你父亲也有这样的遭遇吗
<12-3,CASTLE>Is that what happened to your dad?

327
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
<12-4,BECKETT>我父亲
<12-4,BECKETT>My dad?

328
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
<12-5,CASTLE>我注意到你的手表
<12-5,CASTLE>I noticed your watch.

329
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,200
<12-6,CASTLE>是你父亲的  是吗
<12-6,CASTLE>It's your dad's, right?

330
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
<12-6,CASTLE>所以你戴着它
<12-6,CASTLE>That's why you wear it?

332
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
<13-1,BECKETT>你找到目击者了
<13-1,BECKETT>You find a witness?

333
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
<13-1,BECKETT>对  一个流浪汉
<13-1,BECKETT>Yeah, homeless guy.

334
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,300
<13-2,ESPOSITO>给他点钱他就说了
<13-2,ESPOSITO>A couple of bucks jogged his memory.

335
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,660
<13-3,RYAN>他说看到一辆有凹痕的黄色卡车
<13-3,RYAN>Said he saw a dented yellowtruck

336
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,300
<13-3,RYAN>开到了这个位置
<13-3,RYAN>Pull up to the site.

337
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
<13-3,RYAN>一个强壮的家伙从后面拉出个大包
<13-3,RYAN>Heavyset guy pulls a large bag out of the back,

338
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,630
<13-3,RYAN>而他再出来的时候
<13-3,RYAN>And when he comes out,

339
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,200
<13-3,RYAN>包不见了
<13-3,RYAN>He doesn't have the bag anymore.

340
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,700
<13-4,BECKETT>你怎么找到这里的
<13-4,BECKETT>How'd you find this place?

341
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,870
<13-5,ESPOSITO>他还记得卡车的
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Guy also remembered the word "storage"

342
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,100
<13-5,ESPOSITO>一边写着  仓库
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Written on the side of the truck.

343
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,000
<13-6,RYAN>我们找了全部仓库
<13-6,RYAN>We searched all the storage

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
<13-6,RYAN>发现这里用黄色卡车
<13-6,RYAN>And found that this one uses yellow trucks.

345
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,800
<13-8,BECKETT>这卡车是谁的
<13-8,BECKETT>So who owns the trucks?

346
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,700
<13-9,RYAN>根据车管部的资料  是阿尔伯特·波朗德
<13-9,RYAN>According to the D.M.V., Albert Bolland.

347
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,430
<14-1,ALBERT>什么尸体
<14-1,ALBERT>What body?

348
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,000
<14-1,ALBERT>我不知道你们在说什么
<14-1,ALBERT>I don't know what you're talking about.

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
<14-2,BECKETT>目击者说看到有人开着你的黄色卡车
<14-2,BECKETT>A witness saw someone driving one of your yellow trucks

350
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
<14-2,BECKETT>去弃尸
<14-2,BECKETT>And dumping the body.

351
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,800
<14-3,ALBERT>你说谎  没人看到
<14-3,ALBERT>You're lying. No one saw.

352
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,900
<14-4,CASTLE>也许你该先否认去过那里吧
<14-4,CASTLE>Ouch. Wow. Maybe you should've tried denying it first?

353
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
<14-5,BECKETT>我来帮帮你
<14-5,BECKETT>Let me help you.

354
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,780
<14-5,BECKETT>梅勒妮·卡瓦诺  两个孩子的母亲
<14-5,BECKETT>Melanie Kavanaugh, mother of two.

355
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,000
<14-5,BECKETT>山姆·卡瓦诺的妻子
<14-5,BECKETT>Wife of Sam Kavanaugh.

356
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,600
<14-6,ALBERT>好吧  我承认弃尸
<14-6,ALBERT>Okay, look, I dumped her,

357
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,620
<14-7,BECKETT>-但我发誓我没有  -你没有杀她  对吗
<14-7,BECKETT>- But I swear I didn't-- - You didn't kill her, right?

358
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,400
<14-8,ALBERT>对
<14-8,ALBERT>That's right.

359
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,650
<14-8,ALBERT>我发现了她
<14-8,ALBERT>I found her.

360
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,600
<14-10,ALBERT>我不知道她在那儿
<14-10,ALBERT>I never even knew she was here.

361
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,500
<14-11,CASTLE>哪儿
<14-11,CASTLE>What do you mean "here"?

362
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,100
<14-12,ALBERT>在六楼
<14-12,ALBERT>Sixth floor.

363
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,100
<14-12,ALBERT>如果房客欠租金的话
<14-12,ALBERT>Renters were in arrears.

364
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
<14-12,ALBERT>我们通常给他们三个月期限
<14-12,ALBERT>We usually give 'em three months,

365
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
<14-12,ALBERT>然后撬锁卖货来抵欠款
<14-12,ALBERT>And then we cut the locks and we sell their belongings.

366
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
<14-12,ALBERT>但这次  我只发现了个冷藏柜
<14-12,ALBERT>Only this time, all I find is a freezer

367
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,700
<14-12,ALBERT>插在照明电源上
<14-12,ALBERT>Plugged into a light outlet,

368
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,700
<14-12,ALBERT>顺便说一下  这种行为完全不合法
<14-12,ALBERT>Which, by the way, is totally illegal.

369
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,390
<14-12,ALBERT>你不觉得
<14-12,ALBERT>You didn't think

370
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,300
<14-13,BECKETT>把尸体塞在冷藏柜里是违法的吗
<14-13,BECKETT>It was illegal to store a dead body in a freezer?

371
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,600
<14-14,ALBERT>你以为我知道吗
<14-14,ALBERT>You think I knew?

372
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,400
<14-14,ALBERT>我打开冰箱的时候  差点犯心脏病了
<14-14,ALBERT>When I opened it up, I nearly had a heart attack.

373
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,900
<14-15,BECKETT>你可以叫警察的
<14-15,BECKETT>You could call the cops

374
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,710
<14-16,ALBERT>然后上账簿网((纽约时报旗下报纸)头版
<14-16,ALBERT>So I could make the front page of "the ledger"?

375
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,700
<14-16,ALBERT>这对我的生意太好了
<14-16,ALBERT>Yeah, that's good for business.

376
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,390
<14-16,ALBERT>如果是黑帮作案怎么办
<14-16,ALBERT>What if it's a mob hit?

377
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,000
<14-16,ALBERT>我也有家庭
<14-16,ALBERT>I mean, I got a family.

378
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
<14-17,BECKETT>她也有家庭
<14-17,BECKETT>So did she.

379
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,600
<14-18,CASTLE>所以是你找到的她
<14-18,CASTLE>So you find her.

380
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
<14-18,CASTLE>经过理性思考
<14-18,CASTLE>Next logical step--

381
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,800
<14-18,CASTLE>把她扔到了建筑工地
<14-18,CASTLE>Dump her at a construction site?

382
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
<14-19,ALBERT>我认识个人在那儿工作
<14-19,ALBERT>I know a guy who works over there.

383
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,300
<14-19,ALBERT>所以当我发现尸体时
<14-19,ALBERT>So when I find the body, I figure,

384
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,300
<14-19,ALBERT>我就想到了那个地方
<14-19,ALBERT>That's the place, right?

385
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,400
<14-20,BECKETT>带我们去你找到她的地方
<14-20,BECKETT>Show us where you found her.

386
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,800
<15-1,BECKETT>在这里五年了
<15-1,BECKETT>Five years in there.

387
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,800
<15-1,BECKETT>没有人应该被这么对待
<15-1,BECKETT>Nobody deserves that.

388
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,900
<15-1,BECKETT>他们通过什么方式为这个仓库付款
<15-1,BECKETT>How'd they make payments for the unit?

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
<15-1,BECKETT>支票还是信用卡
<15-1,BECKETT>Check? Credit card?

390
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,400
<15-2,ALBERT>现金  每六个月付一次
<15-2,ALBERT>Cash. Every six months.

391
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
<15-2,ALBERT>但他们有三个多月没付了
<15-2,ALBERT>But like I said, they were three months overdue.

392
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,700
<15-3,BECKETT>最后一次付款
<15-3,BECKETT>Puts the last payment

393
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
<15-3,BECKETT>是在她丈夫被杀两个月后
<15-3,BECKETT>At two months after her husband was killed.

394
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
<15-4,CASTLE>死人是不会付款的
<15-4,CASTLE>How to make payments when he was dead ?

395
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,970
<15-5,BECKETT>你办公室的摄像头
<15-5,BECKETT>That camera in your office--

396
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,800
<15-5,BECKETT>有没有拍下付款的人
<15-5,BECKETT>You got footage of the guy who made payments?

397
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,400
<15-6,ALBERT>已经是九个月以前的事了
<15-6,ALBERT>That was nine months ago.

398
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,500
<15-6,ALBERT>我们一次只保存近两周的录像
<15-6,ALBERT>We keep maybe two weeks at a time.

399
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
<15-7,BECKETT>看起来斯隆是对的
<15-7,BECKETT>Looks like Sloan was right.

400
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,400
<15-7,BECKETT>山姆·卡瓦诺跟此案无关
<15-7,BECKETT>Sam Kavanaugh didn't have anything to do with it.

401
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
<15-8,CASTLE>如果不是山姆  那又是谁呢
<15-8,CASTLE>Well, if not Sam, then who?

402
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
<16-1,ALEXIS>我们有空调的
<16-1,ALEXIS>You know, we have air-conditioning.

403
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,600
<16-2,CASTLE>我只是想搞清楚
<16-2,CASTLE>I'm just trying to figure out

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,800
<16-2,CASTLE>为什么有人会把尸体放到冷藏柜里
<16-2,CASTLE>Why someone would put a dead body in a freezer.

405
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,900
<16-3,ALEXIS>是妮奇·希特  还是贝克特探长遇到的难题
<16-3,ALEXIS>Is this a Nikki Heat or detective Beckett question?

406
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,600
<16-4,CASTLE>-贝克特  -这就对了
<16-4,CASTLE>- Beckett.  - Oh, that's right.

407
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,270
<16-5,ALEXIS>妮奇·希特的问题
<16-5,ALEXIS>The Nikki Heat thing was about

408
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,400
<16-5,ALEXIS>是关于在自洁式烤箱里焚尸
<16-5,ALEXIS>Incinerating a body in a self-cleaning oven.

409
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,000
<16-6,CASTLE>你把东西放到冰箱里是为了以后用
<16-6,CASTLE>I mean, you put things in a freezer to keep 'em for later,

410
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,600
<16-6,CASTLE>但一旦把它们放进来
<16-6,CASTLE>But once they're there,

411
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,500
<16-6,CASTLE>你就很少再会拿出来用了
<16-6,CASTLE>You rarely ever go back.

412
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,600
<16-7,ALEXIS>如果我把一具尸体放进冰箱
<16-7,ALEXIS>If I was putting a body in a freezer,

413
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,500
<16-7,ALEXIS>肯定是因为我想藏尸
<16-7,ALEXIS>It'd be because I was trying to hide it.

414
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,800
<16-8,CASTLE>直到不再为仓库付款
<16-8,CASTLE>Until you stopped paying for the storage space.

415
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,800
<16-9,ALEXIS>是我不付款  还是我不能付款
<16-9,ALEXIS>Did I stop, or did something stop me?

416
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,900
<16-10,CASTLE>像这样的家庭时光  我永远也忘不了
<16-10,CASTLE>It's family moments like these I will never forget.

417
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,500
<16-11,ALEXIS>要是和一个很好的心理学家
<16-11,ALEXIS>With a good therapist,

418
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
<16-11,ALEXIS>或许我会的
<16-11,ALEXIS>Hopefully I will.

419
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,100
<16-11,ALEXIS>怀勒先生
<16-11,ALEXIS>Mr. Wyler,

420
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,600
<17-1,BECKETT>当初调查梅勒妮失踪案的警察
<17-1,BECKETT>The detective investigating Melanie's disappearance

421
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,810
<17-1,BECKETT>说你告诉他
<17-1,BECKETT>Said that you told him that

422
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,900
<17-1,BECKETT>梅勒妮去费城看前男友了 是吗
<17-1,BECKETT>She went to an ex-boyfriend in Philadelphia?

423
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,800
<17-2,WYLER>没有  我只告诉了他山姆对我说的事情
<17-2,WYLER>No, I only told him what Sam told me.

424
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,300
<17-3,BECKETT>山姆告诉你的
<17-3,BECKETT>Sam told you?

425
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,570
<17-4,WYLER>她在婚礼前去过那里
<17-4,WYLER>It's where she went before the wedding

426
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,700
<17-4,WYLER>结婚后又去了几次
<17-4,WYLER>And a few times after.

427
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
<17-5,BECKETT>但你不确定这次她去了哪里
<17-5,BECKETT>But you're not sure that's where she went.

428
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,000
<17-6,WYLER>只有这样才说得通
<17-6,WYLER>It's the only thing that made sense.

429
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,330
<17-6,WYLER>梅勒妮是个好人
<17-6,WYLER>Melanie was a good person,

430
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,500
<17-6,WYLER>但她很麻烦
<17-6,WYLER>But Melanie was... Troubled.

431
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
<17-6,WYLER>有时候心情不好
<17-6,WYLER>Sometimes when things got hard,

432
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,300
<17-6,WYLER>她就出去疯去了
<17-6,WYLER>She'd go out and score, you know?

433
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,300
<17-6,WYLER>醉醺醺地回家  骂山姆毁了她的生活
<17-6,WYLER>Come home high, accuse Sam of ruining her life.

434
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,500
<17-6,WYLER>他已经给了她一切
<17-6,WYLER>He'd given her everything.

435
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,000
<17-7,BECKETT>你还记得她前男友的名字吗
<17-7,BECKETT>Do you remember the name of the boyfriend?

436
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,800
<17-8,WYLER>凯文·亨森
<17-8,WYLER>Kevin Henson

437
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
<17-8,WYLER>如果梅勒妮出了什么事
<17-8,WYLER>If something happened to Melanie,

438
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
<17-8,WYLER>他就是那个唯一知情的人
<17-8,WYLER>He's the one who would know what.

439
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,000
<18-1,BECKETT>凯文·亨森  梅勒妮的前男友
<18-1,BECKETT>Kevin Henson-- Melanie's ex-boyfriend.

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
<18-1,BECKETT>他在新泽西南部戒了一年毒
<18-1,BECKETT>He's serving a year for meth in south Jersey.

441
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,120
<18-1,BECKETT>他刚好在是在仓库
<18-1,BECKETT>He went in just after the last payment

442
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,800
<18-1,BECKETT>收到最后一次付款后进去的
<18-1,BECKETT>Was made on the storage unit.

443
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,900
<18-2,CASTLE>他没法儿付款  仓库的人就发现了尸体
<18-2,CASTLE>He stops payment, the storage guy finds her body.

444
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,100
<18-2,CASTLE>太巧合了
<18-2,CASTLE>Quite a coincidence.

445
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,460
<18-3,BECKETT>而且当她丈夫被杀的时候
<18-3,BECKETT>And he was also on the outside

446
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,500
<18-3,BECKETT>他正好离开了戒毒所
<18-3,BECKETT>When her husband was whacked.

447
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,700
<18-3,BECKETT>听起来我们有必要去趟南新泽西
<18-3,BECKETT>Sounds like he's worth a trip to south Jersey.

448
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
<19-1,HENSON>你曾经爱过吗  探长
<19-1,HENSON>You ever been in love, detective?

449
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
<19-1,HENSON>它让你疯狂
<19-1,HENSON>It makes you do crazy things.

450
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,500
<19-2,BECKETT>比如说杀人
<19-2,BECKETT>Like kill someone?

451
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,500
<19-3,HENSON>梅勒妮和我  我们在一起的时候
<19-3,HENSON>Mel and I, when we were together,

452
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
<19-3,HENSON>时间就像静止了
<19-3,HENSON>Time just stopped.

453
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
<19-3,HENSON>但在我们相爱的第一天  她和我
<19-3,HENSON>But even the first day, her and me--

454
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
<19-3,HENSON>我们就知道  我们不合适
<19-3,HENSON>We both knew it was never gonna work.

455
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
<19-3,HENSON>她的父母永远也不会
<19-3,HENSON>God knows her folks were never gonna

456
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,300
<19-3,HENSON>让宝贝女儿跟这样的人在一起
<19-3,HENSON>Let their little girl end up with some...

457
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,600
<19-3,HENSON>一个满身纹身的瘾君子
<19-3,HENSON>Tatted-up addict.

458
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,900
<19-3,HENSON>但有时候
<19-3,HENSON>But sometimes, see,

459
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
<19-3,HENSON>有时候我们单独在一起
<19-3,HENSON>Sometimes when we were alone together...

460
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,900
<19-3,HENSON>有时候我们几乎相信  我们会在一起
<19-3,HENSON>Sometimes we almost believed.

461
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,100
<19-4,CASTLE>她想要离开山姆
<19-4,CASTLE>She was gonna leave Sam.

462
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,300
<19-4,CASTLE>所以她来找你
<19-4,CASTLE>That's why she came to see you.

463
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,000
<19-5,HENSON>她发现她丈夫有了外遇
<19-5,HENSON>She found out he was having an affair.

464
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,800
<19-5,HENSON>他想要离开她  拿走孩子的监护权
<19-5,HENSON>He was gonna leave her and get custody of the kids,

465
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,500
<19-5,HENSON>你知道  因为她吸毒
<19-5,HENSON>You know, because of the drugs.

466
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,500
<19-5,HENSON>她想要我和她一起走  带着孩子就此消失
<19-5,HENSON>She wanted me to go with her, take the kids, just disappear.

467
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,600
<19-6,BECKETT>所以你做了什么
<19-6,BECKETT>So what'd you do?

468
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,510
<19-7,HENSON>只是送她上了公共汽车
<19-7,HENSON>Put her on a bus.

469
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,700
<19-8,CASTLE>你送她离开了
<19-8,CASTLE>You sent her away?

470
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,800
<19-9,HENSON>她想要的  我给不了她
<19-9,HENSON>What she wanted, I couldn't give her.

471
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,800
<19-9,HENSON>第二天  我就去了戒毒所
<19-9,HENSON>Checked into rehab the next day.

472
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
<19-9,HENSON>我想如果我可以戒掉毒瘾
<19-9,HENSON>I thought if I could get clean...

473
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,700
<19-9,HENSON>所以她失踪的时候  我正在戒毒所里
<19-9,HENSON>That's where I was when she disappeared.

474
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,500
<19-9,HENSON>而我出来的时候  她死了
<19-9,HENSON>By the time I got out, she was dead.

475
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,800
<19-10,BECKETT>你怎么肯定她死了呢
<19-10,BECKETT>How could you be sure she was dead.

476
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,300
<19-11,HENSON>她没再打过电话
<19-11,HENSON>She stopped calling.

477
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,300
<19-11,HENSON>如果她还活着  她会给我打电话的
<19-11,HENSON>If she was alive, she would've called.

478
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,800
<20-1,CASTLE>外遇可以解释很多问题
<20-1,CASTLE>Well, an affair certainly explains a lot.

479
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,800
<20-1,CASTLE>山姆杀了梅勒妮
<20-1,CASTLE>Sam kills Melanie,

480
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,200
<20-1,CASTLE>或是他和他的情人一起杀了梅勒妮
<20-1,CASTLE>Or he and his lover kill Melanie together.

481
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
<20-2,BECKETT>那又是谁杀了山姆
<20-2,BECKETT>Well, then who kills Sam?

482
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,550
<20-3,CASTLE>他的情人
<20-3,CASTLE>The lover,

483
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,200
<20-3,CASTLE>她为他做了这么多  他却想退出
<20-3,CASTLE>When Sam backs out after all she's done for him.

484
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,310
<20-3,CASTLE>如果他背信弃义
<20-3,CASTLE>It's not like she could go to the police

485
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,300
<20-3,CASTLE>她可不会去警察局
<20-3,CASTLE>If he broke his promise.

486
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,200
<20-4,BECKETT>你怎么会想出这些事情的  卡塞尔
<20-4,BECKETT>How do you come up with these things, Castle?

487
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
<20-5,CASTLE>不是我想出  是它们自己冒出来的
<20-5,CASTLE>I did not come up with this one. They did.

488
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,100
<20-6,BECKETT>好吧  从你们男人的角度看
<20-6,BECKETT>Okay, you speak "guy."

489
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,400
<20-6,BECKETT>如果山姆有情人  他最好的朋友会知道吗
<20-6,BECKETT>If Sam had a lover, would his best friend know about it?

490
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,000
<20-6,BECKETT>当然
<20-6,BECKETT>Yes.

491
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,500
<21-1,WYLER>探长
<21-1,WYLER>Detective.

492
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,960
<21-2,BECKETT>你对我们撒谎了  怀勒先生
<21-2,BECKETT>You lied to us, Mr. Wyler.

493
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,000
<21-3,WYLER>什么
<21-3,WYLER>Excuse me?

494
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
<21-4,CASTLE>你认为梅勒妮的失踪
<21-4,CASTLE>You don't think maybe it's relevant your buddy Sam

495
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,200
<21-4,CASTLE>和山姆当时的外遇无关吗
<21-4,CASTLE>Had an affair right about the time Melanie disappeared?

496
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
<21-5,WYLER>这是很久以前的事了
<21-5,WYLER>That was a long time ago.

497
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
<21-6,BECKETT>把所有人拖下水有意义吗
<21-6,BECKETT>The point of dragging everybody through the mud?

498
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,200
<21-6,BECKETT>他们的孩子还没受够吗
<21-6,BECKETT>Haven't their kids been through enough?

499
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,300
<21-6,BECKETT>他们就不能得到点安宁吗
<21-6,BECKETT>Don't they deserve some peace?

500
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,080
<21-7,BECKETT>他们应该得到的
<21-7,BECKETT>What they deserve is to know

501
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,900
<21-7,BECKETT>是他们母亲被害的真相
<21-7,BECKETT>What happened to their mother.

502
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,300
<21-8,WYLER>伊丽莎白·芙缇

<21-8,WYLER>Elizabeth Forte is her name.

504
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,600
<21-8,WYLER>她在山姆的银行里工作
<21-8,WYLER>She worked with Sam at his bank.

505

<22-1,BECKETT>芙缇太太  我是贝克特探长

<22-3,BECKETT>Does the name Samuel Kavanaugh ring a bell?

<22-4,ELIZABETH>他怎么了
<22-4,ELIZABETH>What about him?

511
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,650
<22-5,BECKETT>根据尸体情况判断
<22-5,BECKETT>From the looks of it,

512
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,800
<22-5,BECKETT>她的死亡时间
<22-5,BECKETT>She was killed somewhere around the time

513
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,000
<22-5,BECKETT>就在你俩有风流韵事的时候
<22-5,BECKETT>The two of you were having an affair.

<22-6,ELIZABETH>我不明白你是什么意思
<22-6,ELIZABETH>I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
<22-15,CASTLE>还爱着另一半而结束外遇的
<22-15,CASTLE>Because they realize they're still loving.

531
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
<22-15,CASTLE>他们结束一切是因为害怕
<22-15,CASTLE>They end an affair because they're scared.

583

<25-2,CASTLE>Batman fan. Figures.

586

00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,900
<25-4,CASTLE>类似的起源故事吗
<25-4,CASTLE>Similar origin stories?

588
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,300
<25-4,CASTLE>失去所爱  激发人一生与犯罪作斗争
<25-4,CASTLE>Loss of a loved one leads to a life of fighting crime.

589
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,100
<25-5,BECKETT>你就是那个与罪恶富豪做斗争的人
<25-5,BECKETT>Yes, well, you are the multimillionaire crime fighter.

590
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,300
<25-7,CASTLE>在那儿  我给书列提纲
<25-7,CASTLE>That's, uh, where I outline my books.

591
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,600
<25-7,CASTLE>真有趣
<25-7,CASTLE>That's funny.

592
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
<25-8,BECKETT>很像我们的
<25-8,BECKETT>Looks a lot like our...

593
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,600
<25-8,BECKETT>破案的分析图
<25-8,BECKETT>Murder board.

594
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,900
<25-9,CASTLE>只是我的是假的
<25-9,CASTLE>Yeah, except mine's fake.

595
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,900
<25-11,CASTLE>出什么事儿了
<25-11,CASTLE>Something wrong?

596
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,200
<25-12,BECKETT>我找不出来
<25-12,BECKETT>I can't find it.

597
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,900
<25-13,CASTLE>找不出来什么
<25-13,CASTLE>Find what?

598
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,300
<25-14,BECKETT>答案
<25-14,BECKETT>The answer.

599
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,700
<25-15,CASTLE>是山姆杀的
<25-15,CASTLE>It was Sam.

600
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,500
<25-15,CASTLE>一切合理  结局圆满
<25-15,CASTLE>Everything fits. It's a good ending.

601
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,900
<25-16,BECKETT>但没有证据  只是推测
<25-16,BECKETT>Yeah, but without proof, it's just a theory.

602
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,900
<25-16,BECKETT>那个家庭  那两个孩子
<25-16,BECKETT>And that family...those kids...

603
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,700
<25-16,BECKETT>他们需要的不只是推测
<25-16,BECKETT>They need more than just a theory.

604
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,400
<25-16,BECKETT>他们得知道一切  我也是
<25-16,BECKETT>They need to know. I need to know.

605
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,000
<25-17,CASTLE>那么  你觉得该有个结局
<25-17,CASTLE>Well, you have an ending.

606
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,800
<25-17,CASTLE>如果想彻底弄清  你得往回调查
<25-17,CASTLE>You want the rest, you need to work backwards.

607
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,100
<25-17,CASTLE>这样事情才有个了断
<25-17,CASTLE>You need to finish the story.

608
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,000
<25-17,CASTLE>你知道结局  你知道谁是凶手
<25-17,CASTLE>You have an ending. You have your killer.

609
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,100
<25-17,CASTLE>你只需要把手里的事实整合在一起
<25-17,CASTLE>You just have to put it all together with the facts at hand.

610
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,500
<25-18,BECKETT>什么事实
<25-18,BECKETT>The facts?

611
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,100
<25-19,CASTLE>事实是  他们有两个小孩
<25-19,CASTLE>Fact...They had two small children.

612
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,200
<33-7,CASTLE>-那所以呢  -根据警方的供述
<33-7,CASTLE>- So?  - Based on police statements.

613
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,800
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>丈夫上班的时候
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>They didn't have baby sitter.

614
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,220
<25-19,CASTLE>他们并没有请保姆
<25-19,CASTLE>With him at work.

615
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,410
<25-20,BECKETT>妻子失踪时
<25-20,BECKETT>She would've had to have been

616
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,600
<25-21,CASTLE>应该是和孩子们在一起
<25-21,CASTLE>With the kids she disappeared.

617
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,900
<25-22,BECKETT>但山姆说当晚  后来她出去了
<25-22,BECKETT>But Sam said that she left later that night.

618
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,900
<25-23,CASTLE>不过门卫也没证实这一点
<25-23,CASTLE>Which the doorman was never able to corroborate.

619
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
<25-24,BECKETT>如果她一直都在家  那么
<25-24,BECKETT>So if she was there and she never left, then...

620
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,600
<25-25,CASTLE>那她就是在家里被杀的
<25-25,CASTLE>Then she was murdered in the apartment.

621
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,200
<25-27,CASTLE>还有一点  他住在曼哈顿
<25-27,CASTLE>Another fact he lived in Manhattan.

622
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,100
<25-28,BECKETT>和市里的多数人一样  他没有车
<25-28,BECKETT>And like most people in the city, he didn't own a car.

623
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,790
<25-29,CASTLE>那么住在曼哈顿的模范丈夫
<25-29,CASTLE>So what is a good husband...

624
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,300
<25-29,CASTLE>会怎么处理他妻子的尸体呢
<25-29,CASTLE>...to do living in Manhattan with his wife's body?

625
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
<25-29,CASTLE>他不能把尸体留在家里
<25-29,CASTLE>He can't leave it in the apartment.

626
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,100
<25-29,CASTLE>他也不能带着尸体穿过大厅
<25-29,CASTLE>He can't walk out the lobby with it.

627
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,300
<25-29,CASTLE>那么  唯一的问题是
<25-29,CASTLE>So the only question is...

628
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,800
<25-30,BECKETT>他是怎样把尸体运到仓库的
<25-30,BECKETT>How did he get the body to the storage unit?

629
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,500
<25-31,CASTLE>他
<25-31,CASTLE>He...

630
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,700
<25-31,CASTLE>可以  不行
<25-31,CASTLE>Hey, could...No.

631
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,100
<25-32,CASTLE>-知道什么有用吗  -什么
<25-32,CASTLE>- You know what helps?  - Yeah?

632
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,500
<25-33,BECKETT>有时当我试着弄明白
<25-33,BECKETT>Sometimes when I'm trying to figure out...

633
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,900
<25-34,CASTLE>小说里的角色会怎么做
<25-34,CASTLE>... How a character of man does something.

634
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,900
<25-34,CASTLE>我会去犯罪现场走走
<25-34,CASTLE>I will walk the crime scene.

635
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,400
<25-34,CASTLE>有一次  我试想
<25-34,CASTLE>This one time, I was trying to figure out...

636
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,900
<25-34,CASTLE>怎样把人从帝国大厦里扔出去
<25-34,CASTLE>How to throw someone off the Empire State Building.

637
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,100
<25-34,CASTLE>当时《西雅图不眠夜》刚上映
<25-34,CASTLE>And that movie "Sleepless in Seattle" had just come out.

638
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,500
<25-35,BECKETT>好多寂寞的女人靠近我
<25-35,BECKETT>Oh, so many lonely women approached me.

639
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,050
<25-35,BECKETT>想着我是她们的汤姆·汉克斯  我就
<25-35,BECKETT>Thinking I was their Tom Hanks. I got...

640
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,600
<25-35,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<25-35,BECKETT>Castle.

641
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,900
<25-36,CASTLE>关键是  你应该了解凶手的想法
<25-36,CASTLE>The point is, you want to get into a killer's head.

642
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,700
<25-36,CASTLE>去凶手去过的地方
<25-36,CASTLE>Go to where the killer was ...

643
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,100
<25-36,CASTLE>看有什么需要解决的问题
<25-36,CASTLE>... And see what problems here to face.

644
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,200
<25-36,CASTLE>实地考察
<25-36,CASTLE>Field trip?

645
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,300
<26-1,ROGER>他们告诉我  他是被劫杀
<26-1,ROGER>They told me he was shot in a mugging.

646
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,160
<26-1,ROGER>现在你们告诉我
<26-1,ROGER>And now you're telling me

647

<26-1,ROGER>他是在这屋子被杀的
<26-1,ROGER>He was killed here in my appartment.

648
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,900
<26-2,CASTLE>不是他  是他妻子
<26-2,CASTLE>Not him,  his wife.

<26-3,ROGER>她妻子  这是个什么样的家庭呀
<26-3,ROGER>His wife? What kind of family was this?

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,800
<26-6,CASTLE>放松  只是假装
<26-6,CASTLE>Relax. It's just pretend.

653
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,400
<26-7,BECKETT>-不想假装  -怕自己喜欢这感觉
<26-7,BECKETT>- I don't want to pretend.  - Scared you'll like it?

<26-9,BECKETT>好  如果我们结婚了  现在我就想离
<26-9,BECKETT>Okay, if we're married, I want a divorce.

<26-10,ROGER>Are you two like this all the time?

<26-11,CASTLE>All right, we're not married, but they were.

658
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
<26-11,CASTLE>我们就当门卫说的是对的
<26-11,CASTLE>Let's see the doorman's right.

<26-11,CASTLE>梅勒妮大概4点钟回家
<26-11,CASTLE>Now Melanie gets home about 4 o'clock.

<26-12,BECKETT>她就得给孩子们做晚饭
<26-12,BECKETT>She'd have to make dinner for the kids.

661
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,000
<26-13,CASTLE>然后山姆回家了
<26-13,CASTLE>Then Sam comes home.

662
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,100
<26-14,BECKETT>银行下班是6点左右

675
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,100
<26-28,BECKETT>他得想个办法
<26-28,BECKETT>He's got to figure out a way of

676
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,000
<26-28,BECKETT>不能让孩子们看见他移尸
<26-28,BECKETT>Getting her out of the apartment without them see it.

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,200
<26-29,CASTLE>门厅一旁的厕所
<26-29,CASTLE>Hallway bathroom.

678
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,100
<26-30,CASTLE>他需要拖延时间
<26-30,CASTLE>He needed to buy time.

679
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,150
<26-31,BECKETT>对  所以他

683
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,100

684
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,650
<26-34,CASTLE>门卫一直都没证实这点
<26-34,CASTLE>The doorman was never able to substantiate.

687
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
<26-36,ROGER>也许他叫了辆出租车
<26-36,ROGER>Maybe he hailed a cab.

688
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,500
<26-37,CASTLE>也许出租车司机和门卫还
<26-37,CASTLE>Yeah, maybe the cabbie and the doorman...

689
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,100
<26-37,CASTLE>帮他把尸体塞进后备箱呢
<26-37,CASTLE>... Helped him stuff the body in the trunk.

690
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,900
<26-37,CASTLE>-现在这活儿小费多少啊  -那个门卫
<26-37,CASTLE>- How much do you tip for that these days?  - The doorman.

691
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
<26-39,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我在开玩笑呢
<26-39,BECKETT>Castle, I'm joking.

692
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,250
<26-40,CASTLE>要是尸体在带出公寓时
<26-40,CASTLE>What if the body was already in the freezer...

693
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,500
<26-40,CASTLE>就已经放在冷藏柜里了呢
<26-40,CASTLE>... When he took it out of the apartment.

694
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,700
<26-41,ROGER>冷藏柜  那他得要一辆卡车
<26-41,ROGER>Freezer? He'd have needed a truck.

695
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,830
<26-42,CASTLE>在我住的大楼里  如果你
<26-42,CASTLE>In my building, if you have...

696
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,100
<26-42,CASTLE>有什么东西要接受或递送
<26-42,CASTLE>Something picked or deliver.

697
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
<26-43,ROGER>-得签字  -对  这里也是啊
<26-43,ROGER>- You have to sign for it.  - Yeah, here, too.

698
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,000
<26-43,ROGER>递送那么大个东西
<26-43,ROGER>A delivery that big.

699
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,900
<26-43,ROGER>你就得在登记册上登记
<26-43,ROGER>You have to sign the ledger.

700
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,700
<26-44,BECKETT>登记册
<26-44,BECKETT>The ledger?

701
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
<26-45,ROGER>登记册就在楼下门卫那里
<26-45,ROGER>The doorman's ledger downstairs.

702
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,000
<27-1,DELORIS MARSH>对  那是我的名字
<27-1,DELORIS MARSH>Yeah, that's my name.

703
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,800
<27-2,BECKETT>我知道那是五年前的事儿了  马什太太
<27-2,BECKETT>I know it was five years ago, Mrs. Marsh.

704
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
<27-2,BECKETT>但那天唯一的递送  就是送到你家
<27-2,BECKETT>But the only delivery that day was to your apartment.

705
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,960
<27-2,BECKETT>如果你还记得任何
<27-2,BECKETT>If you remember anything at all...

706
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,700
<27-2,BECKETT>有关那次递送的事儿
<27-2,BECKETT>... About the delivery...

707
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,970
<27-3,DELORIS>我记得我得下楼
<27-3,DELORIS>I... I remember I had to go downstairs

708
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,600
<27-3,DELORIS>澄清那事儿
<27-3,DELORIS>And sort everything out.

709
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,000
<27-4,BECKETT>澄清那事儿  是什么意思
<27-4,BECKETT>What do you mean "sort everything out"?

710
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,700
<27-5,DELORIS>我告诉门卫我从没定过冷藏柜
<27-5,DELORIS>I told the doorman I never ordered a freezer.

711
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
<27-5,DELORIS>但那家伙还是把它送了上来
<27-5,DELORIS>But the guy brought it on up.

712
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,630
<27-5,DELORIS>当我和门卫还在讲话时
<27-5,DELORIS>He loaded it on the freight elevator.

713
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,400
<27-5,DELORIS>他就把它装进货运电梯里
<27-5,DELORIS>While I was talking to the doorman.

714
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,600
<27-6,BECKETT>那您下去时发生了什么
<27-6,BECKETT>So what happened when you were downstairs?

715
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,600
<27-7,DELORIS>我告诉门卫  他们又把地址搞错了
<27-7,DELORIS>I told the doorman they got the wrong apartment again.

716
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,600
<27-7,DELORIS>但当我回到楼上时  那家伙已经走了
<27-7,DELORIS>And then by the time I got back upstairs, the guy was gone.

717
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,100
<27-7,DELORIS>这和那个失踪的女人有关系吗
<27-7,DELORIS>Does this have anything to do with that missing woman?

718
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
<27-8,BECKETT>对  有关系
<27-8,BECKETT>Yeah, it does.

719
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,600
<27-9,DELORIS>因为已经给另外一个警察讲了
<27-9,DELORIS>Yeah, 'cause I already told the other cop.

720
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,900
<27-10,BECKETT>斯隆警官吗
<27-10,BECKETT>Detective Sloan?

721
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
<27-11,DELORIS>我不知道他叫什么
<27-11,DELORIS>I don't know his name.

722
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,100
<27-11,DELORIS>但我把所有事儿都告诉他了
<27-11,DELORIS>But I told him everything.

723
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,200
<27-11,DELORIS>和对你们说的一样
<27-11,DELORIS>Same as you.

724
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,300
<28-1,CASTLE>我不明白了
<28-1,CASTLE>I don't get it.

725
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,700
<28-1,CASTLE>如果斯隆有这位老太太的记录
<28-1,CASTLE>If Sloan had that woman's report.

726
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,170
<28-1,CASTLE>他为什么没追查呢
<28-1,CASTLE>Why didn't he just follow up?

727
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,800
<28-2,BECKETT>他用不着这样
<28-2,BECKETT>He wasn't looking for this story.

728
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,300
<28-2,BECKETT>他已经把它记录下来了
<28-2,BECKETT>He'd already written it.

729
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,010
<28-3,CASTLE>那跟我们在查尔斯·怀勒的店外
<28-3,CASTLE>That's the same kind of truck...

730
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,300
<28-3,CASTLE>看到的的卡车是一样的
<28-3,CASTLE>...We saw outside Charles Wyler's store.

731
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,300
<28-4,BECKETT>他肯定和他们签订了合同的
<28-4,BECKETT>He must have a contract with them.

732
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,300
<28-5,CASTLE>如果你想请人帮忙搬重物
<28-5,CASTLE>If you wanted some help with some heavy lifting.

733
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,970
<28-5,CASTLE>你会打电话给谁呢
<28-5,CASTLE>Who would you call?

734
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,170
<28-6,BECKETT>你最好的朋友
<28-6,BECKETT>Your best friend.

735
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,520
<29-1,BECKETT>我们通过送货车租用信息
<29-1,BECKETT>We can trace the rental of the delivery truck

736
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,200
<29-1,BECKETT>找到了你  怀勒先生
<29-1,BECKETT>To you, Mr. Wyler

737
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,260
<29-1,BECKETT>如果你想的话  我可以找那位
<29-1,BECKETT>If you want,  I can bring the lady you

738
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,600
<29-1,BECKETT>你送冷藏柜的太太来认人
<29-1,BECKETT>Delivered the freezer to  in to identify you.

739
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
<29-2,WYLER>我和梅勒妮的事没有任何关系
<29-2,WYLER>Look, I had nothing to do with what happened to Melanie.

740
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,800
<29-3,CASTLE>别的你都说谎了  现在也一样吧
<29-3,CASTLE>You lied about everything else. Why not about this?

741
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,900
<29-4,WYLER>我根本没理由伤害她
<29-4,WYLER>I never had any reason to hurt her.

742
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,900
<29-5,BECKETT>但是山姆有  对吧
<29-5,BECKETT>But Sam did, right?

743
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
<29-5,BECKETT>她一直跑回前男友身边
<29-5,BECKETT>I mean, she kept going back to her ex-boyfriend.

744
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,500
<29-5,BECKETT>作为一个男人能忍多久呢
<29-5,BECKETT>How much can a guy take?

745
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,800
<29-6,WYLER>他那天晚上给我打了电话
<29-6,WYLER>He called me that night.

746
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,500
<29-6,WYLER>他说
<29-6,WYLER>He said...

747
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,400
<29-6,WYLER>他需要我马上去一趟
<29-6,WYLER>He needed me to come over right away.

748
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
<29-6,WYLER>我到的时候孩子们都睡了
<29-6,WYLER>When I got there, the kids were asleep,

749
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,500
<29-6,WYLER>梅勒妮在浴缸里
<29-6,WYLER>And Melanie was in the tub...

750
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
<29-6,WYLER>装在西装袋里
<29-6,WYLER>In a garment bag.

751
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,000
<29-6,WYLER>他说她扑向他  他失控了
<29-6,WYLER>He said she came at him, and he just snapped.

752
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,500
<29-7,CASTLE>我想说
<29-7,CASTLE>Here's an idea

753
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,600
<29-7,CASTLE>与其杀了她  为什么不离婚呢
<29-7,CASTLE>Instead of killing her, why not just get a divorce?

754
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
<29-8,WYLER>你觉得我不知道这是犯法的吗
<29-8,WYLER>You don't think I know how wrong this was?

755
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,000
<29-9,CASTLE>那为什么要冒险  去搬尸体
<29-9,CASTLE>Why did you take the risk? Why did you move that body?

756
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
<29-10,WYLER>因为这个错他承受不起
<29-10,WYLER>Because he made a very bad mistake.

757
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,900
<29-10,WYLER>孩子怎么办
<29-10,WYLER>And what about the kids?

758
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,030
<29-10,WYLER>他们的妈妈已经死了
<29-10,WYLER>Their mom is dead.

759
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,300
<29-10,WYLER>如果他去坐牢的话
<29-10,WYLER>If he goes to prison...

760
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,900
<29-11,BECKETT>所以你安排了卡车
<29-11,BECKETT>So you arranged for the truck.

761
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,400
<29-12,WYLER>他说绝不可能找到他身上的
<29-12,WYLER>He said it could never be traced back to him.

762
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,900
<29-12,WYLER>所以我们送冷藏柜给那个老太太
<29-12,WYLER>That's why we sent the freezer to the old lady,

763
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,000
<29-12,WYLER>所以我租了仓库
<29-12,WYLER>That's why I rented out the storage space,

764
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,520
<29-12,WYLER>因为我们知道警察会盯上山姆
<29-12,WYLER>Because we knew the cops would look at Sam.

765
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,100
<29-13,BECKETT>是你付租金的吗
<29-13,BECKETT>You made the payments?

766
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,400
<29-14,WYLER>因为山姆不能冒任何险
<29-14,WYLER>Sam couldn't take any chances.

767
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,300
<29-14,WYLER>他给我现金  我就
<29-14,WYLER>He'd give me the cash, and I’d...

768
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,000
<29-14,WYLER>一年去两次
<29-14,WYLER>Stop by twice a year.

769
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
<29-15,CASTLE>一共五年了
<29-15,CASTLE>For five years.

770
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,400
<29-16,WYLER>貌似比搬走她容易的多
<29-16,WYLER>It seemed a lot easier than moving her.

771
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,800
<29-17,BECKETT>那为什么没继续付租金了
<29-17,BECKETT>Why did you stop paying?

772
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,200
<29-18,WYLER>对梅勒妮的死  我很抱歉
<29-18,WYLER>Look, I'm truly sorry about what happened to Melanie.

773
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,900
<29-18,WYLER>但我应该怎么做
<29-18,WYLER>But what was I supposed to do,

774
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,700
<29-18,WYLER>一直付一辈子租金吗
<29-18,WYLER>Keep paying for the rest of my life?

775
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,400
<29-19,BECKETT>检察官会保证这一点的  怀勒先生
<29-19,BECKETT>The D.A. will make sure of that, Mr. Wyler.

776
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,040
<29-19,BECKETT>她的尸体被扔掉是因为
<29-19,BECKETT>Her body gets dumped because

777
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,600
<29-19,BECKETT>那个叫怀勒的家伙没付租金
<29-19,BECKETT>This guy Wyler didn't pay a bill?

778
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,000
<30-1,CASTLE>-这简直  -可以这么说  很冷酷
<30-1,CASTLE>- That's... - You can say it. Pretty cold.

779
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,800
<30-1,CASTLE>讽刺的是  自私的行为最终使真相大白
<30-1,CASTLE>Ironic that such a selfish act ultimately revealed the truth.

780
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,500
<30-2,BECKETT>有人一直知道真相
<30-2,BECKETT>There were people who knew the truth all along.

781
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,900
<30-2,BECKETT>但他们选择沉默
<30-2,BECKETT>They just chose not to come forward.

782
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,670
<30-2,BECKETT>但报应回来
<30-2,BECKETT>Still, karma comes back and

783
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,000
<30-2,BECKETT>收拾了他老公
<30-2,BECKETT>Puts a cap in her husband's ass.

784
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,300
<30-3,BECKETT>所以世界是公平的
<30-3,BECKETT>So all is right with the world.

785
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,500
<30-3,BECKETT>我要去和梅勒妮的父母谈谈
<30-3,BECKETT>I'm gonna go talk to Melanie's parents,

786
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,100
<30-3,BECKETT>告诉他们都是怎么回事
<30-3,BECKETT>Let 'em know how this all shook out.

787
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
<31-4,CASTLE>你要来吗
<31-4,CASTLE>You wanna come?

788
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
<30-4,CASTLE>那个收到冷藏柜的老太太
<30-4,CASTLE>The woman with the freezer delivery

789
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,000
<30-4,CASTLE>说她和一个警察谈过
<30-4,CASTLE>Told us she talked to a cop.

790
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
<30-5,BECKETT>对  斯隆
<30-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Sloan.

791
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
<30-6,CASTLE>但他的报告里没写她的名字
<30-6,CASTLE>Only he didn't list her name in his report.

792
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,700
<30-7,BECKETT>他觉得不重要吧
<30-7,BECKETT>He didn't feel that it was important.

793
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,000
<30-7,BECKETT>毕竟他不信那是一起谋杀案
<30-7,BECKETT>After all, he didn't believe he was looking at a murder.

794
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,900
<30-8,CASTLE>那如果  你不是在调查谋杀案
<30-8,CASTLE>Right, so if you're not investigating a murder,

795
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,610
<30-8,CASTLE>为什么会询问邻居
<30-8,CASTLE>Why would you talk to the neighbor

796
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,900
<30-8,CASTLE>送冷藏柜的事情
<30-8,CASTLE>About a freezer delivery?

797
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,600
<31-1,DELORIS>肯定是冷藏柜的事
<31-1,DELORIS>This must be some freezer.

798
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,600
<31-2,BECKETT>马什太太您提起过一个警察
<31-2,BECKETT>You mentioned a police officer, Mrs. Marsh.

799
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,370
<31-2,BECKETT>我知道已经五年了  但您
<31-2,BECKETT>I know it's been five years, but do you

800
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,600
<31-3,DELORIS>我可没说过是五年前
<31-3,DELORIS>I never said five years ago.

801
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,300
<31-4,CASTLE>-他什么时候找的您  -去年
<31-4,CASTLE>- When did he come see you? - Last year sometime.

802
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,000
<31-5,DELORIS>我记得想过  为什么警察问我这些
<31-5,DELORIS>I remember thinking, why is this cop asking me questions

803
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,800
<31-5,DELORIS>只是关于我从没订过的冷藏柜
<31-5,DELORIS>About a freezer I never ordered?

804
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,900
<31-6,BECKETT>您还记得来找您的
<31-6,BECKETT>Do you remember anything about

805
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,300
<31-6,BECKETT>那个人的情况吗
<31-6,BECKETT>The man who came to see you?

806
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,800
<31-7,DELORIS>他年纪也大了
<31-7,DELORIS>Uh, he was older.

807
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,400
<31-8,BECKETT>穿制服吗
<31-8,BECKETT>Uniform?

808
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
<31-9,DELORIS>不  和你们一样是便服
<31-9,DELORIS>No. Plain clothes like you.

809
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,300
<31-9,DELORIS>灰白发  走路有点跛
<31-9,DELORIS>He had gray hair, and he walked with a limp.

810
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,000
<31-10,CASTLE>-本·戴维逊  -梅勒妮的父亲
<31-10,CASTLE>- Ben Davidson. - Melanie's dad.

811
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,500
<32-1,CASTLE>你可以什么也不做
<32-1,CASTLE>You could just leave it like this.

812
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
<32-1,CASTLE>山姆死了
<32-1,CASTLE>Sam's dead.

813
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,200
<32-1,CASTLE>老大很高兴
<32-1,CASTLE>The captain's happy.

814
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,900
<32-1,CASTLE>孩子们看起来也很快乐
<32-1,CASTLE>Those kids look pretty happy.

815
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,790
<32-2,BECKETT>这就是小说
<32-2,BECKETT>That's the difference between a novel

816
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,900
<32-2,BECKETT>和现实的不同  卡塞尔
<32-2,BECKETT>And the real world, Castle.

817
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,800
<32-2,BECKETT>警察不能决定故事怎样结束
<32-2,BECKETT>A cop doesn't get to decide how the story ends.

818
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,200
<32-3,BEN DAVIDSON>贝克特探长
<32-3,BEN DAVIDSON>Detective Beckett.

819
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,600
<32-4,BECKETT>先生  您得和我
<32-4,BECKETT>Sir, I'm gonna have to take you

820
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,700
<32-4,BECKETT>去警局一趟
<32-4,BECKETT>With me down to the station.

821
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,500
<32-5,JULIE DAVIDSON>亲爱的  是谁
<32-5,JULIE DAVIDSON>Who is it, honey?

822
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,600
<32-6,JULIE DAVIDSON>本  怎么了
<32-6,JULIE DAVIDSON>What is it, Ben?

823
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
<33-1,BEN DAVIDSON>我来这儿就是因为
<33-1,BEN DAVIDSON>So I'm here because

824
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,900
<33-1,BEN DAVIDSON>我问别人  有关冷藏柜的问题
<33-1,BEN DAVIDSON>I questioned a woman about a freezer?

825
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,700
<33-2,CASTLE>可不是一般的冷藏柜  戴维逊先生
<33-2,CASTLE>Not any freezer, Mr. Davidson.

826
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,800
<33-2,CASTLE>是藏匿您女儿尸体的冷藏柜
<33-2,CASTLE>The freezer that your daughter's body was stored in.

827
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,800
<33-3,BEN DAVIDSON>暂且  我们
<33-3,BEN DAVIDSON>For the moment, let's--

828
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
<33-3,BEN DAVIDSON>我们假设你说的是真的
<33-3,BEN DAVIDSON>Let's assume what you say is true.

829
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,500
<33-3,BEN DAVIDSON>会以什么罪起诉
<33-3,BEN DAVIDSON>What's the charge?

830
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,200
<33-4,BECKETT>如果马什太太的回答造成山姆的死
<33-4,BECKETT>If Mrs. Marsh's answer led to Sam's death,

831
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,800
<33-4,BECKETT>会以谋杀起诉
<33-4,BECKETT>Then the charge would be murder.

832
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,900
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>我一直在想山姆说的每件事
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>I kept going over everything Sam said,

833
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,000
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>他说的  那晚的一切
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>Everything he claimed happened that night,

834
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,820
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>直到得出一个结论
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>Until I came to the same conclusion

835
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,400
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>显然和你们的结论一样
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>That you both apparently did

836
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,500
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>梅勒妮根本没有活着离开过家
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>That Melanie never left her apartment alive.

837
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,200
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>马什太太的回答只确认了
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>Mrs. Marsh's answers merely confirmed

838
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,300
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>我已经知道的东西
<33-5,BEN DAVIDSON>What I already knew.

839
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,100
<33-6,BECKETT>你的女婿就是凶手
<33-6,BECKETT>That your son-in-law was a killer.

840
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
<33-7,CASTLE>如果已经猜出山姆做了什么
<33-7,CASTLE>If you had figured out what Sam had done,

841
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,400
<33-7,CASTLE>你为什么不报警
<33-7,CASTLE>Why not just go to the police?

842
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,000
<33-7,CASTLE>他会在监狱度过余生
<33-7,CASTLE>He would've gone to prison for the rest of his life.

843
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,900
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>是假如他被判有罪的话
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>If he'd been convicted.

844
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,200
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>但他们那时候没有尸体  记得吗
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>They didn't have a-a body at the time, remember?

845
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,700
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>他的律师会摆让梅勒妮受审  不是他
<33-8,BEN DAVIDSON>His lawyers would've put Melanie on trial, not him.

846
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,200
<33-9,BECKETT>所以你就自己动手了
<33-9,BECKETT>So you took matters into your own hands.

847
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,940
<33-9,BECKETT>你确实理解了
<33-9,BECKETT>Well, you can certainly understand

848
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,300
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>一个父亲的想法
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>How a father might want to,

849
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,900
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>他可能跟踪杀害他女儿的凶手
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>How he might follow his daughter's murderer

850
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,300
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>趁着漆黑的夜晚
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>One dark night when he was sure

851
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>他确信周围没人的时候
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>No other people would be around,

852
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,300
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>他可能是用从战争时期
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>How he might confront him with a gun

853
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,500
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>带回的枪指着他
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>He'd brought back from the war,

854
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,800
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>甚至同意用宽恕换取真相
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>Might even promise forgiveness in exchange for the truth.

855
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,100
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>听他承认罪行
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>And hearing his admission...

856
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,200
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>却又被愤怒压倒
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>Be overcome with rage.

857
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,600
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>每一次  他带孩子们来看我们
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>Every time he brought the girls to see us,

858
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,900
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>我都看到  我妻子的心又死去了一些
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>I watched a little piece of my wife die.

859
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,200
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>孙辈们的看望  应该使人感到生命可贵
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>A visit from your grandkids should be life-affirming,

860
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,400
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>不是提醒你  唯一的女儿是怎样被杀害的
<33-10,BEN DAVIDSON>Not a reminder of how your only child was murdered.

861
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,100
<33-11,BECKETT>杀了他并不是解决办法
<33-11,BECKETT>Killing him wasn't the answer.

862
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,600
<33-11,BECKETT>我从来没说我杀了他
<33-11,BECKETT>I never said I killed him.

863
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,800
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>我说的是  一个父亲可能有正当理由的
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>I said a father might be justified.

864
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>警察告诉我山姆是被劫杀的
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>The police told me Sam was shot in a robbery,

865
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>没有证据的话
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>And without evidence, there'd be little chance

866
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,700
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>几乎不可能抓到凶手
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>That his killer would ever be brought to justice.

867
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,900
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>所以我想  以后会知道是否如他所言
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>So I guess we'll find out if that's really true.

868
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,200
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>如果可以的话  我想要见律师
<33-12,BEN DAVIDSON>And I'd like to see a-a lawyer if I could.

869
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
<34-1,CASTLE>不  甜心
<34-1,CASTLE>No, sweetie,

870
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
<34-1,CASTLE>我只是想和你说晚安
<34-1,CASTLE>I just wanted to make sure I said good night.

871
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,900
<34-1,CASTLE>好  我请吃草莓笑脸煎饼
<34-1,CASTLE>You got it. Strawberry happy face pancakes on me.

872
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,100
<34-1,CASTLE>再见
<34-1,CASTLE>Later.

873
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,400
<34-2,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯想我了
<34-2,CASTLE>Alexis missed me.

874
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,500
<34-3,BECKETT>你怎么知道
<34-3,BECKETT>How did you know?

875
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,500
<34-4,CASTLE>蜘蛛人的第六感
<34-4,CASTLE>Spidey sense.

876
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,700
<34-5,BECKETT>顺便说下  是我母亲
<34-5,BECKETT>By the way, it was my mother,

877
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,500
<34-5,BECKETT>不是父亲
<34-5,BECKETT>Not my father.

878
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,700
<34-6,BECKETT>我们本应一起去吃晚餐
<34-6,BECKETT>We were supposed to go to dinner together--

879
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,100
<34-6,BECKETT>我妈妈  爸爸和我
<34-6,BECKETT>My mom, my dad and I

880
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,600
<34-6,BECKETT>她该在餐馆和我们碰头
<34-6,BECKETT>And she was gonna meet us at the restaurant,

881
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,100
<34-6,BECKETT>但她没来
<34-6,BECKETT>But she never showed.

882
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,300
<34-6,BECKETT>两个小时后  我们回了家
<34-6,BECKETT>Two hours later, we went home.

883
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,800
<34-6,BECKETT>有个警官在等我们
<34-6,BECKETT>And there was a detective waiting for us.

884
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,500
<34-6,BECKETT>拉格林警官
<34-6,BECKETT>Detective Raglin.

885
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,600
<34-6,BECKETT>他们发现了她的尸体
<34-6,BECKETT>They found her body.

886
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,900
<34-6,BECKETT>她被人捅了
<34-6,BECKETT>She had been stabbed.

887
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,600
<34-7,CASTLE>抢劫吗
<34-7,CASTLE>A robbery?

888
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,700
<34-7,CASTLE>不
<34-7,CASTLE>No.

889
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,500
<34-8,BECKETT>她的钱  包和首饰都还在
<34-8,BECKETT>She still had her money and purse and jewelry.

890
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
<34-8,BECKETT>也没有性侵犯
<34-8,BECKETT>And it wasn't a sexual assault, either.

891
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,900
<34-8,BECKETT>他们归因于帮派暴力
<34-8,BECKETT>They attributed it to gang violence.

892
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,400
<34-8,BECKETT>随机事件
<34-8,BECKETT>Random wayward event.

893
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,100
<34-8,BECKETT>所以正像梅勒妮的案件
<34-8,BECKETT>So just like in Melanie's case,

894
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,300
<34-8,BECKETT>他们不能换个角度考虑
<34-8,BECKETT>They couldn't think outside the box.

895
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,700
<34-8,BECKETT>所以他们只是编了个不错的故事
<34-8,BECKETT>So they just tried to package it up nicely,

896
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,800
<34-8,BECKETT>根本没抓到凶手
<34-8,BECKETT>And the killer was never caught.

897
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,300
<34-9,CASTLE>你为什么戴那个表
<34-9,CASTLE>Why do you wear the watch?

898
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,900
<34-10,BECKETT>她的离开对我爸爸的打击非常大
<34-10,BECKETT>My dad took her death hard.

899
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,100
<34-10,BECKETT>他现在清醒了
<34-10,BECKETT>He's sober now.

900
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,500
<34-10,BECKETT>五年了
<34-10,BECKETT>Five years.

901
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,800
<34-11,BECKETT>所以
<34-11,BECKETT>So...

902
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,900
<34-11,BECKETT>这是为我挽救了的生命
<34-11,BECKETT>This is for the life that I saved,

903
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,200
<34-11,BECKETT>以及
<34-11,BECKETT>And...

904
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,900
<34-11,BECKETT>这是为我失去了的生命
<34-11,BECKETT>This is for the life that I lost.

905
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,100
<34-11,BECKETT>所以
<34-11,BECKETT>So...

906
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,380
<34-12,BECKETT>我猜你的妮奇·希特现在
<34-12,BECKETT>I guess your Nikki Heat has

907
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,300
<34-12,BECKETT>有背景故事了  卡塞尔
<34-12,BECKETT>A backstory now, Castle.

908
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,500
<34-12,BECKETT>我不知道
<34-12,BECKETT>I don't know.

909
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,200
<34-13,CASTLE>我确实喜欢白天妓女  晚上警察这点
<34-13,CASTLE>I did kinda like the hooker-by-day, cop-by-night thing.

910
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,400
<34-13,CASTLE>但是
<34-13,CASTLE>But, uh...

911
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,200
<34-13,CASTLE>我猜深情这个角度也行
<34-13,CASTLE>I guess a heavy emotional angle could work, too.

912
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,870
<34-14,BECKETT>别说是为了我
<34-14,BECKETT>Don't bewilder your audiences

913
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,300
<34-14,BECKETT>把你的读者弄糊涂了  卡塞尔
<34-14,BECKETT>With substance on my account, Castle.

914
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,500

<34-15,CASTLE>Until tomorrow, detective.

915
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,700
<34-16,BECKETT>你就不能说晚安吗
<34-16,BECKETT>You can't just say "night"?

916
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,100
<34-17,CASTLE>我是个作家  晚安这个词太无聊
<34-17,CASTLE>I'm a writer. "night" is boring.

917
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,200
<34-17,CASTLE>明天见  更充满希望
<34-17,CASTLE>" Until tomorrow" is more... Hopeful.

918
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,500
<34-18,BECKETT>我是个警察
<34-18,BECKETT>I'm a cop.

919
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,900
<34-19,CASTLE>晚安
<34-19,CASTLE>Night.

920
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,500
<34-19,CASTLE>晚安
<34-19,CASTLE>Night.

921
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,700
<35-1,BECKETT>爸爸
<35-1,BECKETT>Hi, dad.

<35-1,BECKETT>记住  这从来没发生过
<35-1,BECKETT>Remember, this never happened.

<36-1,ESPOSITO>我从来没来过这儿
<36-1,ESPOSITO>I was never here.

924
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,300
<36-2,CASTLE>我保证
<36-2,CASTLE>You have my word.

925
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,800
<36-2,CASTLE>谢谢
<36-2,CASTLE>Thanks.

926
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,200
<36-3,ESPOSITO>如果你告诉她是我干的
<36-3,ESPOSITO>If you tell her I did this,

927
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,100
<36-3,ESPOSITO>我会让你血溅当场
<36-3,ESPOSITO>I will make you bleed.
