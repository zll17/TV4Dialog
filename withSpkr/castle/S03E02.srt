00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,310
<1-1,PENNY>妈妈
<1-1,PENNY>Mom.

20

<1-1,PENNY>妈妈

21
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,890
<1-1,PENNY>妈  你在吗
<1-1,PENNY>Mom, are you here?

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,070
<1-1,PENNY>不要啊

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,260
<1-2,PENNY>快点  妈妈  接电话
<1-2,PENNY>Come on, mom. Answer.

<1-2,PENNY>你们好
<1-2,PENNY>Oh, hello.

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,850
<2-1,MARTHA>你不是应该上学去了吗
<2-1,MARTHA>Shouldn't you be in school already?

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,050
<2-2,ALEXIS>还有一个小时才上课呢
<2-2,ALEXIS>School doesn't start for another hour.

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,370
<2-3,CASTLE>是啊  如果你出去过夜
<2-3,CASTLE>Yeah. If you were hoping to do

28
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,230
<2-3,CASTLE>想一个人偷偷溜回来
<2-3,CASTLE>the walk of shame in private,

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,930
<2-3,CASTLE>真是不走运
<2-3,CASTLE>You're outta luck.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,290
<2-4,MARTHA>别犯傻
<2-4,MARTHA>Oh, don't be silly.

31
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,430
<2-4,MARTHA>我只是没想到时间还早
<2-4,MARTHA>I just didn't realize how early it was.

32
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,600
<2-4,MARTHA>我被其他的东西搞得心神不宁
<2-4,MARTHA>I have been a bit distracted this morning.

33
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,620
<2-4,MARTHA>心神不宁
<2-4,MARTHA>Do you mean distracted,

34
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,930
<2-5,CASTLE>还是你被手指上这枚超大的钻戒
<2-5,CASTLE>or hypnotized by that giant rock

35
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,990
<2-5,CASTLE>闪晕了
<2-5,CASTLE>on your finger?!

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,160
<2-6,ALEXIS>天啊  切特·帕拉本求婚了
<2-6,ALEXIS>Wow. Did Chet Palaburn propose?

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,570
<2-7,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  我想我们要管他叫
<2-7,CASTLE>Uh, Alexis, I think it's about time we start

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,210
<2-7,CASTLE>切特叔叔才比较得体
<2-7,CASTLE>calling him Uncle Chet.

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,540
<2-8,MARTHA>等等  你们两个等一下
<2-8,MARTHA>Oh, now wait a minute. Wait a minute, you two.

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,960
<2-8,MARTHA>我没订婚  好吧
<2-8,MARTHA>I am not engaged, all right?

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,870
<2-8,MARTHA>没错  切特昨晚的确求婚了
<2-8,MARTHA>Yes, Chet did propose last night

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,330
<2-8,MARTHA>我告诉他我需要考虑考虑
<2-8,MARTHA>and I told him, you know, I needed time to think about it,

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,330
<2-8,MARTHA>他坚持让我
<2-8,MARTHA>And he insisted I keep

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,330
<2-8,MARTHA>在考虑的时候留着戒指
<2-8,MARTHA>the ring while I make up my mind, so...

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,620
<2-9,CASTLE>真是个聪明的男人
<2-9,CASTLE>Mm. Smart man. Mm.

46
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,860
<2-9,CASTLE>钻石很有说服力的
<2-9,CASTLE>Diamonds can be very persuasive.

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,050
<2-9,CASTLE>我都听得到它的低吟"留下我  留下我"
<2-9,CASTLE>I can hear it now, whispering... "Keep me. Keep me."

48
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,880
<2-10,MARTHA>坏消息是  用"道上的说法"
<2-10,MARTHA>Unfortunately, now that Chet has upped the ante,

49
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,250
<2-10,MARTHA>现在切特提高了赌注  我要决定
<2-10,MARTHA>as they say, I'm going to have to decide

50
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,420
<2-10,MARTHA>我是跟注还是扣牌了
<2-10,MARTHA>whether I'm in or I'm out.

51
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,340
<2-11,ALEXIS>我以为你是爱切特的
<2-11,ALEXIS>I thought you loved Chet.

52
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,860
<2-12,MARTHA>我的确爱他  亲爱的  但是我...
<2-12,MARTHA>Oh, I do love him, darling. I really do. I j--I...

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,550
<2-12,MARTHA>知道吗  对我来说...
<2-12,MARTHA>Well, you know, it's just that for me, it's, uh--

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
<2-13,CASTLE>激情不再了
<2-13,CASTLE>The thrill is gone.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,280
<2-13,CASTLE>正是
<2-13,CASTLE>Yes,

56
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,940
<2-14,MARTHA>已经不再好久好久了
<2-14,MARTHA>and it's been gone for quite a while.

57
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,860
<2-14,MARTHA>不过这大钻戒都是把激情带回来了
<2-14,MARTHA>Although this little fella did bring it back

58
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,940
<2-14,MARTHA>维持了10分钟
<2-14,MARTHA>for about ten minutes.

59
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,430
<2-15,ALEXIS>如果他不是你的挚爱  我想
<2-15,ALEXIS>If he's not the one, then I guess you

60
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,460
<2-15,ALEXIS>你不应该嫁给他
<2-15,ALEXIS>shouldn't marry him.

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,540
<2-16,CASTLE>以前这种情况她都嫁了
<2-16,CASTLE>That's never stopped her before.

62
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,420
<2-17,ALEXIS>再说我们都很想念你
<2-17,ALEXIS>And we miss having you here all the time.

63
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,600
<2-17,ALEXIS>是吧  老爸
<2-17,ALEXIS>Don't we, dad?

64
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,160
<2-18,ALEXIS_MARTHA>-老爸  -儿子
<2-18,ALEXIS_MARTHA>- Dad?  -Dad?

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,990
<2-19,MARTHA>幸亏手机铃响了
<2-19,MARTHA>Saved by the bell.

66
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,130
<2-20,CASTLE>是贝克特  我是卡塞尔
<2-20,CASTLE>Ah, it's Beckett. Castle.

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,480
<3-1,CASTLE>我没听错吧
<3-1,CASTLE>Hey, did I hear you right?

68
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,780
<3-1,CASTLE>被害人是薇薇安·马查德  那个灵媒
<3-1,CASTLE>Our victim is Vivien Marchand, the psychic medium?

69
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,070
<3-2,KEVIN RYAN>你听说过
<3-2,KEVIN RYAN>You've heard of her?

70
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,280
<3-3,CASTLE>当然  她在曼哈顿某些圈子里很出名的
<3-3,CASTLE>Yeah. She was very popular in certain Manhattan circles.

71
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,050
<3-3,CASTLE>事实上  8年前在一个社交派对上
<3-3,CASTLE>Huh. Matter of fact, she did a reading for me

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,600
<3-3,CASTLE>给我算过一卦
<3-3,CASTLE>at a society party about eight years ago.

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,960
<3-3,CASTLE>相当邪乎
<3-3,CASTLE>It was pretty extraordinary.

74
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,340
<3-4,KATE BECKETT>"邪乎"
<3-4,KATE BECKETT>"Extraordinary"?

75
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,880
<3-5,CASTLE>每件事都被她说对了
<3-5,CASTLE>She got everything right.

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,790
<3-5,CASTLE>知道吗  回想起来
<3-5,CASTLE>You know what? Come to think of it,

77
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,090
<3-5,CASTLE>她告诉我一位美丽的女士
<3-5,CASTLE>she told me that a beautiful woman

78
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,460
<3-5,CASTLE>会住进我的公寓  住进来就不走了
<3-5,CASTLE>would one day move into my loft and stay with me forever.

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,100
<3-5,CASTLE>她没说那女的是我母亲
<3-5,CASTLE>She neglected to mention it was my mother.

80
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,360
<3-5,CASTLE>她怎么死的
<3-5,CASTLE>How did she die?

81
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,540
<3-6,LANIE PARISH>被人用冰锥刺中后颈
<3-6,LANIE PARISH>Stabbed in the back of the neck with an ice pick,

82
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,990
<3-6,LANIE PARISH>之后被塞进沙发
<3-6,LANIE PARISH>and then stuffed into the sofa.

83
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,560
<3-7,CASTLE>这么说她没预料到这件事
<3-7,CASTLE>So she didn't see that coming.

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,180
<3-8,BECKETT>死亡时间呢
<3-8,BECKETT>When did she die?

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
<3-9,LANIE>尸体完全僵硬  我推断大致死亡时间
<3-9,LANIE>She's in full rigor. I'd say yesterday afternoon

86
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,620
<3-9,LANIE>是昨天下午
<3-9,LANIE>is the approximate time of death.

87
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,910
<3-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>有个维修工说他看到
<3-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I got a maintenance worker said

88
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,630
<3-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>一位男子在下午2点半左右
<3-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>he saw a man leaving the back door

89
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,940
<3-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>从后门离开薇薇安的办公室
<3-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>of Vivien's office around 2:30 yesterday afternoon.

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,340
<3-12,ESPOSITO>-看到长相了吗  -高个白人  长相凶悍
<3-12,ESPOSITO>- Description? - Tall, caucasian and tough looking.

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,880
<3-13,BECKETT>莱恩去查查薇薇安的日程表
<3-13,BECKETT>All right, Ryan, check Vivien's calendar,

92
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,820
<3-13,BECKETT>我们看看她昨天的客户
<3-13,BECKETT>and let's interview her clients from yesterday.

93
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,020
<3-13,BECKETT>也许凶手就在其中
<3-13,BECKETT>Maybe one of them saw the guy.

94
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,500
<3-14,RYAN>我没搞明白  为什么把她塞进沙发
<3-14,RYAN>What I don't get is, why put her in the couch?

95
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,640
<3-15,LANIE>被塞进去的时候  她还活着
<3-15,LANIE>She was alive when she went in.

96
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,200
<3-15,LANIE>脸上的刮痕表明
<3-15,LANIE>These scratches on her face

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,660
<3-15,LANIE>她试图想要爬出来
<3-15,LANIE>indicate that she tried to move.

98
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,360
<3-15,LANIE>我把她带回解剖室
<3-15,LANIE>I'm gonna get her back the lab.

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,010
<4-1,RYAN>昨天下午3点  她日程表上有个标记
<4-1,RYAN>She's got a notation here for 3:00 p.m. Yesterday.

100
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,810
<4-1,RYAN>上面写的是TJ
<4-1,RYAN>It just says "T.J."

101
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,080
<4-2,BECKETT>没别的了
<4-2,BECKETT>And nothing else?

102
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,320
<4-3,RYAN>没了  也许TJ是个拜访她的鬼魂
<4-3,RYAN>Nope. Maybe T.J. Was a ghost coming to visit.

103
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,100
<4-3,RYAN>灵媒不都能看到鬼魂这类的吗
<4-3,RYAN>Mediums are the ones that can see ghosts,

104
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,150
<4-4,CASTLE>-是吧  卡塞尔  -是的  通灵的人能预见未来
<4-4,CASTLE>- right, castle? - Yes, psychics can tell the future.

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,580
<4-4,CASTLE>灵媒能预知未来也能与灵魂对话
<4-4,CASTLE>Mediums can tell the future and talk to the dead.

106
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,990
<4-5,BECKETT>说得好像把通灵师比作骗子
<4-5,BECKETT>That's like saying that psychics are con artists,

107
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,820
<4-5,BECKETT>灵媒就是骗子外加大话王
<4-5,BECKETT>and mediums are con artists and charlatans.

108
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,320
<4-5,BECKETT>说到底  他们都是假把式
<4-5,BECKETT>I mean, in the end, they're all just fakes.

109
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,350
<4-6,CASTLE>说得好像你很明白的样子
<4-6,CASTLE>You sound pretty certain of yourself.

110
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,090
<4-7,BECKETT>那是因为我开始做警察的时候
<4-7,BECKETT>That's because when I started as a cop,

111
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,380
<4-7,BECKETT>浪费了太多时间追查通天眼的人提供的线报
<4-7,BECKETT>I wasted a lot of time on clairvoyants calling tip lines

112
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,970
<4-7,BECKETT>到头来没一个是有价值的线索
<4-7,BECKETT>with information that never led to anything.

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,030
<4-7,BECKETT>我没想到你这么容易上当
<4-7,BECKETT>I mean, I'm surprised you're so gullible.

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,590
<4-8,CASTLE>我又没说我能和灵魂交谈
<4-8,CASTLE>I'm not saying I can speak with the dead.

115
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,840
<4-8,CASTLE>我也是说我相信世界上有些人
<4-8,CASTLE>I'm just willing to admit that there are people in this world

116
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,480
<4-8,CASTLE>比我有更强的感知力
<4-8,CASTLE>who are more sensitive than me.

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,920
<4-9,BECKETT>这个我信[sensitve有感知力和体贴两个意思]
<4-9,BECKETT>Now that's not hard to believe.

118
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,860
<4-10,CASTLE>我自取其辱了  是吧
<4-10,CASTLE>Walked right into that one.

119
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,020
<5-1,BECKETT>马查德小姐  你知道有什么人
<5-1,BECKETT>Ms. Marchand, do you know of anyone

120
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,540
<5-1,BECKETT>有可能想要伤害你的母亲吗
<5-1,BECKETT>that might have wanted to harm your mother?

121
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,970
<5-2,PENNY>她是一个灵魂纯粹的人
<5-2,PENNY>She was a very spiritual person.

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,610
<5-2,PENNY>她没有什么敌人
<5-2,PENNY>She didn't have any enemies.

123
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,010
<5-3,BECKETT>有证人看到一个高大  头发深色的男子
<5-3,BECKETT>A witness saw a tall, dark-haired man

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
<5-3,BECKETT>昨天2点半从这离开
<5-3,BECKETT>leaving here around 2:30 yesterday.

125
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,050
<5-3,BECKETT>听起来像是你母亲认识的人吗
<5-3,BECKETT>Does that sound like anyone your mother knows?

126
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,600
<5-4,BECKETT>你上次和她说话是什么时候
<5-4,BECKETT>When was the last time you two talked?

127
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,060
<5-4,BECKETT>大概1点钟
<5-4,BECKETT>Around 1:00.

128
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,740
<5-5,PENNY>她说她与今天最后一个客户见过面
<5-5,PENNY>She said she had her last client of the day,

129
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,210
<5-5,PENNY>她说今天下午
<5-5,PENNY>And then she was gonna spend

130
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,600
<5-5,PENNY>她想用来冥想
<5-5,PENNY>the afternoon in meditation.

131
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,990
<5-6,BECKETT>知道客户的名字吗
<5-6,BECKETT>Do you know the client's name?

132
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,740
<5-7,PENNY>不知道  是一对母女
<5-7,PENNY>No. It was a mother and a daughter.

133
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,560
<5-7,PENNY>她们的名字应该在她的记事薄上

<11-7,MORENO>当我生气的时候  别人都会很紧张
<11-7,MORENO>And when I'm mad, sometimes people get nervous.

250
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,940
<11-7,MORENO>她求我让我等待宇宙裁决一切命数
<11-7,MORENO>She begged me to let the universe sort itself out,

251
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,400
<11-7,MORENO>还说她后面还有一个
<11-7,MORENO>and she said she was late

252
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,120
<11-8,BECKETT>在市中心的预约要迟到了
<11-8,BECKETT>for an appointment uptown.

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,390
<11-8,BECKETT>她说和谁有约了吗
<11-8,BECKETT>Did she say with whom?

254
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,210
<11-9,MORENO>没有  那时  我见经纪人也要迟到了
<11-9,MORENO>No. By then, I was late to meet my broker,

255
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,820
<11-9,MORENO>我就走了  时间是2点半左右
<11-9,MORENO>So I left, about 2:30.

256
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,950
<11-9,MORENO>就这样
<11-9,MORENO>And just like that...

257
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,830
<12-2,BECKETT>宇宙
<12-2,BECKETT>The universe?

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,450
<11-9,MORENO>确实自有定夺
<11-9,MORENO>It sorted itself out.

259
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
<11-10,BECKETT>抱歉  我没听懂
<11-10,BECKETT>I'm--I'm sorry. I don't understand.

260
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,460
<11-11,MORENO>我发现我经纪人的搭档
<11-11,MORENO>Turns out, my, uh, broker's partner

261
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,590
<11-11,MORENO>就是劳瑞  我高中时候的女友
<11-11,MORENO>is, uh, Loreen here, my high school sweetheart.

262
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,750
<11-12,LOREEN>我们82年分手
<11-12,LOREEN>We broke up in '82,

263
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,490
<11-12,LOREEN>但是我们还没有忘记对方
<11-12,LOREEN>but we never got over each other.

264
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,700
<11-13,MORENO>我再见到她的第一眼起
<11-13,MORENO>The minute I laid eyes on her again,

265
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,700
<11-13,MORENO>我就没再离开过
<11-13,MORENO>I haven't left her side,

266
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,240
<11-13,MORENO>我也从未如此快乐
<11-13,MORENO>and I never been so happy.

267
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,170
<11-14,CASTLE>这么说  薇薇安说对了
<11-14,CASTLE>So... Vivien was right.

268
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,180
<11-14,CASTLE>投资房地产
<11-14,CASTLE>Investing in the real estate deal

269
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,740
<11-14,CASTLE>使你破产
<11-14,CASTLE>brought you to bankruptcy,

270
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,250
<11-14,CASTLE>却让你找到了劳瑞
<11-14,CASTLE>which, in turn, brought you to Loreen

271
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,020
<11-14,CASTLE>和幸福
<11-14,CASTLE>and true happiness.

272
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,990
<11-14,CASTLE>邪乎
<11-14,CASTLE>Extraordinary.

273
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,230
<12-1,CASTLE>感觉如何
<12-1,CASTLE>So what do you think?

274
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,520
<12-2,BECKETT>我想在宇宙解决事情之前
<12-2,BECKETT>Well, I think it's possible he might have killed Vivien

275
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,740
<12-2,BECKETT>他可能已经杀了薇薇安
<12-2,BECKETT>before the universe righted itself.

276
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,540
<12-3,CASTLE>不是这个  而是艾伯特和劳瑞
<12-3,CASTLE>Not about that. About them--Albert and Loreen.

277
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,200
<12-3,CASTLE>擦肩而过的爱人因命运而重聚
<12-3,CASTLE>Star-crossed lovers reunited by fate.

278
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,070
<12-4,BECKETT>你是说纯属巧合而重聚吧
<12-4,BECKETT>You mean reunited by coincidence.

279
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,230
<12-5,CASTLE>让我猜猜  你不相信命运
<12-5,CASTLE>Oh, let me guess. You don't believe in fate.

280
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,770
<12-5,CASTLE>灵魂伴侣呢
<12-5,CASTLE>Soul mates?

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,500
<12-6,BECKETT>不信
<12-6,BECKETT>No.

282
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,060
<12-7,CASTLE>独角兽  小精灵  双重彩虹呢
<12-7,CASTLE>Unicorns, fairies, double rainbows?

283
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,620
<12-7,CASTLE>你有想过你的公仔们会在晚上起来
<12-7,CASTLE>Didn't you ever think your dolls used to get up at night

284
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,900
<12-7,CASTLE>-摆弄你的玩具么  -抱歉  没有
<12-7,CASTLE>- and play with your toys?  - Sorry.

285
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,050
<12-8,BECKETT>让我猜猜
<12-8,BECKETT>Mm. Let me guess.

286
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,880
<12-9,CASTLE>你是那些讨人烦的小孩
<12-9,CASTLE>You were one of those annoying 6 year olds

287
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,250
<12-9,CASTLE>6岁时就不相信圣诞老人
<12-9,CASTLE>who stopped believing in Santa Claus

288
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,400
<12-9,CASTLE>因为你知道了
<12-9,CASTLE>because you figured out he couldn't travel

289
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,890
<12-9,CASTLE>他的速度不可能快过光速
<12-9,CASTLE>faster than the speed of light.

290
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,120
<12-10,BECKETT>我三岁就不信了  而且我们家没有烟囱
<12-10,BECKETT>I was 3, and we didn't have a chimney.

291
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,730
<13-1,ESPOSITO>莫雷诺那进展如何
<13-1,ESPOSITO>How'd it go with Moreno?

292
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,440
<13-2,BECKETT>我的直觉不是他
<13-2,BECKETT>My gut says it's not him.

293
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,330
<13-2,BECKETT>但我们还得调查他的不在场证明
<13-2,BECKETT>But we still have to look into his alibi.

294
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,070
<13-3,CASTLE>虽然你不相信命运
<13-3,CASTLE>Oh, so you don't believe in fate,

295
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,000
<13-3,CASTLE>但你的直觉真有魔力
<13-3,CASTLE>yet your "Gut" Has magical properties.

296
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,040
<13-3,CASTLE>太酷了  斯嘉丽[《X档案》女主角]
<13-3,CASTLE>That's cool, Scully.

297
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,740
<13-4,RYAN>我们申请了薇薇安大多数有案底的客户资料
<13-4,RYAN>We got calls out on most of Vivien's dirty dozen.

298
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,700
<13-4,RYAN>明天应该会有报告
<13-4,RYAN>We should hear back tomorrow.

299
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,840
<13-4,RYAN>同时  我们调查了她的客户档案
<13-4,RYAN>Meanwhile, we've been going through her client files--

300
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,900
<13-4,RYAN>大厅的来访纪录  网络搜索记录
<13-4,RYAN>trips to the hall of records, Internet searches,

301
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,530
<13-4,RYAN>还拿到一些验尸报告
<13-4,RYAN>even got ahold of some autopsy files.

302
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,740
<13-4,RYAN>非常详尽的资料
<13-4,RYAN>Pretty intimate stuff, too.

303
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,150
<13-5,BECKETT>瞧  卡塞尔
<13-5,BECKETT>You see, Castle?

304
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,890
<13-5,BECKETT>调查研究  这才是她让人相信
<13-5,BECKETT>Research--that's how she made people believe

305
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,390
<13-5,BECKETT>她确有天赋的原因
<13-5,BECKETT>that she has a gift.

306
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,290
<13-5,BECKETT>我打赌她甚至八年前参加派对时
<13-5,BECKETT>And I bet that she even looked into you eight years ago

307
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,730
<13-5,BECKETT>就调查过你
<13-5,BECKETT>when she went to that party.

308
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,460
<13-5,BECKETT>我打赌她也调查了宝拉·卡西利亚斯
<13-5,BECKETT>And I bet she looked up Paula Casillas as well.

309
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,850
<13-5,BECKETT>这样她才知道她丈夫埃米利奥
<13-5,BECKETT>That's how she knew that her husband Emilio

310
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,720
<13-5,BECKETT>有维他命生意
<13-5,BECKETT>had a vitamin business.

311
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,000
<13-6,CASTLE>她也是这样才知道
<13-6,CASTLE>Is that also how she knew

312
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,240
<13-6,CASTLE>艾伯特·莫雷诺会在
<13-6,CASTLE>That Albert Moreno would find

313
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,280
<13-6,CASTLE>破产后找到真爱吗
<13-6,CASTLE>true love through bankruptcy?

314
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,320
<13-7,BECKETT>她那是走运
<13-7,BECKETT>She got lucky.

315
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,450
<13-8,CASTLE>也许因为仅凭她一人的力量
<13-8,CASTLE>Oh. Or maybe it's just that she couldn't get

316
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,740
<13-8,CASTLE>难于得到所需的一切
<13-8,CASTLE>everything she needed from her abilities alone

317
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,840
<13-8,CASTLE>因此需要一些额外的调查
<13-8,CASTLE>and needed to do a little extra digging.

318
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,110
<13-8,CASTLE>我虽然文思如泉涌
<13-8,CASTLE>I have a fantastic imagination,

319
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,080
<13-8,CASTLE>但我写作时
<13-8,CASTLE>yet I still do a ton of research

320
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,320
<13-8,CASTLE>还得进行大量研究
<13-8,CASTLE>when I write a book.

321
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,360
<13-9,CASTLE>一堆怀疑主义者
<13-9,CASTLE>Surrounded by skeptics.

322
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,960
<13-10,ESPOSITO>这才叫真正的警察  兄弟
<13-10,ESPOSITO>It's called being a cop, bro.

323
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,220
<14-1,ALEXIS>伟大的神灵啊
<14-1,ALEXIS>oh, great and powerful spirits,

324
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,130
<14-1,ALEXIS>告诉我们  奶奶应该跟切特·帕拉本分手吗
<14-1,ALEXIS>Tell us, should gram break up with Chet Palaburn?

325
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,170
<14-2,MARTHA>这东西肯定坏了
<14-2,MARTHA>Ugh! This thing must be broken.

326
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,680
<14-2,MARTHA>好在我不需要神灵告诉我
<14-2,MARTHA>Well, luckily, I don't need the spirits to tell me

327
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,240
<14-2,MARTHA>何时分手
<14-2,MARTHA>when it's time to say good-bye.

328
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,140
<14-2,MARTHA>再见  我的爱
<14-2,MARTHA>Good-bye, my love.

329
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,810
<14-3,ALEXIS>如果你太轻率了呢
<14-3,ALEXIS>What if you're being too hasty?

330
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,780
<14-3,ALEXIS>恋情需要经营  对吗
<14-3,ALEXIS>Relationships take work, right?

331
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,680
<14-4,MARTHA>不对  爱情不是关于经营  相信我
<14-4,MARTHA>No, no, no, love is not about work. Trust me.

332
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,420
<14-4,MARTHA>是关于激情  化学感应  浪漫
<14-4,MARTHA>It's about passion. It's about chemistry, romance.

333
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,450
<14-5,CASTLE>是关于你的心跳得很快
<14-5,CASTLE>It's about your heart pounding faster

334
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,010
<14-5,CASTLE>因为你迫不及待要见她
<14-5,CASTLE>because you can't wait to see her.

335
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,920
<14-6,ALEXIS>你们能不能回顾一段
<14-6,ALEXIS>Can either of you look back on a relationship

336
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,660
<14-6,ALEXIS>因为激情不再就结束的恋情
<14-6,ALEXIS>that ended because the thrill was gone,

337
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,430
<14-6,ALEXIS>承认也许你太早放弃爱了
<14-6,ALEXIS>and admit that maybe, you gave up on love too soon?

338
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,910
<14-7,ALEXIS>爸  你不是也和前妻复合了么
<14-7,ALEXIS>Dad, you're back with your ex-wife.

339
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,470
<14-8,CASTLE>不  她是对的  和吉娜一起时
<14-8,CASTLE>Ooh. No, she's right. Yeah, with gina.

340
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,680
<14-8,CASTLE>激情早已逝去
<14-8,CASTLE>The thrill was long, long gone.

341
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,750
<14-8,CASTLE>现在激情激烈回归
<14-8,CASTLE>Now... It is back with a vengeance.

342
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
<14-8,CASTLE>当然  随之而来的还有
<14-8,CASTLE>Of course, it brought along its friends,

343
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,610
<14-8,CASTLE>高昂的保养费和购物狂
<14-8,CASTLE>high maintenance and shopaholic.

344
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,830
<14-9,MARTHA>抱歉  亲爱的  很抱歉
<14-9,MARTHA>No, I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

345
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,230
<14-9,MARTHA>但已经结束了
<14-9,MARTHA>But it's just--it's over.

346
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,430
<14-9,MARTHA>我知道
<14-9,MARTHA>I know it.

347
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,530
<14-9,MARTHA>嘿
<14-9,MARTHA>hey.

348
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,830
<15-1,CASTLE>有案底的那帮人调查有何进展吗
<15-1,CASTLE>Any news on the dirty dozen?

349
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,600
<15-2,RYAN>大多数还在坐牢
<15-2,RYAN>Oh, most are still in prison,

350
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,200
<15-2,RYAN>但我们想这条调查方向
<15-2,RYAN>But we're thinking this line of investigation

351
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,820
<15-2,RYAN>可能没有太大进展
<15-2,RYAN>may not get us anywhere.

352
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,810
<15-3,CASTLE>为什么
<15-3,CASTLE>Why not?

353
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
<15-4,RYAN>我给一些主管的探长打了电话
<15-4,RYAN>I called around to a couple of lead detectives,

354
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,900
<15-4,RYAN>想查查薇薇安的介入程度
<15-4,RYAN>just to check out the level of Vivien's involvement.

355
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,150
<15-4,RYAN>他们说从未听说过她
<15-4,RYAN>They say, they've never even heard of her.

356
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,080
<15-5,BECKETT>她夸大了她的介入程度
<15-5,BECKETT>She exaggerated her involvement in these cases

357
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,090
<15-5,BECKETT>以此来建立她的名声
<15-5,BECKETT>in order to build her reputation back up.

358
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,370
<15-6,CASTLE>也许这些警察不想承认
<15-6,CASTLE>Or maybe the cops didn't want to admit

359
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,280
<15-6,CASTLE>他们有灵媒在帮忙
<15-6,CASTLE>that they had... a psychic actually helping them.

360
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,770
<15-6,CASTLE>我是说  怎样的警察会愿意承认
<15-6,CASTLE>I mean, what police detective would willingly acknowledge

361
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,440
<15-6,CASTLE>她那样的外行竟是破案天才
<15-6,CASTLE>that a layperson is as talented at solving crimes as she is?

362
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,540
<15-6,CASTLE>薇薇安·马查德
<15-6,CASTLE>Vivien Marchand...

363
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,970
<15-7,BECKETT>不是灵媒
<15-7,BECKETT>is not a psychic.

364
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,840
<15-7,BECKETT>我以警徽打赌
<15-7,BECKETT>I'd bet my badge on it.

365
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,370
<15-8,ESPOSITO>等你看了这个再下定论吧
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Don't throw those dice until you take a look at this.

366
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,540
<15-9,CASTLE>纽约重案组探长小组收
<15-9,CASTLE>"New york homicide division detective squad."

367
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,850
<15-9,CASTLE>是薇薇安·马查德寄来的
<15-9,CASTLE>It's from Vivien Marchand.

368
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,950
<15-10,ESPOSITO>是的  今早到的
<15-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, it arrived this morning,

369
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,750
<15-10,ESPOSITO>邮戳是星期一  她死的那天
<15-10,ESPOSITO>postmarked Monday, the day she died.

370
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,880
<15-11,CASTLE>这是她的信笺抬头
<15-11,CASTLE>That is her letterhead.

371
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,650
<15-12,BECKETT>敬启者
<15-12,BECKETT>"To whom it may concern,

372
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,050
<15-12,BECKETT>我感觉我的死期即将来临
<15-12,BECKETT>I feel that my murder is imminent."

373
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,070
<15-13,BECKETT>尽管我不知道
<15-13,BECKETT>"And although I have no idea yet

374
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,950
<15-13,BECKETT>死亡会在何时何地到来
<15-13,BECKETT>"where or when this event will occur,

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,750
<15-13,BECKETT>但我已预见到自己的死期
<15-13,BECKETT>"I have had a vision of my death.

376
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,780
<15-13,BECKETT>在幻觉中  我不能呼吸
<15-13,BECKETT>"In the vision, I could not breathe.

377
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,610
<15-13,BECKETT>我看见穿着黑衣的男子  数字7518
<15-13,BECKETT>"I saw a man dressed in black, the number 7-5-1-8,

378
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,790
<15-13,BECKETT>我可以听到从远处传来
<15-13,BECKETT>"and I could hear a furious pounding

379
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,400
<15-13,BECKETT>一声重击
<15-13,BECKETT>"from what seemed to be far away.

380
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,060
<15-13,BECKETT>抱歉我不能更具体些
<15-13,BECKETT>I'm sorry I cannot be more specific"--

381
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,730
<15-14,CASTLE>这个灵媒预期了自己的谋杀案啊
<15-14,CASTLE>The psychic predicted her own murder!

382
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,450
<15-15,BECKETT>或者是凶手写来想扰乱视线
<15-15,BECKETT>Or the killer wrote this in order to throw us off.

383
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,150
<15-15,BECKETT>去查一下  运气好的话可能会有指纹
<15-15,BECKETT>Run it. Maybe we'll get lucky with the prints.

384
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,120
<15-16,RYAN>-你觉得她真的  -不觉得
<15-16,RYAN>- Do you think she really-- - No.

385
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,590
<15-16,RYAN>我也不觉得
<15-16,RYAN>Yeah, me neither.

386
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,150
<16-1,BECKETT>蕾妮 有何线索
<16-1,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie. What do we got?

387
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,130
<16-2,LANIE>死亡原因是失血及窒息
<16-2,LANIE>We've got cause of death-- blood loss and asphyxiation.

388
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,060
<16-2,LANIE>我也可以确认死亡时间
<16-2,LANIE>And I'm officially putting the time of death

389
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,930
<16-2,LANIE>是周一傍晚5点至7点期间
<16-2,LANIE>betweem 5:00 and 7:00 p.M. On Monday evening.

390
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,270
<16-3,BECKETT>那就排除艾伯特·莫雷诺嫌疑  还有呢
<16-3,BECKETT>So that les out Albert Moreno. What else?

391
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,820
<16-4,LANIE>冰锥上没有刮痕
<16-4,LANIE>There were no scratches on the ice pick blade.

392
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,110
<16-4,LANIE>是全新的
<16-4,LANIE>It was brand-new,

393
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,540
<16-4,LANIE>可能特地为这次行凶买的
<16-4,LANIE>probably bought special just for the occasion.

394
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,320
<16-4,LANIE>她的手机在她手上
<16-4,LANIE>And her cell phone was in her hand.

395
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,980
<16-4,LANIE>她可能在死前试图打电话求救
<16-4,LANIE>She may have tried to dial for help before she expired.

396
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,320
<16-4,LANIE>数字和她女儿的
<16-4,LANIE>The digits match the beginning

397
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,620
<16-4,LANIE>电话号开头吻合
<16-4,LANIE>of her daughter's phone number.

398
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,490
<16-4,LANIE>1-718-55-
<16-4,LANIE>1-718-55--

399
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,580
<16-5,CASTLE>7-1-8-5
<16-5,CASTLE>7-1-8-5?

400
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,960
<16-5,CASTLE>那是信上的数字
<16-5,CASTLE>Those are the numbers from the letter.

401
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,920
<16-5,CASTLE>顺序不同
<16-5,CASTLE>They're in a different order,

402
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,240
<16-5,CASTLE>但数字一样
<16-5,CASTLE>but those arthe same numbers.

403
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,580
<16-6,CASTLE>继续啊  继续说巧合啊
<16-6,CASTLE>Oh, go on. Go on. Say "Coincidence."

404
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,810
<16-7,BECKETT>巧合
<16-7,BECKETT>Coincidence.

405
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,210
<17-1,CASTLE>我只是说  这根本无懈可击  仅此而已
<17-1,CASTLE>I'm just saying, it's irrefutable, that's all.

406
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,150
<17-2,BECKETT>这才不是无懈可击  卡塞尔
<17-2,BECKETT>It is not irrefutable, Castle.

407
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,500
<17-2,BECKETT>事实上  这完全就是不攻自破
<17-2,BECKETT>As a matter of fact, it is completely refutable.

408
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,950
<17-3,CASTLE>好  继续  攻破我啊
<17-3,CASTLE>Okay, go on. Refute me.

409
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,180
<17-4,BECKETT>好吧  听好了
<17-4,BECKETT>Okay, how about this?

410
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,380
<17-4,BECKETT>薇薇安在拨打她女儿的电话
<17-4,BECKETT>Vivien is dialing her daughter's number.

411
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,310
<17-4,BECKETT>凶手进来  刺中她的脖子
<17-4,BECKETT>Our killer comes in, stabs her in the neck,

412
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,950
<17-4,BECKETT>捡起手机
<17-4,BECKETT>picks up the phone,

413
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,880
<17-4,BECKETT>扔进沙发里
<17-4,BECKETT>drops it into the sofa after her,

414
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,720
<17-4,BECKETT>接着把数字写在信上
<17-4,BECKETT>and then puts the numbers into the letter

415
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,620
<17-4,BECKETT>和其他虚假预兆放在一起
<17-4,BECKETT>along with the rest of the fake predictions.

416
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,260
<17-4,BECKETT>驳倒
<17-4,BECKETT>Refuted.

417
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,990
<17-5,CASTLE>没人在手机里按号码了
<17-5,CASTLE>No one types a number into a cell phone anymore.

418
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,230
<17-6,ESPOSITO>信件的检测结果没有太多线索
<17-6,ESPOSITO>Preliminaries on the letter aren't giving us much.

419
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,530
<17-6,ESPOSITO>没有可用的指纹和DNA
<17-6,ESPOSITO>There are no usable prints and no D.N.A.

420
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,260
<17-6,ESPOSITO>薇薇安楼下的邮箱
<17-6,ESPOSITO>And the pick up at the mail drop

421
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,170
<17-6,ESPOSITO>收信时间是下午6点
<17-6,ESPOSITO>in Vivien's building is 6:00 p.m.

422
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,100
<17-7,BECKETT>时间足够让凶手在她死后
<17-7,BECKETT>Time enough for the killer to have written it

423
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,340
<17-7,BECKETT>写下来再寄出去
<17-7,BECKETT>and mailed it after she was dead.

424
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,640
<17-8,CASTLE>但是为什么  为什么要这样麻烦呢
<17-8,CASTLE>But why? Why go through all that trouble?

425
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,510
<17-9,BECKETT>让我们纠缠杜撰疯狂的理论
<17-9,BECKETT>To keep us spinning wild theories

426
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,220
<17-9,BECKETT>追查什么黑衣男子
<17-9,BECKETT>and chasing after men dressed in black

427
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,980
<17-9,BECKETT>而不是去调查那些真凭实据
<17-9,BECKETT>instead of following hard evidence.

428
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,940
<17-9,BECKETT>你看啊  卡塞尔  这封信甚至没有署名
<17-9,BECKETT>I mean, come on, Castle. The letter's not even signed.

429
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,190
<17-10,ESPOSITO>事实上  我和佩妮·马查德谈了这个
<17-10,ESPOSITO>Actually, I talked to Penny Marchand about that.

430
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,610
<17-10,ESPOSITO>她说她母亲有可能
<17-10,ESPOSITO>She says it's possible her mother

431
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,390
<17-10,ESPOSITO>打了一封信但是不署名
<17-10,ESPOSITO>would type a letter and not sign it

432
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,980
<17-10,ESPOSITO>因为她怕她的预言是错的
<17-10,ESPOSITO>in case her prediction was wrong.

433
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,470
<17-10,ESPOSITO>她不想别人在网上
<17-10,ESPOSITO>She wouldn't want anybody selling

434
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,360
<17-10,ESPOSITO>风传她的失准
<17-10,ESPOSITO>her mistakes on the internet.

435
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,930
<17-11,BECKETT>但我们还是不能证明
<17-11,BECKETT>But we still can't prove

436
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,450
<17-11,BECKETT>薇薇安真的写了这封信
<17-11,BECKETT>that Vivien actually wrote the letter.

437
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,930
<17-12,CASTLE>直到其他预言实现为止
<17-12,CASTLE>Until her other predictions come true.

438
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,060
<17-13,ESPOSITO>我只是
<17-13,ESPOSITO>You know, I'm just...

439
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,660
<17-14,RYAN>太好了  你回来了  我有些线索
<17-14,RYAN>Good. You're back. I think I got something.

440
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,340
<17-14,RYAN>还记得薇薇安的第一个大案子吗
<17-14,RYAN>Remember Vivien's first big case?

441
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,030
<17-15,BECKETT>记得  那家伙有失踪的妻子
<17-15,BECKETT>Yeah, the guy with the missing wife

442
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,300
<17-15,BECKETT>和金发女友安博尔
<17-15,BECKETT>and the blonde girlfriend named Amber.

443
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,120
<17-16,RYAN>他叫史蒂夫·亚当斯
<17-16,RYAN>His name is Steve Adams.

444
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,610
<17-16,RYAN>警员正带他过来
<17-16,RYAN>Unis are bringing him up right now.

445
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,010
<17-16,RYAN>他们从未找到他妻子的尸体
<17-16,RYAN>They never found his wife's body.

446
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,550
<17-16,RYAN>他因二级谋杀被判七年有期徒刑
<17-16,RYAN>He did seven years for second degree.

447
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,470
<17-16,RYAN>他两个月前获得假释
<17-16,RYAN>They released him two months ago on parole,

448
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,020
<17-16,RYAN>仅在他同意佩戴
<17-16,RYAN>only after he agreed to wear

449
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,590
<17-16,RYAN>追踪器后获得假释
<17-16,RYAN>an anklet with a tracking device.

450
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,330
<17-16,RYAN>我打给他的假释官  他发过来这个
<17-16,RYAN>So I called his P.O., and he sent over this.

451
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,630
<17-17,BECKETT>追踪系统显示史蒂夫周一下午
<17-17,BECKETT>The GPS readout puts Steve at Vivien's address

452
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,890
<17-17,BECKETT>出现在薇薇安家
<17-17,BECKETT>Monday afternoon.

453
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,160
<17-17,BECKETT>薇薇安两点结束和宝拉和玛丽娜·卡西利亚斯的会谈
<17-17,BECKETT>So Vivien finishes with Paula and Marina Casillas at 2:00,

454
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,370
<17-17,BECKETT>艾伯特·莫雷诺两点半从后门离开
<17-17,BECKETT>Albert Moreno exists out the back door at 2:30,

455
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,040
<17-17,BECKETT>三点是她和T.J.的预约
<17-17,BECKETT>and now it's time for her 3:00 P.M. With T.J.

456
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,940
<17-18,CASTLE>史蒂夫·亚当斯1:36至2:48期间在那里
<17-18,CASTLE>Steve Adams was there from 1:36 to 2:48,

457
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,370
<17-18,CASTLE>等待时机
<17-18,CASTLE>waiting for his opportunity.

458
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,650
<17-19,BECKETT>所以他等到她独自一人时
<17-19,BECKETT>So he waits there until she's alone,

459
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,420
<17-19,BECKETT>抓住她  刺死她然后塞进沙发里
<17-19,BECKETT>jus her, stabs her, and then stuffs her in the couch.

460
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,050
<17-20,STEVE ADAMS>-这是骚扰  -放轻松点
<17-20,STEVE ADAMS>- This is harassment!  - Take it easy.

461
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,720
<17-20,STEVE ADAMS>我没有干坏事
<17-20,STEVE ADAMS>I haven't done anything wrong!

462
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,460
<17-20,STEVE ADAMS>就在这里  安静
<17-20,STEVE ADAMS>right through here. Calm down.

463
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,430
<17-21,CASTLE>他穿着黑色衣服
<17-21,CASTLE>Ah. He's wearing all black.

464
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,440
<17-22,BECKETT>这肯定是巧合
<17-22,BECKETT>It's gotta be a coincidence.

465
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,800
<17-23,CASTLE>或者黑色是一种罪
<17-23,CASTLE>Or black is the new guilty.

466
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,960
<18-1,ADAMS>我没杀她
<18-1,ADAMS>I didn't kill her.

467
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,020
<18-2,BECKETT>你是最后一个看见她的人
<18-2,BECKETT>You were the last one to see her alive.

468
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,650
<18-2,BECKETT>你踝环上追踪器显示
<18-2,BECKETT>The gps on your anklet indicates

469
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,250
<18-2,BECKETT>你在薇薇安被杀当天
<18-2,BECKETT>that you were at Vivien's office

470
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,190
<18-2,BECKETT>在她的办公室待了超过一小时
<18-2,BECKETT>For over an hour the day that she was killed.

471
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,370
<18-3,ADAMS>没错  但不是你想的那样
<18-3,ADAMS>Yeah, but it's not what you think.

472
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,400
<18-3,ADAMS>上周  我接到叫科迪·多内力打来的电话
<18-3,ADAMS>Last week, I got a call from a guy named Cody Donnelly.

473
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,950
<18-3,ADAMS>他是真人秀节目制作人
<18-3,ADAMS>He's a reality TV producer.

474
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,600
<18-3,ADAMS>他说他可以帮我洗脱罪名
<18-3,ADAMS>He said he could help me clear my name.

475
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,630
<18-4,CASTLE>那他打算怎么做
<18-4,CASTLE>How was he gonna do that?

476
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,870
<18-5,ADAMS>在我妻子失踪的第二天
<18-5,ADAMS>The day after my wife disappeared,

477
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,440
<18-5,ADAMS>薇薇安·马查德告诉警察她在幻影中
<18-5,ADAMS>Vivien Marchand told the cop she did a vision at the bar

478
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,660
<18-5,ADAMS>看见我和女友安博尔在酒吧
<18-5,ADAMS>with my girlfriend Amber.

479
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,180
<18-6,CASTLE>这是真的
<18-6,CASTLE>Which was true.

480
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,310
<18-7,ADAMS>我当时在那里吗  是的
<18-7,ADAMS>That I was there? Yeah.

481
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,000
<18-7,ADAMS>但她开始说还看见其他幻影
<18-7,ADAMS>But then she started saying she had other visions--

482
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,700
<18-7,ADAMS>我杀我妻子  这个我没有
<18-7,ADAMS>Visions that I murdered my wife, which I did not do--

483
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,310
<18-7,ADAMS>但关于安博尔  她对了一次
<18-7,ADAMS>bue was right once, about Amber,

484
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,820
<18-7,ADAMS>结果大家都相信她
<18-7,ADAMS>so everyone believed her.

485
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,960
<18-7,ADAMS>但薇薇安也撒谎了
<18-7,ADAMS>Only Vivien had lied about that, too.

486
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,950
<18-8,BECKETT>你的意思是
<18-8,BECKETT>What do you mean?

487
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,390
<18-9,ADAMS>科迪·多内力告诉我他有
<18-9,ADAMS>Cody Donnelly told me he had proof that Vivien

488
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,530
<18-9,ADAMS>证据可以证明
<18-9,ADAMS>was a customer in the same bar

489
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,490
<18-9,ADAMS>薇薇安那天也去过那间酒吧
<18-9,ADAMS>where I took Amber that day.

490
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,350
<18-9,ADAMS>是她亲眼看到我
<18-9,ADAMS>So she saw me, all right, with her own eyes.

491
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,660
<18-9,ADAMS>根本就没有灵媒这回事  没有
<18-9,ADAMS>There was nothing psychic about it, nothing.

492
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,130
<18-10,BECKETT>所以你想到  假如可以证明薇薇安是个骗子
<18-10,BECKETT>So you figured if you could prove that Vivien was a fraud,

493
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,410
<18-10,BECKETT>那么也许人们也会相信
<18-10,BECKETT>that maybe people would believe

494
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,940
<18-10,BECKETT>你没有杀害你妻子
<18-10,BECKETT>that you hadn't killed your wife as well.

495
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,660
<18-11,ADAMS>我是无辜的  但多亏了薇薇安
<18-11,ADAMS>I'm an innocent man, but thanks to Vivien,

496
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,540
<18-11,ADAMS>全国人民都相信我杀了我妻子
<18-11,ADAMS>everyone in the state believed that I killed my wife.

497
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,540
<18-11,ADAMS>她需要预约
<18-11,ADAMS>She got a book deal.

498
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,670
<18-11,ADAMS>我预约了7点至10点
<18-11,ADAMS>I got 7 to 10.

499
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,320
<18-12,BECKETT>那科迪·多内力的目的是什么
<18-12,BECKETT>And what was in it for Cody Donnelly?

500
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,980
<18-13,ADAMS>他想让我和薇薇安出现在他的真人秀里
<18-13,ADAMS>He wanted me and Vivien to be in his reality show,

501
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,260
<18-13,ADAMS>《你毁了我的人生》
<18-13,ADAMS>"You've ruined my life."

502
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,690
<18-14,CASTLE>我喜欢那节目
<18-14,CASTLE>Oh, I love that show.

503
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,220
<18-14,CASTLE>这是冤假错案的人们对那些错判官
<18-14,CASTLE>I-it's where people unleash their righteous fury

504
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,190
<18-14,CASTLE>发泄正义怒火的地方
<18-14,CASTLE>against those who have wronged them.

505
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,850
<18-14,CASTLE>结局通常是一笑泯恩仇
<18-14,CASTLE>Usually ends in tears and a hug.

506
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,860
<18-15,ADAMS>科迪和我带上摄影队去了她办公室
<18-15,ADAMS>Cody and me, we went to her office with a camera crew.

507
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,000
<18-15,ADAMS>我们坐在车上等了将近一小时
<18-15,ADAMS>We sat outside in the van for almost an hour.

508
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,330
<18-15,ADAMS>当她最终出现时  我质问她
<18-15,ADAMS>When she finally came out, I confronted her.

509
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,130
<18-15,ADAMS>我骂她是骗子
<18-15,ADAMS>I called her fake.

510
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,870
<18-15,ADAMS>科迪让我搞大这事  我照做了
<18-15,ADAMS>Cody told me to make it big, so I did.

511
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,990
<18-16,BECKETT>那薇薇安有何应对
<18-16,BECKETT>And what did Vivien do?

512
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,910
<18-17,ADAMS>她害怕了
<18-17,ADAMS>Mostly she freaked.

513
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,960
<18-17,ADAMS>接着她上了一辆出租车跑了
<18-17,ADAMS>Then she got in a cab and took off.

514
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,740
<18-17,ADAMS>科迪马上载我回公寓  在45大街
<18-17,ADAMS>Cody dropped me at my apartment on second and 45th,

515
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,040
<18-17,ADAMS>我再也没见到她
<18-17,ADAMS>and I never saw her again.

516
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,050
<19-1,BECKETT>全球卫星定位系统表明
<19-1,BECKETT>Gps puts Adams at his apartment

517
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,380
<19-1,BECKETT>薇薇安被杀时  亚当斯在自己公寓里
<19-1,BECKETT>at the time that Vivien was murdered.

518
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,200
<19-1,BECKETT>寻找目击证人核实这事
<19-1,BECKETT>Find me some witnesses that can verify that.

519
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,340
<19-2,RYAN>你不相信全球卫星定位系统
<19-2,RYAN>You don't trust the gps?

520
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,210
<19-3,BECKETT>不信  这东西可以篡改
<19-3,BECKETT>No, those things can be tampered with.

521
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,980
<19-3,BECKETT>薇薇安告诉她女儿
<19-3,BECKETT>So Vivien told her daughter

522
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,090
<19-3,BECKETT>她整个下午都在办公室
<19-3,BECKETT>that she was gonna be at the office all afternoon,

523
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,710
<19-3,BECKETT>而在2:45时  她上了一辆出租车离开
<19-3,BECKETT>and then at 2:45, she takes a cab and leaves

524
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,830
<19-3,BECKETT>去见T.J.  姓名不详
<19-3,BECKETT>to see T.J., whoever that is.

525
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,740
<19-3,BECKETT>去找史蒂夫·亚当斯的制作人科迪·多内力
<19-3,BECKETT>Let's get ahold of Steve Adams' producer, Cody Donnelly.

526
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,380
<19-3,BECKETT>我想早上见见他
<19-3,BECKETT>I want to see him and his footage of Vivien

527
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,270
<19-3,BECKETT>和关于薇薇安的脚本
<19-3,BECKETT>first thing in the morning.

528
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,060
<19-4,RYAN>收到
<19-4,RYAN>You got it.

529
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,570
<20-1,CASTLE>很高兴你回来了
<20-1,CASTLE>I am so glad that you are home.

530
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,410
<20-1,CASTLE>我今天衰到令人难以置信
<20-1,CASTLE>You would not believe the day I had.

531
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,800
<20-2,MARTHA>你就别和我比了
<20-2,MARTHA>Oh, I think I got you beat.

532
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,980
<20-3,CASTLE>妈妈  怎么了
<20-3,CASTLE>Mother, what's wrong?

533
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,880
<20-3,CASTLE>你为何还和切特叔叔订婚呢
<20-3,CASTLE>And why are you still engaged to uncle Chet?

534
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,840
<20-3,CASTLE>哦  理查德
<20-3,CASTLE>Oh, Richard.

<20-4,MARTHA>什么
<20-4,MARTHA>What?

537
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,590
<20-5,CASTLE>怎么回事
<20-5,CASTLE>How?

538
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,480
<20-6,MARTHA>我今早去他家里
<20-6,MARTHA>I went to his apartment this morning,

539
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,780
<20-6,MARTHA>他孩子在那里
<20-6,MARTHA>and his kids are there-- boomer and lotte.

540
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,210
<20-6,MARTHA>他们说
<20-6,MARTHA>They said...

541
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,650
<20-6,MARTHA>他在睡梦中中风了
<20-6,MARTHA>He'd had a stroke in his sleep.

542
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,090
<20-6,MARTHA>神哪  我简直
<20-6,MARTHA>I mean, god, I...

543
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,020
<20-6,MARTHA>他还那么年轻  而且
<20-6,MARTHA>He was so young, and...

544
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,020
<20-7,CASTLE>妈妈  我很抱歉
<20-7,CASTLE>Mother, I am so sorry.

545
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,230
<20-7,CASTLE>然后
<20-7,CASTLE>So...

546
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,430
<20-8,MARTHA>博莫和洛蒂看到了这戒指
<20-8,MARTHA>Boomer and Lotte see the ring.

547
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,900
<20-8,MARTHA>就以为他们的老爸
<20-8,MARTHA>Naturally they assume that their father

548
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,170
<20-8,MARTHA>和我已经订婚了
<20-8,MARTHA>and I are engaged,

549
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,150
<20-9,MARTHA>他们很担心
<20-9,MARTHA>and now they're worried

550
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,070
<20-8,MARTHA>我会如何面对这个噩耗
<20-8,MARTHA>about how I'll handle the news.

551
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,940
<20-8,MARTHA>然后
<20-8,MARTHA>And, uh,

552
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,870
<20-8,MARTHA>我陪了他们一天
<20-8,MARTHA>I spent the whole day with them,

553
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,180
<20-8,MARTHA>帮着接待客人
<20-8,MARTHA>receiving visitors.

554
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,610
<20-8,MARTHA>他们不停跟我讲
<20-8,MARTHA>And they kept telling me...

555
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,890
<20-8,MARTHA>自从和我在一起后
<20-8,MARTHA>How happy their father had been

556
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,610
<20-8,MARTHA>他们的父亲是多么的快乐
<20-8,MARTHA>since we'd been together,

557
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,020
<20-8,MARTHA>他是如何的

<20-9,MARTHA>And there I was, about to break his heart.

560
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,860
<20-9,MARTHA>他们还要我做追悼致辞
<20-9,MARTHA>And now they want me to give the eulogy.

561
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,630
<20-10,MARTHA>我怎么做得到
<20-10,MARTHA>I don't think I can.

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,050
<21-1,ADAMS>你跟条子说"看"到我在酒吧
<21-1,ADAMS>You told the cops that you had a vision of me in a bar.

<21-4,BECKETT>What do we got?

574
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,660
<21-5,RYAN>目前  就和史蒂夫·亚当斯说的一样
<21-5,RYAN>So far, it's going just like Steve Adams says.

575
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,990
<21-5,RYAN>薇薇安从办公室出来  他直接冲了上去
<21-5,RYAN>Vivien comes out, he gets in her face.

576

<21-5,RYAN>-我可以证明  -快把他弄走
<21-5,RYAN>- And I can prove it...  - Get him outta here...

<21-9,PENNY>Detective Beckett.

582
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,160
<21-10,BECKETT>你好  佩妮  有什么事吗
<21-10,BECKETT>Hi, Penny. What are you doing here?

583
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,670
<21-11,PENNY>我们可以单独谈谈吗
<21-11,PENNY>Is there somewhere we could talk privately?

584
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,270
<22-1,BECKETT>怎么了  是想起什么了吗
<22-1,BECKETT>What's wrong? Did you remember something?

585
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,990
<22-1,BECKETT>不
<22-1,BECKETT>No.

586
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,160
<22-2,PENNY>不是关于那个
<22-2,PENNY>It's not that.

587
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
<22-2,PENNY>我想说
<22-2,PENNY>I'm afraid I wasn't

588
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,020
<22-2,PENNY>我之前没有完全说出事实
<22-2,PENNY>completely honest with you the other day.

589
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,850
<22-2,PENNY>事实上
<22-2,PENNY>The fact is,

590
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,150
<22-2,PENNY>我和我妈妈一样也有一点超能力
<22-2,PENNY>I have a little bit of what my mother did.

591
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,780
<22-2,PENNY>有时候我会做些很灵验的梦
<22-2,PENNY>Sometimes I have dreams that are meaningful.

592
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,020
<22-2,PENNY>昨晚  我梦到了你
<22-2,PENNY>Last night, I had a dream about you.

593
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:29,880
<22-3,BECKETT>然后呢
<22-3,BECKETT>Okay.

594
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,580
<22-4,PENNY>我也说不清  就是强烈的感觉到
<22-4,PENNY>And I can't really explain why, but I feel very strongly

595
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,170
<22-4,PENNY>我必须告诉你些事情
<22-4,PENNY>that I'm supposed to tell you something,

596
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,800
<22-4,PENNY>是很重要的事  你准备好了吗

599
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,040
<22-8,PENNY>亚历山大  我不知道他是谁或对你有何意义
<22-8,PENNY>Alexander. I don't know who he is or what he means to you.

600
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,650
<22-9,BECKETT>我不认识叫亚历山大的人
<22-9,BECKETT>I don't know any Alexander.

601
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,210
<22-10,PENNY>你会的  你会遇见一个叫亚历山大的人
<22-10,PENNY>You will. You will meet an Alexander.

<22-10,PENNY>And he will be extremely important to you.

603
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,670
<22-10,PENNY>在未来的某一天  他会救你的命
<22-10,PENNY>At some future date, he may save your life.

604
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,520
<22-10,PENNY>好吧
<22-10,PENNY>Okay.

<23-2,CASTLE>Ah, she'd never go for it. She's a real b--

613
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,170
<23-3,BECKETT>多内力先生  感谢你能过来
<23-3,BECKETT>Mr. Donnelly, I appreciate you coming...

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,570
<23-3,BECKETT>你在这做什么
<23-3,BECKETT>What are you doing here?

615
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,380
<23-4,CASTLE>我再插一句  我想说的是"教条维护者"
<23-4,CASTLE>Uh, for the record, I was gonna say "Big rule follower."

616
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,590
<23-4,CASTLE>我对天发誓  绝对不是在讨论案子
<23-4,CASTLE>I was not discussing the case. I swear to god.

617
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,350
<23-4,CASTLE>《赤裸热浪》明天就发售了
<23-4,CASTLE>Uh, "Naked Heat" comes out tomorrow,

618
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,320
<23-4,CASTLE>科迪呢  正在赞赏广告牌
<23-4,CASTLE>and Cody here was admiring the billboards.

619
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,020
<23-5,DONNELLY>海报上惹火的照片是你吗
<23-5,DONNELLY>Is that your smoking-hot silhouette on the posters then?

620
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,590
<23-5,DONNELLY>不是
<23-5,DONNELLY>No.

621
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,730
<23-6,BECKETT>多内力先生  离开了薇薇安的办公室后
<23-6,BECKETT>So, Mr. Donnelly, where did you go

622
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,190
<23-6,BECKETT>你去了哪儿
<23-6,BECKETT>after you left Vivien's office?

623
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,570
<23-7,DONNELLY>录完那段节目
<23-7,DONNELLY>After we got all that great footage,

624
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,800
<23-7,DONNELLY>我把史蒂夫送回了家
<23-7,DONNELLY>I dropped Steve off at his place

625
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,360
<23-7,DONNELLY>那时候大约是  三点半左右
<23-7,DONNELLY>around, uh, well, 3:30 or so.

626
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,100
<23-7,DONNELLY>接着就接到了薇薇安·马查德的电话
<23-7,DONNELLY>That was just before Vivien Marchand called me.

627
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,000
<23-8,BECKETT>是吗  她想做什么呢
<23-8,BECKETT>Really? And what did she want?

628
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,450
<23-9,DONNELLY>挽救她的事业
<23-9,DONNELLY>To save what was left of her career.

629
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,620
<23-9,DONNELLY>她清楚我们录的视频对她很不利
<23-9,DONNELLY>I mean, she knew the film I had on her was damaging.

630
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,400
<23-9,DONNELLY>她说若我毁了胶卷  她会给我更好的东西
<23-9,DONNELLY>She said if I buried it, she'd give me something better.

631
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,660
<23-10,CASTLE>什么更好的东西
<23-10,CASTLE>Better like what?

632
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,060
<23-11,DONNELLY>比如谋杀案
<23-11,DONNELLY>Better like murder.

633
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,280
<23-12,DONNELLY>薇薇安说她在追踪一个杀人犯
<23-12,DONNELLY>You see, Vivien said she was hot on a killer.

634
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
<23-12,DONNELLY>而且比史蒂夫·亚当斯那次更加轰动
<23-12,DONNELLY>She said it was bigger than Steve Adams.

635
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,170
<23-12,DONNELLY>这次  会出现尸体
<23-12,DONNELLY>This time, there was a body.

636
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,590
<23-12,DONNELLY>她让我拍下她揭露罪犯的
<23-12,DONNELLY>She was gonna let me film the moment that she confronted

637
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,560
<23-12,DONNELLY>那一刻
<23-12,DONNELLY>the soon-to-be accused.

638
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,030
<23-12,DONNELLY>她说她还得证实最后一个疑点
<23-12,DONNELLY>She said that she had to confirm one last suspicion,

639
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,130
<23-12,DONNELLY>而我必须准备好  随时待命
<23-12,DONNELLY>and that I had to be ready to go at a moment's notice

640
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,330
<23-12,DONNELLY>因为我们要抓一个杀人犯
<23-12,DONNELLY>'cause we were gonna catch a killer.

641
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,870
<23-13,CASTLE>什么时候揭露呢
<23-13,CASTLE>And when was this confrontation gonna take place?

642
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,870
<23-14,DONNELLY>很快  两小时后我收到一条紧急短信
<23-14,DONNELLY>Straightaway. I got an urgent text about two hours later.

643
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,870
<23-14,DONNELLY>我召集了工作人员  包括保安
<23-14,DONNELLY>I-I gathered up my crew, including security,

644
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,370
<23-14,DONNELLY>以为可以大干一场了
<23-14,DONNELLY>thinking this was it.

645
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,970
<23-14,DONNELLY>结果我给她打过去时  没人接听
<23-14,DONNELLY>And then when I called her back, no answer.

646
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,180
<23-14,DONNELLY>我猜那时她已经死了
<23-14,DONNELLY>I'm guessing she was already dead.

647
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,780
<24-1,CASTLE>有关于薇薇安追踪谋杀案的消息吗
<24-1,CASTLE>Any news on Vivien's hunt for a murderer?

648
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,030
<24-2,BECKETT>确实有人来找她解决
<24-2,BECKETT>Well, she had several clients who came to her

649
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,940
<24-2,BECKETT>一些家族疑案
<24-2,BECKETT>because of unsolved crimes in the family,

650
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,480
<24-2,BECKETT>但我们和那些人谈过
<24-2,BECKETT>but the ones that we talked to

651
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,950
<24-2,BECKETT>他们说那些案子和
<24-2,BECKETT>said that their cases are just as cold now

652
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,290
<24-2,BECKETT>之前一样毫无进展
<24-2,BECKETT>as when they first came to her.

653
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,600
<24-3,RYAN>嘿  我找到了那辆计程车
<24-3,RYAN>Hey, I found the cab.

654
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,320
<24-3,RYAN>司机说他把薇薇安带到了
<24-3,RYAN>The driver says he took Vivien to a residence

655
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,800
<24-3,RYAN>112大道沿河边的居民楼
<24-3,RYAN>at 112th and riverside.

656
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,530
<24-3,RYAN>看门人说记得薇薇安
<24-3,RYAN>The doorman says he remembers Vivien

657
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,890
<24-3,RYAN>上楼到2C号房间
<24-3,RYAN>going up to apartment 2c.

658
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,820
<24-3,RYAN>租住人是尼克和托尼·约翰斯顿
<24-3,RYAN>It's rented to Nick and Toni Johnston.

659
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,140
<24-4,BECKETT>-托尼·约翰斯顿  -T.J
<24-4,BECKETT>- Toni Johnston.  - T.J.

660
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,610
<24-4,BECKETT>若薇薇安在死的那天来见托尼·约翰斯顿
<24-4,BECKETT>If Vivien came to see Toni Johnston the day she died,

661
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,740
<25-1,CASTLE>肯定是有很重要的事
<25-1,CASTLE>it had to have been about something important,

662
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,510
<25-1,CASTLE>比如和她追踪的杀人犯有关
<25-1,CASTLE>like this killer she was chasing.

663
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,540
<25-1,CASTLE>不过你可能会说那只是巧合
<25-1,CASTLE>But you'll probably say it was just a coincidence.

664
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,650
<25-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我相不相信命运女神
<25-2,BECKETT>Castle, why is it so important to you

665
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,620
<25-2,BECKETT>灵媒或圣诞老人
<25-2,BECKETT>that I believe all this stuff about

666
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,190
<25-2,BECKETT>对你来说就这么重要吗
<25-2,BECKETT>Fates and psychics and Santa Claus?

667
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
<25-2,BECKETT>因为
<25-2,BECKETT>Because...

668
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,730
<25-3,CASTLE>若你不相信可能存在魔力
<25-3,CASTLE>If you don't believe in even the possibility of magic,

669
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,650
<25-3,CASTLE>你就永远不会发现它
<25-3,CASTLE>you'll never, ever find it.

670
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,000
<25-4,TONI JOHNSTON>-请问有事吗  -托尼吗
<25-4,TONI JOHNSTON>- Can I help you?  - Toni?

671
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,660
<25-5,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特警探
<25-5,BECKETT>I'm detective Kate Beckett,

672
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,000
<25-5,BECKETT>这位是理查德·卡塞尔
<25-5,BECKETT>and this is Richard Castle.

673
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,830
<25-6,TONI>哦  天哪  天哪  天哪
<25-6,TONI>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

674
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,980
<25-7,TONI>我担心死了
<25-7,TONI>I'm so stressed out.

675
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,440
<25-7,TONI>这简直太诡异了
<25-7,TONI>I can't believe this is happening.

676
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,850
<25-8,BECKETT>看来你知道薇薇安被杀害一事了
<25-8,BECKETT>So you know that Vivien was murdered?

677
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,530
<25-9,TONI>我昨天看到新闻报道后
<25-9,TONI>When I saw the paper yesterday,

678
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,020
<25-9,TONI>差点把燕麦片给吐了出来
<25-9,TONI>I nearly puked up my oatmeal.

679
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,990
<25-10,BECKETT>周一薇薇安为什么会来你家
<25-10,BECKETT>Why did Vivien come to visit you on Monday?

680
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,760
<25-11,TONI>那可是件涉及隐私的事
<25-11,TONI>This is all very personal and private,

681
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,190
<25-11,TONI>而且事关我的性生活
<25-11,TONI>and it involves my sex life.

682
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,130
<25-11,TONI>你能保证不说出去吗
<25-11,TONI>Will you promise to keep it confident?

683
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
<25-12,CASTLE>放一百个心
<25-12,CASTLE>Absolutely.

684
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,330
<25-13,TONI>好吧  今年年初  我做了件很糟糕的事
<25-13,TONI>Okay, earlier this year, I did a terrible thing.

685
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,470
<25-13,TONI>我和我老公的上司有过一段婚外情
<25-13,TONI>I had an affair with my husband's boss.

686
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,370
<25-13,TONI>我们非常谨慎  没被人发现
<25-13,TONI>Very discreet-- no one ever knew about it.

687
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,010
<25-13,TONI>所以薇薇安才跟我联系
<25-13,TONI>That's why Vivien called me.

688
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,460
<25-14,CASTLE>她知道那件事
<25-14,CASTLE>She knew about the affair?

689
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,880
<25-15,TONI>她突然给我打电话
<25-15,TONI>She called me out of the blue.

690
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,810
<25-15,TONI>她知道我们是在公司的圣诞晚宴上相遇的
<25-15,TONI>She knew we met at the company Christmas party,

691
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,700
<25-15,TONI>经常在星爆旅馆私会
<25-15,TONI>that we used to rendezvous at the Starburst hotel,

692
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:28,880
<25-16,CASTLE>以及其他所有事情
<25-16,CASTLE>everything.

693
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,020
<25-16,CASTLE>邪乎啊
<25-16,CASTLE>Extraordinary.

694
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,720
<25-17,TONI>我也这样想
<25-17,TONI>I know, right?

695
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,350
<25-17,TONI>我脑子里一团乱
<25-17,TONI>I mean, my mind was totally blown.

696
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,020
<25-18,BECKETT>婚外情
<25-18,BECKETT>An affair?

697
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,910
<25-18,BECKETT>约翰斯顿太太  薇薇安有没有
<25-18,BECKETT>Mrs. Johnston, did Vivien ever

698
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,720
<25-18,BECKETT>跟你提过有关谋杀案的事
<25-18,BECKETT>talk to you about mumder?

699
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,070
<25-19,TONI>没有  她只说她知道
<25-19,TONI>No. She just told me she knew

700
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,740
<25-19,TONI>我如何让我老公尼克戴了绿帽子
<25-19,TONI>how I had cheated on Nick, my husband,

701
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,080
<25-19,TONI>还问了很多关于他的问题
<25-19,TONI>and then she asked me a lot of questions about him.

702
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,140
<25-20,CASTLE>什么样的问题
<25-20,CASTLE>What kind of questions?

703
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,170
<25-21,TONI>他是否脾气很暴躁  我是否感到安全
<25-21,TONI>She asked if he had a temper, and if I felt safe.

704
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,050
<25-21,TONI>她确定尼克知道我出轨的事
<25-21,TONI>She was sure Nick did know about the affair.

705
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,360
<25-21,TONI>薇薇安说伴侣一般都知道的
<25-21,TONI>Vivien said the spouse always knows.

706
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,420
<25-22,CASTLE>她有没说过是怎么知道这些
<25-22,CASTLE>Did she ever say how she knew all of this,

707
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,890
<25-22,CASTLE>如此私密的事情的呢
<25-22,CASTLE>all of this incredibly personal information,

708
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,790
<25-22,CASTLE>这些细节根本不可能会有记录
<25-22,CASTLE>the details of which could not be readily found

709
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,570
<25-22,CASTLE>也不能从网上获得
<25-22,CASTLE>at a hall of records or through an internet search?

710
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,390
<25-23,TONI>她说了
<25-23,TONI>Oh, yeah.

711
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,710
<25-23,TONI>就是我外遇的那个人
<25-23,TONI>The guy I was cheating with?

712
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,820
<25-23,TONI>他一点不漏的告诉了她
<25-23,TONI>He told her everything.

713
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,550
<25-24,BECKETT>那我得跟他谈谈
<25-24,BECKETT>You know, I'm gonna have to speak with him.

714
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,020
<25-25,TONI>哦  不行  你不可能和他谈了
<25-25,TONI>Oh, oh, you can't. I mean, you can't.

715
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,780
<25-25,TONI>他已经死了  所以我才没再见过他
<25-25,TONI>He's dead. That's why we stopped seeing each other.

716
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,760
<25-25,TONI>他四月份死的  心脏病
<25-25,TONI>He died last April. Heart attack.

717
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,750
<25-26,BECKETT>你是说你死去的情人
<25-26,BECKETT>You're telling me that your dead lover

718
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,470
<25-26,BECKETT>跟薇薇安讲了你们的婚外情
<25-26,BECKETT>told Vivien about your affair?

719
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,760
<25-26,BECKETT>没错
<25-26,BECKETT>That's right.

720
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,500
<25-27,TONI>她说埃米利奥来到了她的梦中
<25-27,TONI>She said Emilio came to her in a dream.

721
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,160
<25-28,BECKETT>埃米利奥
<25-28,BECKETT>Emilio?

722
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,530
<25-29,TONI>埃米利奥·卡西利亚斯
<25-29,TONI>Emilio Casillas.

723
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,650
<25-30,CASTLE>你的情人是埃米利奥·卡西利亚斯
<25-30,CASTLE>Your lover was Emilio Casillas?

724
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,780
<26-1,CASTLE>怎么样
<26-1,CASTLE>Well?

725
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,290
<26-2,LANIE>埃米利奥·卡西利亚斯的尸检报告
<26-2,LANIE>Emilio Casillas' autopsy file

726
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,860
<26-2,LANIE>可是相当有趣啊
<26-2,LANIE>makes for some very interesting reading.

727
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,130
<26-3,CASTLE>先说你觉得他有可能是被谋杀的吗
<26-3,CASTLE>But do you think he was murdered?

728
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,100
<26-4,LANIE>根据法医的记录  除了严重心力衰竭这一
<26-4,LANIE>According to the M.E.'s notes, in addition to

729
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,600
<26-4,LANIE>致死病症外
<26-4,LANIE>the cause of death, which was massive heart failure...

730
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,510
<26-4,LANIE>卡西利亚斯还有脱发的症状
<26-4,LANIE>Casillas showed signs of alopecia,

731
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,870
<26-4,LANIE>他的指甲也在变薄
<26-4,LANIE>and his fingernails were thinning.

732
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,790
<26-5,CASTLE>那到底说明了什么呢
<26-5,CASTLE>Which means what, exactly?

733
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,140
<26-6,LANIE>我得挖出尸体做些检查
<26-6,LANIE>I'd have to exhume the body and run some tests,

734
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,240
<26-6,LANIE>不过有可能是硒过量引起的
<26-6,LANIE>but it could be toxic overdose of selenium.

735
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,680
<26-7,BECKETT>什么是硒
<26-7,BECKETT>And what's selenium?

736
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,220
<26-8,LANIE>那是人身体里面含有的一种矿物质
<26-8,LANIE>It's a mineral that's naturally found in the body,

737
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,080
<26-8,LANIE>少量的硒对人是有好处的
<26-8,LANIE>and in small amounts, is good for you.

738
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,060
<26-8,LANIE>有人甚至把它放入减肥药和健康饮品里
<26-8,LANIE>They even sometimes add it to diet pills, health drinks.

739
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,770
<26-8,LANIE>但过量的话就会引起中毒
<26-8,LANIE>But too much of it can be poisonous.

740
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,010
<26-9,CASTLE>健康饮品
<26-9,CASTLE>Health drinks.

741
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,490
<26-9,CASTLE>可能卡西利亚斯的公司产的维他命药片里
<26-9,CASTLE>Maybe it was also in the vitamins

742
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,990
<26-9,CASTLE>也有那种东西
<26-9,CASTLE>that the Casillases made.

743
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,660
<26-9,CASTLE>也就是说工厂里可能有
<26-9,CASTLE>So that would mean it would be at the factory.

744
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,170
<26-10,BECKETT>薇薇安告诉托尼  她老公知道
<26-10,BECKETT>Vivien told Toni that her husband knew

745
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,140
<26-10,BECKETT>她和埃米利奥·卡西利亚斯的事
<26-10,BECKETT>about the affair with Emilio Casillas.

746
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,070
<26-11,CASTLE>而托尼的老公尼克在卡西利亚斯的公司上班
<26-11,CASTLE>So Toni's husband Nick works at the Casillases' company.

747
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,970
<26-11,CASTLE>他能轻易拿到硒并接近埃米利奥
<26-11,CASTLE>He would have easy access to the selenium and to Emilio.

748
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,100
<26-12,BECKETT>卡西利亚斯的女儿不是说了吗
<26-12,BECKETT>And didn't the Casillases' daughter

749
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,020
<26-12,BECKETT>她父亲死于办公室
<26-12,BECKETT>say that her father died in the office?

750
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,640
<26-12,BECKETT>他可能就是在那儿被毒死的
<26-12,BECKETT>That's probably where he received the fatal dose.

751
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,150
<26-13,CASTLE>也即尼克·约翰斯顿
<26-13,CASTLE>So Nick Johnston

752
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,020
<26-13,CASTLE>发现了他老婆和他上司有一腿
<26-13,CASTLE>figures out his wife is sleeping with his boss...

753
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,870
<26-13,CASTLE>就毒死了他
<26-13,CASTLE>And he poisons him.

754
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,850
<26-14,BECKETT>然后尼克发现薇薇安在追查他
<26-14,BECKETT>And then Nick discovers that Vivien's on to him,

755
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,780
<26-14,BECKETT>就把她也杀了
<26-14,BECKETT>and kills her, too.

756
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:01,310
<27-1,BECKETT>嘿  我刚和尼克·约翰斯顿的工头谈过
<27-1,BECKETT>Hey. So I just spoke to, uh, Nick Johnston's foreman.

757
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,650
<27-2,ESPOSITO>他说薇薇安死的那天
<27-2,ESPOSITO>He said that Nick clocked out early

758
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,950
<26-12,BECKETT>尼克5点就走了
<26-12,BECKETT>the day that Vivien died, at 5:00.

759
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,460
<26-13,CASTLE>但他妻子说他至少到了7点才回家
<26-13,CASTLE>But his wife said he didn't get home till at least 7:00.

760
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,950
<27-1,BECKETT>那他就有足够的时间
<27-1,BECKETT>Well, that would've been plenty of time for him

761
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,510
<27-1,BECKETT>在信件被收走前赶到薇薇安的办公室
<27-1,BECKETT>to get to Vivien's office, murder her, write the letter,

762
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,990
<27-1,BECKETT>杀了她  并写好信
<27-1,BECKETT>all before the mail was picked up.

763
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,800
<27-1,BECKETT>但他又是怎么发现薇薇安找过托尼的呢
<27-1,BECKETT>But how did he find out that Vivien talked to Toni?

764
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,770
<27-1,BECKETT>-托尼不可能告诉他啊  -托尼是没有
<27-1,BECKETT>- Toni wouldn't have told him.  - Oh, Toni didn't.

765
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,240
<27-2,ESPOSITO>但薇薇安说了
<27-2,ESPOSITO>But Vivien did.

766
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,200
<27-2,ESPOSITO>工头说有个女人来找过尼克后
<27-2,ESPOSITO>The foreman said that Nick asked for the time off

767
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,950
<27-2,ESPOSITO>他就请假了
<27-2,ESPOSITO>after he was visited by a woman,

768
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,740
<27-2,ESPOSITO>那个女人看起来很像薇薇安·马查德
<27-2,ESPOSITO>a woman who looked a lot like Vivien Marchand.

769
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,940
<27-3,CASTLE>这样看来  薇薇安在按计划行事
<27-3,CASTLE>So Vivien was putting her plan into action.

770
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,910
<27-3,CASTLE>他把尼克引诱到办公室来
<27-3,CASTLE>She'd bring Nick down to her office,

771
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,190
<27-3,CASTLE>然后打电话给科迪·多内力
<27-3,CASTLE>then she'd call Cody Donnelly,

772
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,150
<27-3,CASTLE>让他带拍摄人员过来
<27-3,CASTLE>have him bring his camera crew.

773
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,820
<27-3,CASTLE>她将揭穿尼克谋杀
<27-3,CASTLE>She would confront Nick

774
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,690
<27-3,CASTLE>埃米利奥·卡西利亚斯的真相
<27-3,CASTLE>about Emilio Casillas' murder,

775
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,580
<27-3,CASTLE>并全部拍下来
<27-3,CASTLE>capture it all on film.

776
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,230
<27-4,BECKETT>薇薇安打算解决埃米利奥的案子
<27-4,BECKETT>Vivien was about to solve Emilio's murder,

777
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
<27-4,BECKETT>然后找回以前"纽约最著名灵媒"的
<27-4,BECKETT>and then be returned to her former glory

778
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,500
<27-4,BECKETT>光荣称号
<27-4,BECKETT>as New York's most famous psychic medium.

779
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,640
<27-5,CASTLE>她可真是大胆啊
<27-5,CASTLE>It's a pretty bold move.

780
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,300
<27-6,BECKETT>但她一开始是怎么接触到
<27-6,BECKETT>But how did she get on to

781
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,350
<27-6,BECKETT>埃米利奥的案子的呢
<27-6,BECKETT>Emilio's murder in the first place?

782
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,790
<27-7,CASTLE>我要说多少遍啊
<27-7,CASTLE>How many times do I have to say it?

783
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,280
<27-7,CASTLE>她是个  灵媒
<27-7,CASTLE>She was a... psychic.

784
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,870
<27-8,ESPOSITO>-不好意思  你说什么  -灵媒
<27-8,ESPOSITO>- I'm sorry. What?  - Psychic.

785
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,950
<27-9,CASTLE>或者
<27-9,CASTLE>Or...

786
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,220
<27-10,RYAN>她只是直觉很敏锐罢了
<27-10,RYAN>Maybe just very intuitive.

787
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,880
<27-10,RYAN>根据薇薇安的记录
<27-10,RYAN>According to Vivien's notes,

788
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,750
<27-10,RYAN>宝拉说过埃米利奥在死之前的几个月
<27-10,RYAN>Paula said Emilio had been working longer hours

789
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,090
<27-10,RYAN>工作时间加长了
<27-10,RYAN>in the months before his death.

790
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,390
<27-10,RYAN>她标记了"外遇?"
<27-10,RYAN>She wrote "Affair?"

791
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,990
<27-11,ESPOSITO>她还写了这个
<27-11,ESPOSITO>She also wrote this.

792
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,620
<27-11,ESPOSITO>星爆旅馆
<27-11,ESPOSITO>Starburst hotel.

793
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,190
<27-11,ESPOSITO>那是离埃米利奥的办公室最近的
<27-11,ESPOSITO>That's the closest place to Emilio's office

794
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,590
<27-11,ESPOSITO>有大把钟点房
<27-11,ESPOSITO>that rents by the hour.

795
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,700
<27-12,RYAN>那儿的经理说薇薇安上星期去过
<27-12,RYAN>The manager there said Vivien came by last week.

796
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,450
<27-12,RYAN>他向她证实了
<27-12,RYAN>He confirmed to Vivien

797
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,280
<27-12,RYAN>那对情侣自年初起就是常客了
<27-12,RYAN>that the lovebirds had been regulars early this year,

798
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,310
<27-12,RYAN>她给了他200美元的信息费
<27-12,RYAN>and she gave him 200 bucks for his trouble.

799
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,740
<27-13,CASTLE>好吧  那薇薇安又是怎么从怀疑有外遇
<27-13,CASTLE>Okay, but how does Vivien go from "Affair" in general

800
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,420
<27-13,CASTLE>到确定外遇对象是托尼·约翰斯顿的呢
<27-13,CASTLE>to "Affair with Toni Johnston"?

801
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,190
<27-13,CASTLE>老兄  这可是一个大突破啊
<27-13,CASTLE>That, my friends, is a pretty big leap.

802
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,550
<27-14,RYAN>没错  确实如此
<27-14,RYAN>Yeah, uh, that is

803
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,040
<27-14,RYAN>不过你看了这照片就知道了
<27-14,RYAN>until you see the picture.

804
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,540
<27-14,RYAN>这是从薇薇安的调查资料里找到的
<27-14,RYAN>This is from Vivien's research.

805
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,330
<27-14,RYAN>穿红色礼服的是托尼  她旁边的是埃米利奥
<27-14,RYAN>This is Toni in the red dress, and Emilio next to her,

806
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,590
<27-14,RYAN>在上一次公司的圣诞晚会上
<27-14,RYAN>At the company's last christmas party.

807
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,790
<27-14,RYAN>相当舒适  哈
<27-14,RYAN>Pretty cozy, huh?

808
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,260
<27-15,CASTLE>她是从哪里得到的
<27-15,CASTLE>Where did she get this?

809
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,330
<27-16,RYAN>噢  卡西利亚斯的维他命制造厂里
<27-16,RYAN>Oh, there's a bulletin board

810
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,390
<27-16,RYAN>有一个告示牌
<27-16,RYAN>At the Casillases' vitamin factory

811
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,860
<27-16,RYAN>员工会把照片公布在上面
<27-16,RYAN>Where employees post pictures.

812
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:05,830
<27-16,RYAN>她可能从那儿拿到的
<27-16,RYAN>She could've taken it from there.

813
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,040
<27-17,BECKETT>薇薇安怀疑埃米利奥有了外遇
<27-17,BECKETT>So Vivien suspects that Emilio is a cheater.

814
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,950
<27-17,BECKETT>她拿到了他的验尸报告
<27-17,BECKETT>She gets ahold of his autopsy file,

815
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,850
<27-17,BECKETT>开始想他可能是因为外遇被杀的
<27-17,BECKETT>Starts thinking that maybe his cheating got him killed,

816
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,680
<27-17,BECKETT>然后她开始做一些循例调查
<27-17,BECKETT>And she starts doing her usual research

817
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,000
<27-17,BECKETT>去证明她的想法
<27-17,BECKETT>To prove her theory.

818
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,940
<27-17,BECKETT>所有的调查结果都将怀疑
<27-17,BECKETT>And all of this investigation leads her right back

819
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,480
<27-17,BECKETT>指向了尼克·约翰斯顿
<27-17,BECKETT>To Nick Johnston.

820
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,210
<27-18,CASTLE>她想通了所有的事
<27-18,CASTLE>She had it all worked out...

821
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,520
<27-18,CASTLE>直到那个尴尬时刻
<27-18,CASTLE>Right up until that awkward moment

822
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,770
<27-18,CASTLE>尼克·约翰斯顿用碎冰锥
<27-18,CASTLE>Where Nick Johnston stabbed her

823
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,540
<27-18,CASTLE>刺穿了她的脖子
<27-18,CASTLE>in the neck with an ice pick

824
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,690
<27-18,CASTLE>将她扔进沙发
<27-18,CASTLE>And fed her to the couch.

825
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,130
<28-1,NICK JOHNSTON>你们抓错人了  我没有杀那个灵媒
<28-1,NICK JOHNSTON>You got the wrong guy. I didn't kill that psychic.

826
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,500
<28-2,BECKETT>我们知道她找过你
<28-2,BECKETT>We know she came to see you.

827
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,570
<28-3,NICK>没错  她说要私下跟我谈谈
<28-3,NICK>Yeah, she said she needed to talk to me in private,

828
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,620
<28-3,NICK>说很紧急  有关我的妻子
<28-3,NICK>Said it was urgent, had something to do with my wife,

829
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,080
<28-3,NICK>所以我提前打卡下班
<28-3,NICK>So I punched out early and

830
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,380
<28-3,NICK>去了她住宅区的办公室
<28-3,NICK>went uptown to her office.

831
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,300
<28-4,BECKETT>那你到了之后做了什么
<28-4,BECKETT>And what did you do when you got there?

832
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,880
<28-5,NICK>什么都没做  门是锁上的
<28-5,NICK>Nothing. The door was locked.

833
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,970
<28-5,NICK>我敲了十分钟的门  没人开
<28-5,NICK>I pounded on it for ten minutes. Nobody answered.

834
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,210
<28-5,NICK>我以为她放我鸽子  所以就回家了
<28-5,NICK>I figured she was blowing me off, so I went home.

835
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,580
<28-6,BECKETT>这故事相当合理
<28-6,BECKETT>That's a pretty convenient story.

836
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,150
<28-7,NICK>这是事实
<28-7,NICK>It's the truth.

837
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,590
<28-8,BECKETT>好的  不如我们开始聊一下埃米利奥·卡西利亚斯
<28-8,BECKETT>Okay. Why don't we start talking about Emilio Casillas?

838
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,370
<28-9,NICK>说些什么
<28-9,NICK>What about him?

839
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,130
<28-10,BECKETT>你知道他跟你妻子有一腿
<28-10,BECKETT>You knew that he was sleeping with your wife.

840
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,790
<28-11,NICK>他们以为自己很小心
<28-11,NICK>They thought they were being so careful,

841
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,870
<28-11,NICK>但是没错  我知道了
<28-11,NICK>but yeah, I knew.

842
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,110
<28-12,BECKETT>-你做了什么  -什么都没做
<28-12,BECKETT>- So what did you do? - Nothing.

843
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,730
<28-13,NICK>别开玩笑  尼克
<28-13,NICK>Seriously, Nick?

844
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,550
<28-14,BECKETT>你居然期望我相信
<28-14,BECKETT>Do you actually expect me to believe

845
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,110
<28-14,BECKETT>你只是坐在一边  让你的老板
<28-14,BECKETT>That you just sat by and let your boss

846
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,550
<28-14,BECKETT>从你那抢走你的妻子
<28-14,BECKETT>Take your wife away from you?

847
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,010
<28-15,CASTLE>-你认为我有那么笨吗  -她没那么笨
<28-15,CASTLE>- Do you think I'm that dumb? - She's not that dumb.

848
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,250
<28-16,NICK>我想这不重要了
<28-16,NICK>I guess it doesn't matter now.

849
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,960
<28-16,NICK>我
<28-16,NICK>I...

850
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,740
<28-16,NICK>我发现了以后  我去找埃米利奥
<28-16,NICK>When I found out, I went to Emilio

851
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,850
<28-16,NICK>叫他别再跟我老婆见面
<28-16,NICK>And I asked him to stop seeing her.

852
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,610
<28-17,CASTLE>-然后怎么了  -他不肯
<28-17,CASTLE>- and what happened? - He said no.

853
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,060
<28-17,CASTLE>他跟我老婆是相爱的
<28-17,CASTLE>He was in love with her.

854
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,160
<28-18,NICK>我威胁要告诉他妻子
<28-18,NICK>I threatened to tell his wife,

855
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,930
<28-18,NICK>但他只是说  做你该做的吧
<28-18,NICK>And he just said, "Do what you gotta do."

856
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,900
<28-18,NICK>我决定我不会替他做这卑劣的事
<28-18,NICK>So I decided that I wasn't gonna do his dirty work for him.

857
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,500
<28-18,NICK>如果他想离开他三十年的妻子
<28-18,NICK>If he wanted to leave his wife of 30 years,

858
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,430
<28-18,NICK>那么他应该像个男人  自己去做
<28-18,NICK>Then he should just be a man and do it himself.

859
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,700
<28-18,NICK>但我想挽救我的婚姻
<28-18,NICK>But I wanted to save my marriage,

860
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,500
<28-18,NICK>所以我对这事绝口不提
<28-18,NICK>So I kept my mouth shut.

861
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,320
<28-18,NICK>两周后  埃米利奥就死了
<28-18,NICK>Two weeks later, Emilio was dead.

862
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,230
<28-19,BECKETT>而且他的死并不是拜你所赐
<28-19,BECKETT>And you did nothing to help that along,

863
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,540
<28-19,BECKETT>你是这个意思吗
<28-19,BECKETT>Is that what you're saying?

864
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,860
<28-20,NICK>拜我所赐什么啊  他心脏病发作
<28-20,NICK>Help what along? He had a heart attack.

865
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,640
<28-20,NICK>当一个谎话连篇  偷情的混蛋的压力
<28-20,NICK>The stress of being a lying, cheating as shat

866
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,540
<28-20,NICK>终于令他倒下了
<28-20,NICK>Finally did him in.

867
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,250
<28-21,RYAN>佩妮·马查德来了  她说这很紧急
<28-21,RYAN>Penny Marchand is here. She says it's urgent.

868
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,760
<29-1,BECKETT>佩妮  什么事
<29-1,BECKETT>Penny, what is it?

869
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,550
<29-2,PENNY>探长  我有很重要的事要告诉你
<29-2,PENNY>Detective, I have something important to tell you.

870
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,760
<29-3,BECKETT>噢  佩妮  这是关于那个神秘男子吗
<29-3,BECKETT>Oh, Penny, is this about the mystery man?

871
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,060
<29-3,BECKETT>因为我真的不认识任何亚历山大
<29-3,BECKETT>Because I really don't know any Alexander.

872
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,330
<29-5,BECKETT>-亚历山大  -没错  我等一下再告诉你
<29-5,BECKETT>-Alexander? - Yeah, I'll tell you about it later.

873
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,940
<29-5,BECKETT>佩妮  我正在调查一个非常重要的
<29-5,BECKETT>Penny, I'm in the middle of a very important--

874
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,610
<29-6,PENNY>探长  你要听我说
<29-6,PENNY>Detective, you have to listen to me.

875
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,190
<29-6,PENNY>我知道谁杀了我妈妈
<29-6,PENNY>I know who murdered my mother.

876
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,360
<30-1,BECKETT>先让我
<30-1,BECKETT>So let me just...

877
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,240
<30-1,BECKETT>搞清楚
<30-1,BECKETT>Get this straight.

878
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,100
<30-1,BECKETT>你说你做了一个梦
<30-1,BECKETT>You're telling me that you had a dream

879
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,610
<30-1,BECKETT>你妈妈被共济会会员杀了
<30-1,BECKETT>That your mother was murdered by the freemasons.

880
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,680
<30-2,PENNY>在梦里  我们正在共济会的大厅
<30-2,PENNY>In the dream, I was having dinner with my mother

881
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,850
<30-2,PENNY>吃晚饭
<30-2,PENNY>In a masonic hall.

882
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,890
<30-2,PENNY>她非常忧虑
<30-2,PENNY>She was very concerned.

883
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,560
<30-2,PENNY>她不断指着房间里的人
<30-2,PENNY>She kept pointing to men around the room

884
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,940
<30-2,PENNY>说  问那些共济会会员发生什么事
<30-2,PENNY>And saying, "Ask the masons what happened.

885
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,320
<30-2,PENNY>这是你唯一能查出真相的方法了
<30-2,PENNY>That's the only way you'll get closure."

886
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,910
<31-1,BECKETT>进度怎么样  史蒂夫·亚当斯的不在场证明核实了
<31-1,BECKETT>Where are we? Steve Adams alibi checked out.

887
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,130
<31-2,RYAN>那尼克·约翰斯顿呢
<31-2,RYAN>What about Nick Johnston?

888
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,900
<31-3,ESPOSITO>我跟他说不要离开城里
<31-3,ESPOSITO>Well, I told him not to take any trips out of town

889
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,130
<31-4,BECKETT>直到我们把案子解决了
<31-4,BECKETT>Until we get this sorted out.

890
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,350
<31-5,CASTLE>好消息是  有了共济会会员这个线索
<31-5,CASTLE>Well, the good news is, with this freemasons lead,

891
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,440
<31-5,CASTLE>我们有了一批新的嫌疑人
<31-5,CASTLE>We have a whole new crop of suspects.

892
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,320
<31-6,RYAN_ESPOSITO>共济会会员
<31-6,RYAN_ESPOSITO>Freemasons?

893
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
<31-7,BECKETT>别理他
<31-7,BECKETT>ignore him.

894
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,650
<31-8,BECKETT>那么宝拉和玛丽娜·卡西利亚斯
<31-8,BECKETT>So Paula and Marina Casillas...

895
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,480
<31-8,BECKETT>如果他们知道
<31-8,BECKETT>If they knew

896
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,390
<31-8,BECKETT>埃米利奥有外遇  那就会是动机
<31-8,BECKETT>That Emilio was cheating, that would be motive.

897
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,470
<31-9,CASTLE>或者她们发现
<31-9,CASTLE>Maybe they found out that

898
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,970
<31-9,CASTLE>薇薇安正调查他的死
<31-9,CASTLE>Vivien was investigating his death.

899
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,500
<31-10,BECKETT>但她们是薇薇安的客户
<31-10,BECKETT>But they were Vivien's clients.

900
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,110
<31-10,BECKETT>为什么凶手会向一个灵媒寻求慰藉
<31-10,BECKETT>Why would murderers go to a psychic for closure?

901
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,100
<31-11,RYAN>她们还有薇薇安遇害
<31-11,RYAN>They also have an alibi for

902
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,410
<31-11,RYAN>那天的不在场证明
<31-11,RYAN>the evening Vivien was killed.

903
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,870
<31-11,RYAN>制服警员调查了那家
<31-11,RYAN>Uniforms canvassed the restaurant

904
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,040
<31-11,RYAN>她们跟朋友吃饭的餐馆
<31-11,RYAN>Where they were dining with friends.

905
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,690
<31-11,RYAN>她们五点到七点都在餐馆
<31-11,RYAN>They were there from 5:00 p.M. Till after 7:00.

906
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,810
<31-12,BECKETT>那家餐馆离薇薇安的办公室近吗
<31-12,BECKETT>Was this restaurant anywhere near Vivien's office?

907
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,180
<31-13,RYAN>是的  就在转角处  新开的  叫共济餐馆
<31-13,RYAN>Yeah, around the corner. New place. Uh, mason's.

908
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,770
<31-14,CASTLE>求诸共济  他们会给你真相
<31-14,CASTLE>"Ask the masons, and they will give you closure."

909
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,560
<31-15,BECKETT>别神神叨叨的了
<31-15,BECKETT>Let's not get carried away.

910
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,120

<31-21,BECKETT>I have a couple of questions to ask you.

921
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,200
<32-1,BECKETT>卡西利亚斯女士  起初去拜访薇薇安·马查德
<32-1,BECKETT>Mrs. Casillas, whose idea was it to go

922
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,210
<32-1,BECKETT>是谁的主意
<32-1,BECKETT>and visit Vivien Marchand in the first place?

923
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,060
<32-2,PAULA>我们今天过得很糟
<32-2,PAULA>We have had a very long day.

924
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,260
<32-3,BECKETT>请回答问题
<32-3,BECKETT>Please answer the question.

925
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,020
<32-4,MARINA>这是我的主意
<32-4,MARINA>It was my idea.

926
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,880
<32-4,MARINA>妈妈觉得这太贵了
<32-4,MARINA>Mother thought it cost too much,

927
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,710
<32-4,MARINA>但我太想念爸爸了
<32-4,MARINA>But I missed daddy so much that

928
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,120
<32-4,MARINA>什么方法我都会试
<32-4,MARINA>I was willing to try anything.

929
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,030
<32-5,BECKETT>尤其是当她知道
<32-5,BECKETT>And when she knew

930
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,730
<32-5,BECKETT>很多你爸爸的私人资料吗
<32-5,BECKETT>So many private things about your father?

931
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,320
<32-6,MARINA>几乎就像跟他在一起
<32-6,MARINA>It was almost like being with him,

932
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,420
<32-6,MARINA>像他跟我们一起在房间里
<32-6,MARINA>Like he was in the room with us.

933
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,580
<32-7,BECKETT>薇薇安·马查德遇害的那晚
<32-7,BECKETT>The night that Vivien Marchand was murdered,

934
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,410
<32-7,BECKETT>你们两个跟朋友去共济餐馆吃饭
<32-7,BECKETT>The two of you went to dinner with friends at mason's.

935
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,500
<32-8,MARINA>没错  那是新开的
<32-8,MARINA>That's right. It's a new place.

936
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,860
<32-8,MARINA>我妈妈想去试试
<32-8,MARINA>My mother wanted to try it.

937
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,920
<32-9,BECKETT>侍者证实你们五点到七点半
<32-9,BECKETT>The waiter confirmed that you were there

938
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,980
<32-9,BECKETT>都在那儿
<32-9,BECKETT>from 5:00 until 7:30.

939
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,600
<32-9,BECKETT>那顿饭怎么样  你们有叫红酒吗
<32-9,BECKETT>How was your meal? Did you order wine with dinner?

940
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,340
<32-9,BECKETT>是的
<32-9,BECKETT>Yes.

941
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,070
<32-10,MARINA>不  我是说  他们还没有卖酒执照
<32-10,MARINA>No, I mean, they don't have a liquor license yet,

942
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,520
<32-10,MARINA>所以要自己带
<32-10,MARINA>So you bring your own.

943
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,460
<32-11,BECKETT>那么是你们自己带了红酒去
<32-11,BECKETT>So you brought your own bottle of wine with you, then?

944
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,190
<32-11,BECKETT>不
<32-11,BECKETT>No.

945
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,490
<32-12,MARINA>妈妈特地去
<32-12,MARINA>Mother went out to the

946
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,100
<32-12,MARINA>烟酒商店里买回来的
<32-12,MARINA>liquor store and brought us a bottle.

947
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,690
<32-12,MARINA>她去了大概二十分钟
<32-12,MARINA>She was gone about 20 minutes.

948
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,110
<32-13,BECKETT>那是什么时候
<32-13,BECKETT>And what time was that?

949
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,570
<32-14,MARINA>可能是十五分  问这些干什么
<32-14,MARINA>15 maybe. What's this all about?

950
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,190
<32-15,BECKETT>宝拉  我们去了那家贩酒店
<32-15,BECKETT>Paula, we went to the liquor store.

951
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,110
<32-15,BECKETT>那酒不是五点十五分的时候买的
<32-15,BECKETT>You didn't buy that bottle of wine at 5:15.

952
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,980
<32-15,BECKETT>根据这张收据  你在三点十二分买的
<32-15,BECKETT>According to this receipt, you bought it at 3:12.

953
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,290
<32-15,BECKETT>同时你还买了冰锥
<32-15,BECKETT>And at the same time, you bought an ice pick.

954
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,750
<32-16,MARINA>我不明白
<32-16,MARINA>I don't understand.

955
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,850
<32-17,BECKETT>你买了那瓶酒之后
<32-17,BECKETT>You bought that bottle of wine,

956
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,090
<32-17,BECKETT>把它放在一边
<32-17,BECKETT>and then you put it aside,

957
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,830
<32-17,BECKETT>五点十五分的时候
<32-17,BECKETT>And then at 5:15,

958
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,950
<32-17,BECKETT>你离开餐馆
<32-17,BECKETT>You left the restaurant and

959
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,360
<32-17,BECKETT>直接去了薇薇安的办公室
<32-17,BECKETT>went straight to Vivien's office

960
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,450
<32-17,BECKETT>杀了她
<32-17,BECKETT>and murdered her.

961
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,000
<32-18,CASTLE>然后你拿回那瓶酒
<32-18,CASTLE>Then you went and you retrieved the bottle of wine.

962
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,730
<32-18,CASTLE>回到餐馆
<32-18,CASTLE>You returned to the restaurant.

963
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,020
<32-18,CASTLE>继续跟女儿和朋友一起吃饭
<32-18,CASTLE>You had dinner with your daughter and your friends.

964
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,910
<32-19,MARINA>这太荒唐了  妈妈  告诉他们
<32-19,MARINA>that's crazy. Mom, tell them.

965
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,040
<32-20,MARINA>她为什么要这样做
<32-20,MARINA>Why would she do something like that?

966
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,290
<32-21,CASTLE>去掩盖另一起谋杀
<32-21,CASTLE>To cover up another murder.

967
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,290
<32-21,CASTLE>你的父亲
<32-21,CASTLE>Your father's.

968
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,980
<32-22,BECKETT>是你发现埃米利奥在偷情
<32-22,BECKETT>Did you figure out that Emilio was cheating

969
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,950
<32-22,BECKETT>还是他告诉你的
<32-22,BECKETT>Or did he tell you?

970
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,890
<32-23,PAULA>他跟我说
<32-23,PAULA>He told me...

971
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,860
<32-23,PAULA>他遇到一个人
<32-23,PAULA>That he had met someone...

972
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,790
<32-23,PAULA>说那女人年轻漂亮
<32-23,PAULA>That she was young and beautiful...

973
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,260
<32-23,PAULA>而我只是残花败柳
<32-23,PAULA>And that I was just a boring old lady.

974
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,770
<32-24,PAULA>我从工厂拿了些硒
<32-24,PAULA>I took some selenium from the factory,

975
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,970
<32-24,PAULA>然后  每天早上
<32-24,PAULA>And... Every morning,

976
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,910
<32-24,PAULA>我都加一点在他的咖啡里
<32-24,PAULA>I put a little bit in his coffee.

977
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,980
<32-25,MARINA>噢  我的天  妈
<32-25,MARINA>Oh, my god. Mom...

978
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,410
<32-26,PAULA>你想去见薇薇安的时候
<32-26,PAULA>When you wanted to go see Vivien,

979
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,880
<32-26,PAULA>我为了令你高兴也去了
<32-26,PAULA>I went along to humor you,

980
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,880
<32-26,PAULA>但是  她知道了
<32-26,PAULA>But... She knew things

981
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,290
<32-26,PAULA>她不该知道的事
<32-26,PAULA>That she shouldn't have known.

982
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,220
<32-27,BECKETT>然后当她要说埃米利奥
<32-27,BECKETT>And then when she told you that Emilio wanted

983
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,320
<32-27,BECKETT>有重要的事想告诉你
<32-27,BECKETT>To tell you something important...

984
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,590
<32-28,CASTLE>她打算在晚上
<32-28,CASTLE>And she said she was going to spend the evening

985
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,560
<32-28,CASTLE>和他的灵魂沟通
<32-28,CASTLE>Communing with his spirit...

986
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,300
<32-29,PAULA>在他做了那些事以后
<32-29,PAULA>The cheating son of a bitch was gonna tell on me.

987
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,930
<32-29,PAULA>那个偷情的混蛋要揭发我
<32-29,PAULA>After everything that he had done,

988
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,070
<32-29,PAULA>我不能让这发生
<32-29,PAULA>I couldn't let that happen.

989
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,830
<32-29,PAULA>我必须杀了她而阻止他
<32-29,PAULA>I had to kill her to stop him.

990
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,090
<32-30,MARINA>妈妈  别说了
<32-30,MARINA>Mother, stop talking.

991
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,680
<32-30,MARINA>我们需要律师
<32-30,MARINA>We want a lawyer.

992
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,850
<33-1,BECKETT>宝拉·卡西利亚斯的律师来了
<33-1,BECKETT>Paula Casillas has lawyered up.

993
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,640
<33-1,BECKETT>他已经开始试着制止她招供了
<33-1,BECKETT>He's already trying to suppress her confession.

994
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,990
<33-2,CASTLE>会有用吗
<33-2,CASTLE>Will that work?

995
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,550
<33-3,BECKETT>这点我怀疑  但宝拉已经不说话了
<33-3,BECKETT>You know, I doubt it, but Paula's done talking.

996
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,490
<33-4,CASTLE>你有问她是谁写了那封信吗
<33-4,CASTLE>Did you ask her who wrote the letter?

997
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,690
<33-5,BECKETT>你知道的  我没机会问
<33-5,BECKETT>You know, I didn't get a chance,

998
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,420
<33-5,BECKETT>那么我猜这依然是一个谜了
<33-5,BECKETT>So I guess it'll have to remain a mystery.

999
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,930
<33-6,CASTLE>呃  实际上并不全是
<33-6,CASTLE>Uh, actually, not quite.

1000
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,060
<33-6,CASTLE>你记得上一个线索
<33-6,CASTLE>Do you remember the last clue,

1001
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,770
<33-6,CASTLE>-那个从远处传来的敲门声吗  -嗯
<33-6,CASTLE>- The sound of knocking from far away? - Mm-hmm.

1002
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,170
<33-6,CASTLE>那应该是尼克·约翰斯顿
<33-6,CASTLE>That would've been Nick Johnston.

1003
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,910
<33-6,CASTLE>他说他敲了几分钟的门
<33-6,CASTLE>He said he pounded on that door for quite some time

1004
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,390
<33-6,CASTLE>然后才放弃回家
<33-6,CASTLE>Before he finally gave up and went away.

1005
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,360
<33-6,CASTLE>薇薇安那时候已经死了
<33-6,CASTLE>Vivien was already dead.

1006
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,780
<33-7,BECKETT>没错  但宝拉可能还在办公室
<33-7,BECKETT>Yeah, but Paula could've still been in the office

1007
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,850
<33-7,BECKETT>等着他走
<33-7,BECKETT>Waiting for him to leave,

1008
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,230
<33-7,BECKETT>她有可能听到敲门声
<33-7,BECKETT>she would've heard the knocking

1009
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,760
<33-7,BECKETT>就像她看见那个电话
<33-7,BECKETT>Just like she saw the phone,

1010
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,930
<33-7,BECKETT>看见艾伯特·莫雷诺
<33-7,BECKETT>just like she saw Albert Moreno,

1011
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,160
<33-7,BECKETT>穿着黑色的衣服
<33-7,BECKETT>Who was probably dressed in black,

1012
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,620
<33-7,BECKETT>所以她只是把这些写进信里误导我们
<33-7,BECKETT>So she just put it into the letter to throw us off. Hmm.

1013
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,660
<33-8,CASTLE>但根据你谋杀板上的时间表
<33-8,CASTLE>Only according to your timeline on the murder board,

1014
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,540
<33-8,CASTLE>尼克五点四十五分到办公室的时候
<33-8,CASTLE>By the time Nick got to the office at 5:45,

1015
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,760
<33-8,CASTLE>宝拉已经回到餐馆了
<33-8,CASTLE>Paula was back at the restaurant,

1016
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,860
<33-8,CASTLE>办公室是空的
<33-8,CASTLE>So the office was empty,

1017
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,360
<33-8,CASTLE>除非  当然了  还有薇薇安
<33-8,CASTLE>Except, of course, for Vivien.

1018
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,690
<33-9,CASTLE>噢  趁我还没忘记
<33-9,CASTLE>Oh, before I forget...

1019
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,060
<33-9,CASTLE>佩妮说了亚历山大什么
<33-9,CASTLE>What did Penny say about Alexander?

1020
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,630
<33-10,BECKETT>噢  没什么
<33-10,BECKETT>Oh, nothing.

1021
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,060
<33-10,BECKETT>只是些毫无意义的瞎话罢了
<33-10,BECKETT>Just some silly stuff that didn't really make any sense.

1022
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:10,680
<33-10,BECKETT>怎么了
<33-10,BECKETT>Why?

1023
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,630
<33-11,CASTLE>因为我的中间名就是亚历山大
<33-11,CASTLE>Because my middle name is Alexander.

1024
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,450
<33-12,BECKETT>我以为你的中间名是埃德加
<33-12,BECKETT>I thought your middle name was Edgar.

1025
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,290
<33-13,CASTLE>又去看过了我网站上的
<33-13,CASTLE>Been perusing the personal section

1026
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,160
<33-13,CASTLE>个人资料了吧
<33-13,CASTLE>of the Richard Castle website again, have we?

1027
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,520
<33-13,CASTLE>不  我因为埃德加·爱伦·坡
<33-13,CASTLE>No, I changed my middle name to Edgar

1028
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,580
<33-13,CASTLE>把中间名改成了埃德加
<33-13,CASTLE>for Edgar Allan Poe

1029
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,230
<33-13,CASTLE>同时我把姓改成了卡塞尔
<33-13,CASTLE>back when I changed my last name to Castle.

1030
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,050
<33-13,CASTLE>我本名是理查德·亚历山大·罗杰斯
<33-13,CASTLE>My given name is Richard Alexander Rodgers.

1031
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,200
<33-13,CASTLE>太巧了  是不
<33-13,CASTLE>What a coincidence, huh?

1032
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,520
<34-1,CASTLE>我觉得他们待客十分周到
<34-1,CASTLE>I think that was a lovely service.

1033
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,580
<34-1,CASTLE>如果要我说
<34-1,CASTLE>And if I may say,

1034
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,290
<34-1,CASTLE>你的演讲是最棒的
<34-1,CASTLE>Your speech was the best.

1035
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,080
<34-2,MARTHA>噢  谢谢你给我写的稿
<34-2,MARTHA>Oh, well, thank you for writing it. Pfft.

1036
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,800
<34-2,MARTHA>而且我觉得吧  你别和别人说啊
<34-2,MARTHA>And I think, you know, between the two of us,

1037
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,860
<34-2,MARTHA>我们成功描述了切特的神髓
<34-2,MARTHA>We managed to capture the essence of Chet.

1038
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,360
<34-3,CASTLE>是的
<34-3,CASTLE>Yes.

1039
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,790
<34-4,MARTHA>还有博莫和洛蒂
<34-4,MARTHA>And Boom and Lotte--

1040
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,450
<34-4,MARTHA>非常 非常感激地要回了戒指
<34-4,MARTHA>Very, very gracious about taking the ring back

1041
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,780
<34-4,MARTHA>还有所有的  噢
<34-4,MARTHA>And the whole... Oh.

1042
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,400
<34-5,MARTHA>噢  我的天  我感觉太糟糕了
<34-5,MARTHA>Oh, god. I feel terrible.

1043
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,490
<34-5,MARTHA>听我说
<34-5,MARTHA>You know...

1044
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,850
<34-6,CASTLE>你真的不需要感到内疚
<34-6,CASTLE>You really have nothing to feel guilty about.

1045
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,260
<34-7,MARTHA>噢  理查德  别这样  不
<34-7,MARTHA>Oh, Richard, please. No, if anything,

1046
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,710
<34-8,CASTLE>如果你告诉了切特
<34-8,CASTLE>By telling Chet you wanted to

1047
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,440
<34-8,CASTLE>你想和他订婚
<34-8,CASTLE>think about getting engaged,

1048
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,750
<34-8,CASTLE>你给了他多一天的希望
<34-8,CASTLE>You gave him one more day of hope.

1049
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,100
<34-9,MARTHA>但现在他知道了
<34-9,MARTHA>But now he knows.

1050
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,270
<34-9,MARTHA>他就在上面  我觉得
<34-9,MARTHA>He's up there, I assume,

1051
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,370
<34-9,MARTHA>他什么都知道了
<34-9,MARTHA>And he knows everything.

1052
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,800
<34-9,MARTHA>他知道把他的真心给了一个肤浅
<34-9,MARTHA>He knows he gave his heart to a woman who is shallow

1053
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,460
<34-9,MARTHA>有点懦弱  而且
<34-9,MARTHA>And a little cowardly and...

1054
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,380
<34-9,MARTHA>配不上他的女人
<34-9,MARTHA>Didn't really deserve him.

1055
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,770
<34-11,MARTHA>-干嘛  -过来这里
<34-11,MARTHA>- What? - Come here.

<34-12,CASTLE>- Oh, honey. I-I don't have-- - no, go.

1057
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,090
<34-14,CASTLE>现在你可以问切特任何事
<34-14,CASTLE>Now you can ask Chet anything you want to know.

1058
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,040
<34-15,MARTHA>亲爱的  你会原谅我吗
<34-15,MARTHA>Darling, do you forgive me?

<34-18,CASTLE>And let me tell you something else.

1063
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,890
<34-18,CASTLE>切特又不是傻瓜
<34-18,CASTLE>Chet was nobody's fool.

1064
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,370
<34-18,CASTLE>他了解你的一切
<34-18,CASTLE>He knew you, all of you.

1065
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,460
<34-18,CASTLE>而且他爱你
<34-18,CASTLE>And he loved you.

1066
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,450
<34-18,CASTLE>我相信不管他现在在那里  他仍爱着你
<34-18,CASTLE>I am sure wherever he is now, he still does.

1067
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,800
<34-18,CASTLE>过来
<34-18,CASTLE>Come on.

<34-20,MARTHA>Whatever mistakes I've made in my life,

1072
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,600
