32
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,960
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>大杯泡沫无糖香草脱脂拿铁
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Grande skim latte, two pumps sugar-free vanilla.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>知我者  卡塞尔也
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>Castle, I think you read my mind.

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,210
<1-3,CASTLE>手术伤口疼吗
<1-3,CASTLE>Surgery?

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,450
<1-3,CASTLE>对
<1-3,CASTLE>Yeah.

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,660
<1-4,BECKETT>有时疤会有点紧
<1-4,BECKETT>Sometimes the scar pulls a bit.

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,370
<1-5,CASTLE>那天的事你还是什么都记不得吗
<1-5,CASTLE>And you still don't remember anything about that day?

38
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,950
<1-6,BECKETT>完全记不得
<1-6,BECKETT>No. It's a blank.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,200
<2-1,CASTLE>真想不到今秋水泥大衣又回潮了
<2-1,CASTLE>Who knew cement overcoats would be back for fall?

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,460
<2-2,LANIE PARISH>我得先手动凿开混凝土才能做尸检
<2-2,LANIE PARISH>I need to chisel out the concrete by hand before I can autopsy,

41
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,340
<2-2,LANIE PARISH>但她死于枪击  这毫无疑问
<2-2,LANIE PARISH>but it's pretty clear she was shot to death.

42
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,810
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>在泥土里找到了两枚子弹
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>Found these two slugs in the dirt.

43
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,320
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>貌似是九毫米口径的
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>Looks to be a 9-millimeter.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,540
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>凶手很专业
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>Guy was a pro.

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,890
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>双枪夺命
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>Double tap.

46
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,660
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>一枪击中脑后  她倒下
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>One in the back of the head, she falls,

47
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,660
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>再开一枪以防万一
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>then he hits her again to make sure.

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,790
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>再把她埋在沙子里
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>Buries her in the sand.

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,440
<2-4,BECKETT>只等着水泥车
<2-4,BECKETT>And then waits for the cement truck

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,670
<2-4,BECKETT>早上来完成毁尸灭迹
<2-4,BECKETT>to come in in the morning to finish off the job.

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,190
<2-5,CASTLE>处决型凶杀  水泥车
<2-5,CASTLE>Execution-style murder, cement trucks--

52
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,430
<2-5,CASTLE>有没有人觉得像是黑帮刺杀
<2-5,CASTLE>Can anyone else say mob hit?

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,400
<2-5,CASTLE>这里可有"坚实"的证据啊
<2-5,CASTLE>I'm looking at concrete evidence right here.

54
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,150
<2-6,BECKETT>包是这里面找到的吗
<2-6,BECKETT>Is that purse from in here?

55
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,010
<2-7,RYAN>对  她的皮尔斯大学学生证上
<2-7,RYAN>Yeah. According to her Pearce College I.D.,

56
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,780
<2-7,RYAN>写着死者名叫简·赫茨菲尔德
<2-7,RYAN>our victim's name is Jane Herzfeld.

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,470
<2-8,BECKETT>大学生
<2-8,BECKETT>A college student?

58
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,160
<2-8,BECKETT>倒是不像黑帮会杀的人
<2-8,BECKETT>That's not a typical mob victim.

59
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,700
<3-1,RYAN>我请弹道分析科的人帮忙
<3-1,RYAN>Called in a favor to ballistics.

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,970
<3-1,RYAN>今天应该就能拿到结果了
<3-1,RYAN>We should get results today.

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,560
<3-1,RYAN>你找到她亲属了吗
<3-1,RYAN>Did you reach the next of kin?

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,780
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她妈妈正在赶来
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Her mother's on her way in.

63
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,410
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>简是独生女
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Jane was an only child.

64
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,980
<3-3,RYAN>那太惨了
<3-3,RYAN>That's a hell of a thing.

65
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,590
<3-3,RYAN>是啊
<3-3,RYAN>Yeah.

66
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,430
<3-4,ESPOSITO>她还有个室友
<3-4,ESPOSITO>She also had a roommate--

67
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,810
<3-4,ESPOSITO>去密歇根探亲了  不过她明天就回来
<3-4,ESPOSITO>in Michigan visiting her folks, but she's back tomorrow.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,650
<3-5,RYAN>她做了什么事  会被人弃尸阴沟
<3-5,RYAN>What was this girl into that got her dumped into a ditch?

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,760
<3-6,ESPOSITO>目前看来
<3-6,ESPOSITO>As far as I can tell,

70
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,100
<3-6,ESPOSITO>她做了家教
<3-6,ESPOSITO>all she was into was tutoring other students.

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,200
<3-6,ESPOSITO>她死的当天行程安排的满满的
<3-6,ESPOSITO>She was booked solid for the day she died.

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,320
<3-6,ESPOSITO>奇怪的是那天早晨她取消了所有约会
<3-6,ESPOSITO>What's weird is that she canceled her appointments that morning.

73
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,600
<3-6,ESPOSITO>她的学生说这不是她的作风
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Her students say that it wasn't like her.

74
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,250
<3-6,ESPOSITO>她是超级尽责的人
<3-6,ESPOSITO>She was super conscientious.

75
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,600
<3-7,RYAN>她有给出取消的理由吗
<3-7,RYAN>Did she tell them why she was canceling?

76
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
<3-8,ESPOSITO>她只说有重要的事
<3-8,ESPOSITO>All she said was, something important had come up.

77
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,410
<3-9,RYAN>或许她知道自己身陷麻烦
<3-9,RYAN>Maybe she knew she was in trouble.

78
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,640
<4-1,LANIE>死亡时间约在晚十点到午夜间
<4-1,LANIE>I'm putting the time of death between 10:00 and 12 midnight.

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,530
<4-1,LANIE>我还找到了这个
<4-1,LANIE>And I found this...

80
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,130
<4-1,LANIE>瘀伤
<4-1,LANIE>Bruising,

81
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,630
<4-1,LANIE>不到一天前造成的
<4-1,LANIE>no more than a day old.

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,470
<4-2,CASTLE>他肯定抓住了她  或许是强迫她上车
<4-2,CASTLE>He must have grabbed her, maybe forced her into a car?

83
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,850
<4-3,LANIE>而且  我在她的衬衫上找到了可卡因残留物
<4-3,LANIE>Also, I found traces of cocaine residue on her shirt,

84
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,580
<4-3,LANIE>但初步毒理检查却毫无发现
<4-3,LANIE>but the preliminary tox is clean.

85
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,510
<4-3,LANIE>她体内没有毒品也没有酒精
<4-3,LANIE>No drugs or alcohol in her system.

86
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,070
<4-4,CASTLE>或许是凶手带她走到凶杀现场期间
<4-4,CASTLE>The killer could've transferred it to her shirt

87
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,730
<4-4,CASTLE>弄到她衬衫上的
<4-4,CASTLE>when he walked her to the murder site.

88
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,810
<4-5,LANIE>看起来
<4-5,LANIE>From the looks of it...

89
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,520
<4-5,LANIE>她知道自己在劫难逃
<4-5,LANIE>she knew she was gonna die.

90
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,730
<4-5,LANIE>她拳头里紧握着这个
<4-5,LANIE>I found this clutched in her fist.

91
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,520
<4-6,CASTLE>他让她祈祷  然后杀了她
<4-6,CASTLE>He let her say a prayer before he shot her.

92
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,150
<4-6,CASTLE>这可不够专业啊
<4-6,CASTLE>That's not very professional.

93
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,690
<4-6,CASTLE>不
<4-6,CASTLE>No.

94
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,670
<4-7,BECKETT>看来简认识凶手
<4-7,BECKETT>More like Jane knew her killer.

95
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,080
<5-1,MRS HERZFELD>昨晚她没打电话来
<5-1,MRS HERZFELD>When I didn't hear from her last night,

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,610
<5-1,MRS HERZFELD>我就知道出事了
<5-1,MRS HERZFELD>I knew something was wrong.

97
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,610
<5-1,MRS HERZFELD>我们每晚都会通话的
<5-1,MRS HERZFELD>We always talked at the end of the day.

98
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,450
<5-2,BECKETT>赫茨菲尔德太太  简为了赚外快做家教
<5-2,BECKETT>Mrs. Herzfeld, Jane was tutoring people to make extra cash.

99
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,160
<5-2,BECKETT>你知道她昨天为什么取消了全部约会吗
<5-2,BECKETT>Do you know why she canceled all of her appointments yesterday?

100
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,910
<5-3,CASTLE>有没有可能  简除了家教还做了别的什么
<5-3,CASTLE>Is it possible that Jane was doing something other than tutoring,

101
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,680
<5-3,CASTLE>可能让她卷入麻烦的事
<5-3,CASTLE>something that might have gotten her into trouble?

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,620
<5-4,MRS HERZFELD>什么样的事
<5-4,MRS HERZFELD>Something like what?

103
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,950
<5-5,BECKETT>我们在她体内没有发现毒品
<5-5,BECKETT>Look, we didn't find any drugs in Jane's system,

104
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,810
<5-5,BECKETT>但法医在她衣服上找到了一些可卡因
<5-5,BECKETT>but the M.E. did find traces of cocaine on her clothes.

105
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,210
<5-6,MRS HERZFELD>简绝不会跟毒品弄到一块
<5-6,MRS HERZFELD>Jane would never be involved with drugs!

106
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,900
<5-7,BECKETT>没错  但她可能跟与毒品有关的人弄到一块了
<5-7,BECKETT>Yeah, but she might have been involved with people who were.

107
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,640
<5-7,BECKETT>我们认为她认识凶手
<5-7,BECKETT>And we think that she knew her killer.

108
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,300
<5-8,MRS HERZFELD>她有个男友我不喜欢
<5-8,MRS HERZFELD>There was a boyfriend I didn't like.

109
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,200
<5-8,MRS HERZFELD>他们五个月前分手了
<5-8,MRS HERZFELD>They broke up five months ago.

110
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,350
<5-9,BECKETT>你为什么不喜欢他
<5-9,BECKETT>And what did you not like about him?

111
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,890
<5-10,MRS HERZFELD>他不直视我的眼睛
<5-10,MRS HERZFELD>He wouldn't meet my eye.

112
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,670
<5-10,MRS HERZFELD>他们吵架
<5-10,MRS HERZFELD>They would fight.

113
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,850
<5-10,MRS HERZFELD>我看到她身上有瘀伤
<5-10,MRS HERZFELD>I saw bruises on her.

114
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,920
<5-11,BECKETT>你记得他的名字吗
<5-11,BECKETT>Do you remember his name?

115
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,780
<6-1,RYAN>芬巴尔·乔瑟夫·麦奎恩
<6-1,RYAN>Finbar Joseph McQueen,

116
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,120
<6-1,RYAN>也叫芬恩
<6-1,RYAN>A.K.A. Finn.

117
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,460
<6-1,RYAN>因携带可卡因并有意贩卖入狱两年
<6-1,RYAN>Did a deuce on cocaine charges, possession with intent.

118
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,130
<6-2,BECKETT>这就能解释蕾妮在尸体上找到的残留物了
<6-2,BECKETT>Well, that could explain the residue Lanie found on her body.

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,990
<6-3,CASTLE>破门侵入  袭击他人
<6-3,CASTLE>B&E, simple assault...

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
<6-3,CASTLE>没有跟枪有关的犯罪
<6-3,CASTLE>There's nothing gun related.

121
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
<6-4,BECKETT>或许他决心更上一层楼
<6-4,BECKETT>Maybe he decided to step up the game.

122
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,110
<6-4,BECKETT>查到他的住址了吗
<6-4,BECKETT>Do we have a location on this guy?

123
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,330
<6-5,RYAN>查到了  这才是最好的部分呢
<6-5,RYAN>Yeah, that's the best part.

124
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,670
<6-5,RYAN>我们跟麦奎恩的假释官谈过
<6-5,RYAN>Talked to McQueen's parole officer.

125
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,250
<6-5,RYAN>他说麦奎恩在西98街645号干活
<6-5,RYAN>He says that McQueen is doing a job at 645 W. 98th street.

126
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,200
<6-5,RYAN>做建筑工人
<6-5,RYAN>Construction.

127
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,130
<7-1,FINN>真不敢相信
<7-1,FINN>I can't believe it.

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,950
<7-1,FINN>真不敢相信她死了
<7-1,FINN>I can't believe she's dead.

129
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,120
<7-2,RYAN>你最后一次见到简是什么时候
<7-2,RYAN>When is the last time you saw Jane?

130
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,120
<7-3,FINN>几周前
<7-3,FINN>A couple weeks ago.

131
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,690
<7-3,FINN>但你们四月份就分手了
<7-3,FINN>But you--you broke up in April,

132
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,510
<8-1,ESPOSITO>这么说  你们还有联系吗
<8-1,ESPOSITO>so... you stayed in touch?

133
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,640
<8-2,FINN>我们是朋友  对啊  我
<8-2,FINN>Uh, I-I was her friend, yeah. I...

134
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,000
<8-2,FINN>我时不时会帮帮她  我
<8-2,FINN>I-I help her out every now and then. I, uh...

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,350
<8-2,FINN>借过她钱  她也还了
<8-2,FINN>L-lent her money once, she paid me back.

136
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,980
<8-2,FINN>就诸如此类的
<8-2,FINN>You know, like-- like that.

137
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,080
<9-1,RYAN>简缺钱吗
<9-1,RYAN>Did Jane have money problems?

138
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,200
<9-2,ESPOSITO>作为她的朋友
<9-2,ESPOSITO>And as a friend...

139
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,100
<9-2,ESPOSITO>或许你跟她说你可以帮她找点事做
<9-2,ESPOSITO>did you maybe tell her that you could hook her up,

140
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,190
<9-2,ESPOSITO>结果让她陷入自己应付不来的事情中
<9-2,ESPOSITO>got her involved in something she couldn't handle?

141
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,370
<9-3,FINN>简绝不会做任何违法的事情...
<9-3,FINN>Jane wouldn't ever do anything that wasn't legit...

142
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,670
<9-3,FINN>-贝克特  -如果你是想暗示这个的话
<9-3,FINN>- Beckett. - if that's what you're implying.

143
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,350
<9-5,FINN>简是个好女孩
<9-5,FINN>Jane was a good girl.

144
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,260
<10-3,ESPOSITO>什么
<10-3,ESPOSITO>What?

145
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,600
<9-5,FINN>所以我们才分手了
<9-5,FINN>That's why it ended with her.

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,420
<9-6,BECKETT>你确定吗
<9-6,BECKETT>Are you sure?

147
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,350
<9-7,FINN>她希望我能金盆洗手
<9-7,FINN>She wanted me to go straight.

148
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,970
<9-8,BECKETT>绝对不会弄错吗
<9-8,BECKETT>And there's no chance that's a mistake?

149
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,920
<9-9,FINN>我就是做不到
<9-9,FINN>I just couldn't.

150
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
<9-10,FINN>我不断跟她说
<9-10,FINN>I kept telling her...

151
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,510
<9-10,FINN>我就是这样的
<9-10,FINN>This is who I am.

152
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,480
<10-1,ESPOSITO>别动
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Don't move.

153
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,830
<10-2,ESPOSITO>那个叫芬恩的家伙
<10-2,ESPOSITO>My man Finn,

154
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,100
<10-2,ESPOSITO>马上就要招供了
<10-2,ESPOSITO>inches from confessing.

155
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,170
<10-3,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<10-3,ESPOSITO>What?

156
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,670
<10-4,RYAN>发生了什么事
<10-4,RYAN>What's going on?

157
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,660
<10-5,BECKETT>弹道分析刚刚出来了
<10-5,BECKETT>Ballistics just came in.

158
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,640
<10-5,BECKETT>杀死简·赫茨菲尔德的子弹是
<10-5,BECKETT>The bullet that killed Jane Herzfeld

159
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,090
<10-5,BECKETT>发自一把我们已有记录的枪支
<10-5,BECKETT>is from a gun that's in our system.

160
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,680
<10-5,BECKETT>格洛克17型
<10-5,BECKETT>It's a Glock 17.

161
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,400
<10-6,ESPOSITO>好消息呀
<10-6,ESPOSITO>That's good news.

162
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,360
<10-7,BECKETT>莱恩  与你以前的配枪匹配
<10-7,BECKETT>Ryan, it's a match to your old service weapon.

163
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,070
<10-8,RYAN>一定出错了吧
<10-8,RYAN>That can't be right.

164
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,160
<10-9,BECKETT>没有出错
<10-9,BECKETT>It's not a mistake.

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,830
<10-9,BECKETT>杀死简·赫茨菲尔德的枪
<10-9,BECKETT>The weapon that killed Jane Herzfeld...

166
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,650
<10-9,BECKETT>是你的那把
<10-9,BECKETT>it's yours.

176
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,610
<11-1,RYAN>她死时手里紧握着十字架
<11-1,RYAN>She was holding a cross in her hand when she died.

177
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,590
<11-1,RYAN>她祈祷着怜悯
<11-1,RYAN>She was praying for mercy.

178
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,320
<11-1,RYAN>然后
<11-1,RYAN>And then...

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,530
<11-1,RYAN>她就听到凶手扣下了
<11-1,RYAN>She heard him pull the trigger...

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,070
<11-1,RYAN>我的枪的扳机
<11-1,RYAN>of my gun.

181
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,970
<12-1,RYAN>去年  我们曾调查3XK连环杀人案
<12-1,RYAN>We were working the 3XK serial murders last year.

182
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,110
<12-1,RYAN>拘捕了一名嫌疑犯  并且他供认罪行
<12-1,RYAN>We had a suspect in custody who had given us a full confession,

183
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,440
<12-1,RYAN>于是  卡塞尔和我去了汽车旅馆
<12-1,RYAN>at which time, Castle and I went to the motel--

184
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,280
<12-2,CAPTAIN GATES>卡塞尔也跟你一起
<12-2,CAPTAIN GATES>Castle was with you?

185
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,060
<12-3,BECKETT>是的  局里把杰端·泰森扣押在
<12-3,BECKETT>Yeah, the NYPD sequestered Jerry Tyson

186
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,290
<12-3,BECKETT>一个汽车旅馆里作为目击证人
<12-3,BECKETT>at a motel as a witness,

187
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,510
<12-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔和莱恩过去告诉他安全了
<12-3,BECKETT>and Castle and Ryan went over there to give him the all clear.

188
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,850
<12-4,GATES>而此时你们意识到泰森才是真正的3XK
<12-4,GATES>At which time you realized that Tyson actually was 3XK?

189
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,610
<12-4,GATES>是的  长官
<12-4,GATES>Yes, sir.

190
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,320
<12-5,RYAN>泰森先发制人
<12-5,RYAN>Tyson got the drop on us

191
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,980
<12-5,RYAN>把我的警徽和配枪都带走了
<12-5,RYAN>and left with my gun and badge.

192
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,440
<12-6,BECKETT>内务处已经证实那不是莱恩警探的错
<12-6,BECKETT>Look, detective Ryan was cleared of all wrongdoing by the I.A.B.

193
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,100
<12-7,GATES>我不在乎是谁犯了错
<12-7,GATES>I don't care whose fault it is.

194
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,560
<12-7,GATES>我只在乎把损害降到最低
<12-7,GATES>All I care about is mitigating the damage,

195
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,280
<12-7,GATES>就是说我们得把杰端·泰森这禽兽尽快找出来
<12-7,GATES>which means we track down Jerry Tyson like the animal he is

196
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,870
<12-7,GATES>然后丢回监狱
<12-7,GATES>and we haul him into custody.

197
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,710
<12-8,BECKETT>是的  长官
<12-8,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

198
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,250
<13-1,CASTLE>你还好吗
<13-1,CASTLE>You okay?

199
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,150
<13-2,RYAN>杰端·泰森被抓的时候我就好了
<13-2,RYAN>I will be when Jerry Tyson's in cuffs.

200
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,050
<13-2,RYAN>贝克特
<13-2,RYAN>Beckett,

201
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,380
<13-3,ESPOSITO>麦奎恩的不在场证明已经证实
<13-3,ESPOSITO>McQueen's alibi checks out.

202
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,200
<13-3,ESPOSITO>服务员说他在东区的安吉莉餐馆
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Waitress confirms he was at Angeli's Diner

203
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,770
<13-3,ESPOSITO>一直待到关门
<13-3,ESPOSITO>on the east side until closing.

204
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,510
<13-4,BECKETT>好吧  放了他
<13-4,BECKETT>All right. Cut him loose.

205
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,030
<13-4,BECKETT>你知道吗  莱恩
<13-4,BECKETT>You know, Ryan,

206
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,610
<13-5,CASTLE>如果泰森就是凶手
<13-5,CASTLE>if Tyson is the shooter,

207
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,870
<13-5,CASTLE>那就解释了简被杀的原因
<13-5,CASTLE>that explains Jane.

208
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,870
<13-5,CASTLE>并没有直接动机  只是符合他的喜好
<13-5,CASTLE>No direct motive, just fits his profile--

209
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,000
<13-5,CASTLE>妙龄金发女郎
<13-5,CASTLE>She's young, she's blonde.

210
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,270
<13-6,BECKETT>没错  但3XK案子其它的死者都是被勒死
<13-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but 3XK strangled those other women.

211
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,710
<13-6,BECKETT>为什么现在他用起枪来了
<13-6,BECKETT>Why would he use a gun now?

212
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,570
<13-7,CASTLE>他说过他喜欢改变作案手法
<13-7,CASTLE>He told me he likes to change up his MO.

213
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,090
<13-8,RYAN>是啊  一定是在我昏倒在地的时候说的
<13-8,RYAN>Yeah. He must have mentioned that when I was out cold on the floor.

214
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,450
<13-9,CASTLE>莱恩  这根本不是你的错
<13-9,CASTLE>You know, Ryan, none of this is your fault.

215
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,080
<13-9,CASTLE>他用了你的配枪这件事...
<13-9,CASTLE>The fact that he used your gun--

216
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,090
<13-10,RYAN>那把枪是由纽约市配发给我的
<13-10,RYAN>That weapon was issued to me by the city of New York.

217
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,200
<13-10,RYAN>我把它弄丢了  现在还有人用它杀了这女孩
<13-10,RYAN>I let it out of my hand, and now a girl is dead.

218
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,700
<13-10,RYAN>请别再说这不是我的错了
<13-10,RYAN>So please do not tell me that it's not my fault.

219
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,600
<13-11,RYAN>我去排查简的公寓
<13-11,RYAN>I'm gonna start a canvass at Jane's apartment,

220
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,100
<13-11,RYAN>让他们把泰森的照片给附近的人看看
<13-11,RYAN>have 'em show Tyson's photo around,

221
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,840
<13-11,RYAN>弄清楚简的室友什么时候回来
<13-11,RYAN>find out when Jane's roommate's back in town.

222
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,660
<13-12,BECKETT>好的
<13-12,BECKETT>Okay.

223
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,330
<13-13,BECKETT>这是警察的心结  卡塞尔
<13-13,BECKETT>It's a cop thing, Castle.

224
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,390
<13-14,CASTLE>不  不  我明白的
<13-14,CASTLE>No. No, I get it.

225
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
<13-15,ESPOSITO>鉴证组从简的一卡通和
<13-15,ESPOSITO>Yo. C.S.U. pulled information

226
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,300
<13-15,ESPOSITO>自动提款机记录里查到信息
<13-15,ESPOSITO>off Jane's metro card and ATM records.

227
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,300
<13-15,ESPOSITO>昨天她在中央车站花了几乎所有的钱
<13-15,ESPOSITO>She spent most of yesterday at Grand Central Station.

228
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,830
<13-16,BECKETT>是的  在四小时内
<13-16,BECKETT>Yeah, over a 4-hour period,

229
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,380
<13-16,BECKETT>她在车站里和附近的三台自动提款机上
<13-16,BECKETT>she made... multiple withdrawals out of three ATMs

230
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,000
<13-16,BECKETT>进行了多次提款
<13-16,BECKETT>in and around the train station--

231
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,100
<13-16,BECKETT>总共八百美元
<13-16,BECKETT>$800 worth.

232
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,480
<13-17,CASTLE>她告假一天
<13-17,CASTLE>So she canceled a day of work

233
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,240
<13-17,CASTLE>就为了在车站闲晃然后挥霍掉所有存款吗
<13-17,CASTLE>to hang out at a train station and empty her bank account?

234
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,510
<13-17,CASTLE>这就是她所谓的重要事件吗
<13-17,CASTLE>That was the important thing that came up?

235
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,940
<13-18,ESPOSITO>我已经在第一时间派了一个小队过去
<13-18,ESPOSITO>I'll send a team over there first thing.

236
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,090
<13-18,ESPOSITO>让他们去和那里的商贩谈谈
<13-18,ESPOSITO>Have 'em talk to vendors,

237
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,970
<13-18,ESPOSITO>看是否有人记得见过她
<13-18,ESPOSITO>see if anybody remembers seeing her.

238
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,850
<13-19,CASTLE>或泰森
<13-19,CASTLE>Or Tyson.

239
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,810
<13-19,CASTLE>他在杀人前总是先跟踪她们
<13-19,CASTLE>He stalked his victims before he killed them.

240
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,240
<14-1,CASTLE>感觉就好像我为了今天的到来
<14-1,CASTLE>It's like I've been holding my breath for a year,

241
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,790
<14-1,CASTLE>屏息以待了整整一年
<14-1,CASTLE>waiting for this day to come.

242
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,840
<14-1,CASTLE>整整一年我苦思冥想
<14-1,CASTLE>A whole year of wondering about him,

243
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,970
<14-1,CASTLE>切齿痛恨
<14-1,CASTLE>hating him,

244
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,600
<14-1,CASTLE>魂牵梦萦
<14-1,CASTLE>dreaming about him,

245
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,800
<14-1,CASTLE>试着以他的角度思考
<14-1,CASTLE>trying to think like him...

246
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,040
<14-1,CASTLE>但还是不知道如何能将他缉拿归案
<14-1,CASTLE>but still having no clue how to catch him.

247
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,970
<14-2,MARTHA>缉拿连环杀手不是你的工作
<14-2,MARTHA>It's not your job to catch a serial killer.

248
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,870
<14-3,CASTLE>因为我不是警察
<14-3,CASTLE>Because I'm not a cop.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
<14-4,CASTLE>我总喜欢假装自己是贝克特的拍档
<14-4,CASTLE>I like to pretend I'm Beckett's partner

250
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,080
<14-4,CASTLE>就像我是警察一样
<14-4,CASTLE>and like I'm one of them,

251
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,110
<14-4,CASTLE>但到像今天这样的时候  我才意识到...
<14-4,CASTLE>But days like today, I realize, I...

252
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,960
<14-4,CASTLE>我只不过是在优孟衣冠罢了
<14-4,CASTLE>that I've just been playacting.

253
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,650
<14-5,MARTHA>我记得你这"优孟衣冠"可曾拯救过纽约市呢
<14-5,MARTHA>Your playacting once helped saved New York city as I recall.

254
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,700
<14-6,MARTHA>去支持你的朋友
<14-6,MARTHA>Be there for your friends.

255
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,150
<14-6,MARTHA>站在他们身边  一起努力
<14-6,MARTHA>Stand beside them, work together.

256
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,470
<14-6,MARTHA>那就是最大的帮助
<14-6,MARTHA>That's plenty useful.

257
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,880
<14-6,MARTHA>相信我
<14-6,MARTHA>Trust me.

258
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,350
<15-1,ROOM MATE>很抱歉  我不认识他
<15-1,ROOM MATE>I'm sorry. I don't know him.

259
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,190
<15-1,ROOM MATE>简和我只做了六个月室友而已
<15-1,ROOM MATE>Jane and I were only roommates for six months.

260
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,840
<15-2,ROOM MATE>也许他就是她的男朋友
<15-2,ROOM MATE>Maybe he was the guy she was seeing.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,880
<15-3,RYAN>简有男朋友吗
<15-3,RYAN>Jane had a boyfriend?

262
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,410
<15-4,ROOM MATE>她不愿意跟我说他的事
<15-4,ROOM MATE>She wouldn't tell me about him,

263
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,010
<15-4,ROOM MATE>也不让他来我们这
<15-4,ROOM MATE>and... she wouldn't let him come around.

264
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,440
<15-5,RYAN>为什么简不愿意谈及他
<15-5,RYAN>Why wouldn't Jane talk about him?

265
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,870
<15-6,ROOM MATE>她说在关系公开以前
<15-6,ROOM MATE>She said that he had some things he needed to figure out

266
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,940
<15-6,ROOM MATE>他还有一些事情要处理
<15-6,ROOM MATE>before they could go public.

267
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,650
<15-6,ROOM MATE>老实说  我想他大概是已婚人士吧
<15-6,ROOM MATE>Honestly, I just thought, maybe he was married.

268
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,810
<15-6,ROOM MATE>然后  大约在六周之前
<15-6,ROOM MATE>Then, like, six weeks ago...

269
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,010
<15-6,ROOM MATE>事情出现了变化
<15-6,ROOM MATE>things changed.

270
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,340
<15-7,BECKETT>怎么变化了
<15-7,BECKETT>Changed how?

271
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,250
<15-8,ROOM MATE>她变得总是哭哭啼啼
<15-8,ROOM MATE>She was crying all the time

272
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,420
<15-8,ROOM MATE>还常常在深夜接到电话
<15-8,ROOM MATE>and she would get phone calls really late at night

273
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,810
<15-8,ROOM MATE>接了电话后会十分难过
<15-8,ROOM MATE>and be really upset afterwards.

274
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,590
<15-9,RYAN>你记得任何简接到电话的
<15-9,RYAN>Do you remember a specific time or day

275
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,180
<15-9,RYAN>确切时间或日期吗
<15-9,RYAN>when Jane got one of these calls?

276
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,980
<15-10,ROOM MATE>上周四
<15-10,ROOM MATE>Last Thursday.

277
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,910
<15-10,ROOM MATE>大约十一点
<15-10,ROOM MATE>A-around 11:00.

278
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,160
<16-1,ESPOSITO>周四晚间十一点  简的手机接到一通来电
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Thursday night at 11:04, Jane got a call on her cell.

279
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,290
<16-1,ESPOSITO>我们的人说那通电话是从城里山姆酒吧的
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Our guys say that call originated on a pay phone

280
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,580
<16-1,ESPOSITO>公用电话打来的
<16-1,ESPOSITO>in Sammy's Bar in midtown.

281
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,620
<16-2,BECKETT>过去六周里这个号码每周两通电话
<16-2,BECKETT>Two calls a week to the same number over the last six weeks?

282
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,400
<16-3,RYAN>是他
<16-3,RYAN>It's him.

283
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,580
<16-3,RYAN>我见过她几次
<16-3,RYAN>I've seen her, couple of times.

284
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,370
<17-1,BARTENDER>是和赛斯一起来的
<17-1,BARTENDER>Yeah, came in with Seth.

285
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,100
<17-2,RYAN>这是赛斯吗
<17-2,RYAN>Is this Seth?

286
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,120
<17-3,BARTENDER>不  那不是他
<17-3,BARTENDER>Nah. That ain't him.

287
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,110
<17-4,RYAN>你确定  看仔细了
<17-4,RYAN>You sure? Take a good look this time.

288
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,870
<17-5,BARTENDER>赛斯是个熟客
<17-5,BARTENDER>Seth's a regular.

289
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,910
<17-3,BARTENDER>那不是他
<17-3,BARTENDER>That ain't him.

290
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,770
<17-5,BARTENDER>但你们如果想跟赛斯谈谈  留下
<17-5,BARTENDER>But if you want to talk to Seth, just stick around.

291
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,550
<17-5,BARTENDER>他几乎每天都来这
<17-5,BARTENDER>He usually comes in here pretty much every day.

292
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,500
<17-6,BECKETT>干什么
<17-6,BECKETT>Doing what?

293
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
<17-7,BARTENDER>他常常使用那边那台电话
<17-7,BARTENDER>He uses that phone over there a lot.

294
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,420
<17-7,BARTENDER>和一些獐头鼠目的人们见面
<17-7,BARTENDER>Meets with shifty looking individuals

295
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,020
<17-7,BARTENDER>他说  是一起工作的人
<17-7,BARTENDER>he calls, uh, associates.

296
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,810
<17-7,BARTENDER>有一次  他的夹克卷在背上
<17-7,BARTENDER>One time, his jacket rolled up in the back.

297
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,600
<17-7,BARTENDER>他带着枪
<17-7,BARTENDER>He was strapped.

298
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,150
<17-8,BECKETT>听起来是个毒贩
<17-8,BECKETT>Sounds like a drug dealer.

299
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,290
<17-9,BECKETT>赛斯一般什么时候过来
<17-9,BECKETT>All right, so what time does Seth usually come in?

300
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,060
<17-10,BARTENDER>大概三点
<17-10,BARTENDER>About three.

301
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,340
<17-10,BARTENDER>你们可以在这等着
<17-10,BARTENDER>Stay if you want,

302
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,510
<17-10,BARTENDER>但我还有事情要做
<17-10,BARTENDER>but I gotta get back to work.

303
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,120
<18-1,CASTLE>莱恩还好吗
<18-1,CASTLE>So how's Ryan holding up?

304
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,880
<18-2,ESPOSITO>我最后一次伊拉克服役归来  三天后
<18-2,ESPOSITO>Three days after my last tour in Iraq,

305
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,350
<18-2,ESPOSITO>我跟朋友们在吃饭
<18-2,ESPOSITO>I'm at a diner with friends.

306
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,290
<18-2,ESPOSITO>一辆车回火
<18-2,ESPOSITO>A car backfires.

307
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,410
<18-2,ESPOSITO>朋友回头一看  我已经躲在桌底下了
<18-2,ESPOSITO>My friends look around. I'm under the table.

308
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,460
<18-3,ESPOSITO>莱恩是在等下一起案件
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Ryan's just waiting for the next hit.

309
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,830
<18-3,ESPOSITO>我不明白的是
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Here's what I don't get--

310
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,710
<19-1,RYAN>我的枪怎么跑到毒贩手里的
<19-1,RYAN>what's a drug dealer doing with my gun?

311
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,880
<19-2,BECKETT>也许泰森把枪卖了  或扔了
<19-2,BECKETT>Well, maybe Tyson sold it to him or tossed it,

312
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,160
<19-2,BECKETT>落到了赛斯手上
<19-2,BECKETT>and Seth found it.

313
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,240
<19-3,RYAN>这不像杰瑞·泰森的做法
<19-3,RYAN>That doesn't sound like Jerry Tyson.

314
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,920
<19-3,RYAN>3XK做事很有计划
<19-3,RYAN>3XK always has a plan.

315
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,860
<19-3,RYAN>也许赛斯是个替死鬼
<19-3,RYAN>So maybe Seth is a patsy.

316
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,130
<19-4,SETH>今天怎么样  小乔
<19-4,SETH>How you feeling, JoJo?

317
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,180
<19-5,BARTENDER>赛斯  你怎么样
<19-5,BARTENDER>Hey, Seth, how's going?

318
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,350
<19-6,BECKETT>你可以等下亲自问问了
<19-6,BECKETT>Looks like you'll be able to ask him yourself.

319
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,910
<19-7,BECKETT>赛斯  我是贝克特探长  纽约警局
<19-7,BECKETT>Hey, Seth. Detective Beckett, NYPD.

320
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,370

<20-1,RYAN>Back alley. He's on the move! On the move!

<20-4,RYAN>Get up against the car, right now!

324
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,280
<20-4,RYAN>有枪
<20-4,RYAN>Gun.

325
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,880
<20-5,RYAN>是格洛克17型
<20-5,RYAN>It's a Glock 17.

326
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,090
<20-6,ESPOSITO>你有持枪许可吗
<20-6,ESPOSITO>You got a permit for this?

327
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
<20-7,SETH>当然  蠢货  我是警察
<20-7,SETH>Sure do, ponch. I'm a cop.

328
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,590
<20-7,SETH>赛斯·卡沃警探  缉毒组的
<20-7,SETH>Detective Seth Carver. Narcotics.

329
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,070
<20-7,SETH>帮个忙  在我的身份彻底曝光前
<20-7,SETH>Do me a favor and put me in the vehicle

330
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,870
<20-7,SETH>把我押上车  成不
<20-7,SETH>before you blow my cover completely, will you?

331
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,980
<21-1,SETH>让我猜猜
<21-1,SETH>So let me guess.

332
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,480
<21-1,SETH>你们找过她的妈妈和朋友
<21-1,SETH>You talked to her Mom and her girlfriends,

333
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,280
<21-1,SETH>都说简是个天使般的乖乖女  对吗
<21-1,SETH>and all of 'em said that Jane was an angel. Am I right?

334
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,450
<21-2,ESPOSITO>你的意思是  她不是
<21-2,ESPOSITO>So you're saying, she wasn't?

335
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,270
<21-3,SETH>我遇见她时
<21-3,SETH>I'm saying that when I met her,

336
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,130
<21-3,SETH>是因为她闯红灯  将她拦下
<21-3,SETH>I was pulling her over for blowin' a red light,

337
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,760
<21-3,SETH>在车里的储物箱内发现了毒品
<21-3,SETH>and she had 2 grams in the glove compartment.

338
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,960
<21-4,RYAN>简不吸毒
<21-4,RYAN>Jane didn't do drugs.

339
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,990
<21-5,SETH>我能说啥
<21-5,SETH>What can I tell ya?

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,190
<21-5,SETH>小姑娘车上有毒品
<21-5,SETH>Little miss was riding dirty.

341
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,840
<21-6,RYAN>但你没有起诉她
<21-6,RYAN>You--you didn't charge her.

342
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,300
<21-6,RYAN>系统里没有记录
<21-6,RYAN>There's--there's nothing in the system.

343
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,260
<21-6,RYAN>是的
<21-6,RYAN>Right.

344
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,480
<21-7,SETH>因为当我问她可卡因是哪里来的
<21-7,SETH>That's because when I asked her where the coke came from,

345
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,400
<21-7,SETH>她说是本·李给她的
<21-7,SETH>she told me Ben Lee gave it to her.

346
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,920
<21-8,RYAN>-本·李是谁  -本是谁...
<21-8,RYAN>- Who's Ben Lee? - Who's Ben...

347
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,910
<21-9,SETH>克利福德·李的儿子
<21-9,SETH>Son of Clifford Lee.

348
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,000
<21-10,SETH>他是汉义堂的老大
<21-10,SETH>He's the head of the Han Yi Tong.

349
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,630
<21-10,SETH>以莫特街上那家中式小吃店做门面
<21-10,SETH>Operates out of a dim sum house on Mott Street.

350
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,170
<22-1,CASTLE>汉义堂是什么
<22-1,CASTLE>What's the Han Yi Tong?

351
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,530
<22-2,BECKETT>堂是一种中式商业组织
<22-2,BECKETT>Tongs are a Chinese merchant organization.

352
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,830
<22-2,BECKETT>多数是合法的
<22-2,BECKETT>Most of them are legit,

353
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,860
<22-2,BECKETT>但有些是掩护中国黑帮的门面
<22-2,BECKETT>but some of them are a front for the Chinese mob.

354
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,870
<22-3,CASTLE>那克利福德·李就像是教父了
<22-3,CASTLE>So Clifford Lee would be like the Godfather.

355
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,130
<22-4,BECKETT>是的
<22-4,BECKETT>Oh, yeah.

356
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,120
<23-1,RYAN>克利福德·李的儿子不过卖了她一点毒品
<23-1,RYAN>How's Jane supposed to help you get to Clifford Lee

357
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,090
<23-1,RYAN>就凭这点  简怎么帮你抓他
<23-1,RYAN>based on one coke buy off his kid?

358
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,560
<23-2,SETH>在教育问题上
<23-2,SETH>When it comes to education,

359
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,390
<23-2,SETH>克利福德·李持传统的中国思想
<23-2,SETH>Clifford Lee is an old-school Chinese.

360
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,110
<23-2,SETH>他的儿子们虽说是毒贩
<23-2,SETH>His sons may be drug-dealing criminals,

361
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,050
<23-2,SETH>但也要大学毕业才行
<23-2,SETH>but they still need to graduate college.

362
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,420
<23-3,ESPOSITO>本·李是她的一个学生
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Ben Lee was one of her students.

363
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,200
<23-3,ESPOSITO>她是他的家教
<23-3,ESPOSITO>She was tutoring him.

364
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,130
<23-4,SETH>她一周会去他们家两次
<23-4,SETH>Twice a week, she was in their house.

365
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,480
<23-4,SETH>我说如果她能弄到李家犯罪的确凿证据
<23-4,SETH>I told her I would drop the possession charges,

366
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,730
<23-4,SETH>我就不会以持有毒品罪起诉她
<23-4,SETH>if she brought me some solid intel on Lee's criminal operations.

367
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,860
<23-4,SETH>她接受了
<23-4,SETH>She said okay.

368
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,900
<23-4,SETH>但她好像露出马脚  他们就把她杀了
<23-4,SETH>And somehow she tipped 'em off, and they killed her.

369
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,590
<23-5,RYAN>就这些
<23-5,RYAN>That's it?

370
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,550
<23-6,SETH>我已经给了你一条有用的线索
<23-6,SETH>I just handed you a solid lead.

371
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,670
<23-6,SETH>怎么还想要其他的吗
<23-6,SETH>What, he wants more? What is this?

372
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,750
<23-7,RYAN>你说真话怎么样
<23-7,RYAN>Yeah, how about the truth?

373
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,190
<24-1,BECKETT>莱恩  别冲动  稳住阵脚
<24-1,BECKETT>Come on, Ryan. Keep it together.

374
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,370
<24-1,BECKETT>你指望我们相信  困扰了你多年的案子
<24-1,BECKETT>You expect us to believe that you worked a case for years,

375
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,040
<24-1,BECKETT>然后在一个幸运的周六晚上
<24-1,BECKETT>and then one lucky Saturday night,

376
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,170
<25-1,RYAN>就这么碰巧逮到了个完美的线人
<25-1,RYAN>you just happen to roll up on the perfect C.I.?

377
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,740
<25-2,RYAN>我也在缉毒组待过  卡沃
<25-2,RYAN>See, I did my time in narcotics, Carver.

378
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,380
<25-2,RYAN>看得出谁在玩阴招
<25-2,RYAN>I know a shortcut when I hear one.

379
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,010
<25-2,RYAN>莱恩
<25-2,RYAN>Ah, gee, Ryan.

380
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,560
<25-3,SETH>幸好我知道你不会
<25-3,SETH>If I didn't know any better,

381
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,050
<25-3,SETH>要不真以为你是在说我有不当行为呢
<25-3,SETH>I would think you were accusing me of something untoward.

382
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,740
<25-4,RYAN>你主动找上简·赫茨菲尔德
<25-4,RYAN>You targeted Jane Herzfeld.

383
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,320
<25-4,RYAN>你在她的车里放了毒品
<25-4,RYAN>You planted those drugs in her car,

384
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,020
<25-4,RYAN>然后你强迫她帮你
<25-4,RYAN>and then you made her help you out.

385
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,590
<25-4,RYAN>你让她一人身入险境
<25-4,RYAN>You--you sent her in there alone--

386
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,830
<25-4,RYAN>没有后援  没人保护  现在她死了
<25-4,RYAN>no backup, no protection-- and now she's dead.

387
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
<25-5,SETH>又不是我杀的她
<25-5,SETH>Yeah, well, I didn't make her dead.

388
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,070
<25-6,RYAN>一通鬼话
<25-6,RYAN>The hell you didn't.

389
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,480
<25-6,RYAN>你也许没有扣扳机
<25-6,RYAN>You may have not pulled the trigger,

390
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,220
<25-6,RYAN>但你跟凶手一样  罪大恶极
<25-6,RYAN>but you're as guilty as the creep who did.

391
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,690
<25-6,RYAN>那你呢  老兄
<25-6,RYAN>What about you, man?

392
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,090
<25-7,SETH>看看你自己
<25-7,SETH>Look at yourself.

393
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,140
<25-7,SETH>传言都说  凶手用的可是你的枪
<25-7,SETH>Word around the house is that that creep used your gun.

394
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,210
<25-7,SETH>自己的枪都弄丢  这警察当的真窝囊
<25-7,SETH>What kind of cop can't keep hold of his own weapon?

395
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,080
<25-7,SETH>你刚才说什么
<25-7,SETH>What did you say to me?

396
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,220
<25-7,SETH>-我们走  -你给我再说一遍
<25-7,SETH>- Let's go. - Say it to me! Say it!

397
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,090
<27-1,RYAN>说啊  有种你再说一遍
<27-1,RYAN>Say it! I want you to say it! Say it to my--

398
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,940
<27-2,BECKETT>放手
<27-2,BECKETT>Hey, break it up.

399
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,740
<27-2,BECKETT>放手
<27-2,BECKETT>Break it up.

400
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,610
<27-3,BECKETT>我们都是警察
<27-3,BECKETT>We're all cops here. Okay?

401
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,130
<27-4,SETH>如果话问完了
<27-4,SETH>If you're all done,

402
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,720
<27-4,SETH>我就走了
<27-4,SETH>I think I'll take my leave now.

403
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,830
<27-5,BECKETT>走吧  谢谢你的帮助  卡沃
<27-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Thanks for your help, Carver.

404
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,700
<27-6,SETH>不客气
<27-6,SETH>You got it.

405
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,830
<27-7,BECKETT>你这是干什么
<27-7,BECKETT>What are you trying to do?

406
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,670
<27-7,BECKETT>想把警监也招过来吗
<27-7,BECKETT>You want the captain to come in here?

407
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,210
<27-8,BECKETT>冷静一下
<27-8,BECKETT>Go cool off.

408
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,810
<28-1,BECKETT>他就是个混蛋
<28-1,BECKETT>Guy's a jerk.

409
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,680
<28-2,RYAN>我刚到缉毒组时
<28-2,RYAN>When I started in narcotics,

410
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,030
<28-2,RYAN>真是一无所知
<28-2,RYAN>I was so green.

411
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,110
<28-2,RYAN>一点都不懂规矩
<28-2,RYAN>I-I didn't know how things got done.

412
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,150
<28-3,RYAN>一天  我们有大规模缉毒行动
<28-3,RYAN>One day, there's this major bust--

413
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,950
<28-3,RYAN>抓捕一伙制造冰毒的街党
<28-3,RYAN>a street gang cooking meth.

414
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,590
<28-3,RYAN>他们把人集中在大堂
<28-3,RYAN>They're stacking up guys in the bullpen,

415
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,050
<28-3,RYAN>一个一个的做笔录
<28-3,RYAN>taking their statements one by one.

416
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,140
<28-3,RYAN>乱成一团
<28-3,RYAN>Place is a zoo.

417
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,080
<28-3,RYAN>我是负责接电话的
<28-3,RYAN>I'm answering phones in the squad.

418
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,550
<28-3,RYAN>一个女孩打来
<28-3,RYAN>Girl on the line,

419
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,040
<28-3,RYAN>叫艾丽莎  找我们警督
<28-3,RYAN>name of Alisha, asking for my Lieutenant.

420
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,900
<28-3,RYAN>我就朝着大堂另一面喊
<28-3,RYAN>So I call out across the bullpen,

421
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,780
<28-3,RYAN>卢  你的电话  艾丽莎找
<28-3,RYAN>"Hey, Lou, Alisha's on the phone for you."

422
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,170
<28-4,RYAN>正是她的消息  让我们抓到了人
<28-4,RYAN>It was her tip that got these guys nailed,

423
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,040
<28-4,RYAN>而所有人都听着我喊出她的名字
<28-4,RYAN>and all of 'em just heard me call out her name.

424
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,610
<28-5,RYAN>我们整日整夜地找她
<28-5,RYAN>Searched all day and all night,

425
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,170
<28-5,RYAN>希望赶在她是缉毒警察的消息
<28-5,RYAN>looking for her, before the gang could

426
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,600
<28-5,RYAN>传出去前  能把她找到
<28-5,RYAN>get word back to the street that she was a narc.

427
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,980
<28-6,BECKETT>那你们找到她了吗
<28-6,BECKETT>Did you find her?

428
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,790
<28-6,BECKETT>找到了
<28-6,BECKETT>I did.

429
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,420
<28-7,RYAN>让她加入证人保护计划  但...
<28-7,RYAN>Got her into witness protection, but...

430
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,720
<28-7,RYAN>那是我做警察干的最蠢的一件事
<28-7,RYAN>That was the stupidest thing I'd ever done as a cop...

431
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,830
<28-9,RYAN>直到那天  杰瑞·泰森先发制人
<28-9,RYAN>Until the day Jerry Tyson got the drop on me

432
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,750
<28-9,RYAN>偷了我的枪
<28-9,RYAN>and stole my weapon.

433
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,040
<28-10,RYAN>卡沃是个混蛋
<28-10,RYAN>Carver is a jerk...

434
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,570
<28-10,RYAN>但他说的对
<28-10,RYAN>But he's got a point.

435
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,880
<28-10,RYAN>来吧
<28-10,RYAN>Come on.

436
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,360
<29-1,BECKETT>你知道卡沃哪一点可能说的对吗
<29-1,BECKETT>You know what Carver could have a point about?

437
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,110
<29-1,BECKETT>是本·李
<29-1,BECKETT>Is Ben Lee.

438
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,630
<29-1,BECKETT>如果本真向简走漏了消息
<29-1,BECKETT>If Ben did tip to Jane,

439
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,090
<29-1,BECKETT>那他便有很强的杀人动机
<29-1,BECKETT>then that's a strong motive.

440
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,940
<29-1,BECKETT>你想去唐人街转转吗
<29-1,BECKETT>You up for a trip to Chinatown?

441
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,120
<29-2,RYAN>必须的
<29-2,RYAN>Hell, yeah.

442
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,250
<29-3,ESPOSITO>巡警在中央车站那里找到了线索
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Uniforms at Grand Central caught a break.

443
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,550
<29-3,ESPOSITO>他们找到了一个在街角邮箱中心上班的职员
<29-3,ESPOSITO>They found a clerk who works at a mailbox center around the corner,

444
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,010
<29-3,ESPOSITO>那人说简死亡当天曾向他租了一个邮箱
<29-3,ESPOSITO>who says he rented a box to Jane on the day she died.

445
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,620
<29-3,ESPOSITO>我要去查证一下  你一起来吗
<29-3,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna go check it out. You want to roll with me?

446
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,810
<29-4,RYAN>不了  我跟贝克特一起
<29-4,RYAN>No, I'm with Beckett.

447
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,070
<29-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你要去吗
<29-5,BECKETT>Castle, you want to come?

448
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,500
<29-6,CASTLE>我刚刚在想
<29-6,CASTLE>I-I was just thinking...

449
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,070
<29-6,CASTLE>如果凶手是李的手下
<29-6,CASTLE>if our killer is someone in Lee's organization,

450
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,160
<29-6,CASTLE>那他一定是从杰瑞·泰森那得到你的枪
<29-6,CASTLE>then he must have gotten your gun from Jerry Tyson.

451
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,680
<29-7,RYAN>也就是说凶手可能知道泰森的下落
<29-7,RYAN>Which means our killer may know Tyson's whereabouts.

452
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,790
<29-7,RYAN>我们抓到了他  就相当于抓到了3XK
<29-7,RYAN>We nail him, we nail 3XK.

453
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,770
<29-8,BECKETT>没错  但泰森的背景跟
<29-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but there's nothing in Tyson's background

454
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,510
<29-8,BECKETT>这个中国黑帮一点关联都没有
<29-8,BECKETT>that indicates a connection to the Chinese Mob.

455
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,910
<29-9,CASTLE>也许凶手跟李家有关系
<29-9,CASTLE>Maybe the shooter is connected to the Lees--

456
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,380
<29-9,CASTLE>在泰森的四年牢狱之灾中
<29-9,CASTLE>someone Tyson's crossed paths with

457
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,430
<29-9,CASTLE>跟凶手有过交集
<29-9,CASTLE>during his four years in prison,

458
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,050
<29-9,CASTLE>而那人正是为堂做事
<29-9,CASTLE>someone working for the Tong.

459
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,970
<29-9,CASTLE>如果我能找到那个人  也许就能找到凶手
<29-9,CASTLE>If I find out who that someone is, maybe we have our shooter.

460
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,010
<29-10,BECKETT>要查阅四年的监狱记录
<29-10,BECKETT>Wading through four years of prison records--

461
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,400
<29-10,BECKETT>还真是个大工程
<29-10,BECKETT>it's a lot of work.

462
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,380
<29-11,CASTLE>我不介意
<29-11,CASTLE>I don't mind.

463
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,950
<29-11,CASTLE>那好  我们走
<29-11,CASTLE>All right. Let's go.

464
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,780
<30-1,CLIFFORD LEE>警探们
<30-1,CLIFFORD LEE>Detectives.

465
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,950
<30-1,CLIFFORD LEE>我猜你们是为简的事而来
<30-1,CLIFFORD LEE>I assume you're here about Jane.

466
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,690
<30-2,CLIFFORD LEE>请坐
<30-2,CLIFFORD LEE>Please, sit.

467
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,680
<30-3,BECKETT>我知道简曾经是你的员工
<30-3,BECKETT>I understand Jane was an employee of yours.

468
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,580
<30-3,BECKETT>对吗
<30-3,BECKETT>Is that correct?

469
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,310
<30-4,CLIFFORD LEE>她曾是我儿子本的家教  这就是本
<30-4,CLIFFORD LEE>She tutored my son Ben. Oh, this is Ben,

470
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,480
<30-4,CLIFFORD LEE>我其他几个儿子菲利普  大卫  史蒂文
<30-4,CLIFFORD LEE>my other sons, Philip, David, Steven.

471
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,470
<30-5,RYAN>本  你最后一次见简是什么时候
<30-5,RYAN>When was the last time you saw Jane, Ben?

472
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,440
<30-6,BEN LEE>上周
<30-6,BEN LEE>Last week.

473
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,800
<30-6,BEN LEE>前天我们本来约好了
<30-6,BEN LEE>We had an appointment the day before yesterday,

474
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,610
<30-6,BEN LEE>但她取消了
<30-6,BEN LEE>but she canceled.

475
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,070
<30-7,BECKETT>你们都在什么地方见面
<30-7,BECKETT>And where would you meet?

476
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,390
<30-8,BEN>有时在学校  有时在我家
<30-8,BEN>Sometimes at school. Sometimes at my house.

477
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,900
<30-9,RYAN>简是个好老师吗  你喜欢她吗  本
<30-9,RYAN>Was Jane a good tutor? Did you like her, Ben?

478
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,640
<30-10,BEN>她还不错
<30-10,BEN>She was okay.

479
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,170
<30-11,PHILLIP LEE>问这些是什么意思
<30-11,PHILLIP LEE>What's with all these questions?

480
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,460
<30-11,PHILLIP LEE>他刚刚才说没见过她
<30-11,PHILLIP LEE>He just said he hadn't seen her.

481
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,420
<30-11,PHILLIP LEE>菲利普
<30-11,PHILLIP LEE>Philip.

482
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,060
<30-13,BECKETT>李先生  事实上
<30-13,BECKETT>The truth is, Mr. Lee,

483
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,540
<30-13,BECKETT>我们发现了一些有关简的信息
<30-13,BECKETT>we've uncovered some information about Jane

484
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,440
<30-13,BECKETT>而干你这行的人可能会为之困扰
<30-13,BECKETT>that a man in your line of work might find troubling.

485
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,890
<30-14,CLIFFORD LEE>你是说她生前做过线人
<30-14,CLIFFORD LEE>You mean that she was an informant?

486
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,490
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>简在大约一个月前跟我交代过
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>Jane told me herself, about a month ago.

487
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,340
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>她说有一个坏警察
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>She said that a bad cop

488
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,560
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>陷害了她
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>had framed her

489
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>还强迫她协助他
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>and is forcing her to help him.

490
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,140
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>我告诉她关于我们她也确实没什么可说的
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>I told her that there was nothing to tell this man about us

491
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,240
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>因为我们都是正经商人
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>because we are honest businessmen.

492
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,340
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>我希望那位警官等得厌烦了
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>I hoped the officer would grow tired of waiting

493
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,290
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>就会放过她
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>and leave her alone,

494
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,160
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>但很不幸  事与愿违
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>but unfortunately, that did not happen.

495
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,200
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>恐怕你们要找的真凶
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>I'm afraid your killer

496
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,040
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>或许远在天边近在眼前
<30-15,CLIFFORD LEE>may be closer to home than you think.

497
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,320
<30-16,BECKETT>卡沃探员已经洗清嫌疑了
<30-16,BECKETT>We've already ruled out Detective Carver.

498
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,510
<30-17,CLIFFORD LEE>当然
<30-17,CLIFFORD LEE>Of course.

499
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,910
<30-18,RYAN>那你们这些
<30-18,RYAN>And what were you...

500
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,270
<30-18,RYAN>正经商人在简遇害当晚十点至午夜间
<30-18,RYAN>honest businessmen doing between 10:00 p.m. and midnight

501
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,280
<30-18,RYAN>都在做什么呢
<30-18,RYAN>on the night Jane was killed?

502
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,930
<30-19,CLIFFORD LEE>当时我们在家里看电视
<30-19,CLIFFORD LEE>We were home, watching television.

503
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,840
<30-19,CLIFFORD LEE>如果你们想证实这个消息的话
<30-19,CLIFFORD LEE>Please feel free to speak to any of my household staff

504
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,590
<30-19,CLIFFORD LEE>可以随便盘问我家的佣人
<30-19,CLIFFORD LEE>if you wish to verify this information.

505
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:12,790
<30-20,RYAN>我们一定会的
<30-20,RYAN>We will.

506
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,930
<31-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸爸  那些都是什么东西
<31-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Hey, dad. What's all that?

507
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,040
<31-2,CASTLE>囚犯记录
<31-2,CASTLE>Convict reports.

508
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,590
<31-2,CASTLE>我要查出杰瑞·泰森
<31-2,CASTLE>I'm trying to figure out whom the bad guy

509
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,810
<31-2,CASTLE>把莱恩的枪给哪个大坏蛋了
<31-2,CASTLE>Jerry Tyson gave Ryan's gun to.

510
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,670
<31-3,MARTHA>查到了吗
<31-3,MARTHA>Any luck?

511
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,360
<31-4,CASTLE>相当于大海捞针
<31-4,CASTLE>I'm looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack.

512
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,090
<31-5,MARTHA>那箱子里一定有跟泰森有关的东西
<31-5,MARTHA>Somewhere in that box is a link to Tyson.

513
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,810
<31-6,CASTLE>只是我还没有找到
<31-6,CASTLE>I'm just not seeing it.

514
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,350
<31-7,ALEXIS>我虽然想帮你
<31-7,ALEXIS>Well, I'd offer to help,

515
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,400
<31-7,ALEXIS>但还有一大堆投诉信等着我看呢
<31-7,ALEXIS>but I've got all these complaint letters to read.

516
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,530
<31-8,CASTLE>怎么  你这是辍学了
<31-8,CASTLE>What, did you drop out of school

517
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,700
<31-8,CASTLE>-在消协找了个活儿吗  -才不是呢
<31-8,CASTLE>- and get a job in consumer relations? - No.

518
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,560
<31-9,ALEXIS>毕业班选我做了
<31-9,ALEXIS>The senior class made me

519
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,440
<31-9,ALEXIS>向行政机构提出倡导的执行联络人
<31-9,ALEXIS>their executive liaison advocate to the administration.

520
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,870
<31-10,CASTLE>听起来是一项殊荣啊
<31-10,CASTLE>Well, that sounds like quite an honor.

521
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,980
<31-11,ALEXIS>不算是
<31-11,ALEXIS>Not really.

522
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,040
<31-12,MARTHA>常春藤大学更喜欢
<31-12,MARTHA>Ivy League schools look fondly on applicants

523
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,830
<31-12,MARTHA>当过学生会干部的申请人
<31-12,MARTHA>who serve in student government,

524
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,530
<31-12,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯是在再次申请斯坦福之前
<31-12,MARTHA>and Alexis is beefing up her resume

525
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,970
<31-12,MARTHA>丰富她的简历
<31-12,MARTHA>before she reapplies to Stanford.

526
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,580
<31-13,ALEXIS>哪里都一样  如果我还打算上大学的话
<31-13,ALEXIS>Or anywhere, if I even go to college at all.

527
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,780
<31-14,ALEXIS>切尔西已经做了三年的倡导人
<31-14,ALEXIS>Chelsea's been our advocate for the last three years,

528
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,920
<31-14,ALEXIS>当我跟她说我想多尽点力的时候
<31-14,ALEXIS>and when I told her I wanted to be more involved,

529
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,490
<31-14,ALEXIS>她就主动卸任
<31-14,ALEXIS>she offered to step aside

530
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,420
<31-14,ALEXIS>让我接管了这个工作
<31-14,ALEXIS>and let me take over the position.

531
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,400
<31-15,CASTLE>那她人不错啊
<31-15,CASTLE>Well, that was nice of her.

532
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,290
<31-16,MARTHA>不算是
<31-16,MARTHA>Not really.

533
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,440
<31-17,CASTLE>-又"不算是"  -是啊
<31-17,CASTLE>- Again with the not really. - Yeah.

534
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,010
<31-18,ALEXIS>我刚接这活的时候也不知道
<31-18,ALEXIS>I didn't know when I agreed to do it,

535
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,760
<31-18,ALEXIS>你只能数个小时坐在那一动也不动
<31-18,ALEXIS>but you just sit there for hours and hours

536
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
<31-18,ALEXIS>听所有人抱怨投诉
<31-18,ALEXIS>and listen to everyone complain.

537
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,420
<31-18,ALEXIS>我想切尔西是厌倦了这份工作
<31-18,ALEXIS>I-I think Chelsea just got tired of it,

538
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,420
<31-18,ALEXIS>盘算着让我接管这烦人的差事
<31-18,ALEXIS>of figured she could stick me with the job.

539
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,990
<31-18,ALEXIS>我还把她当做朋友呢  但我想
<31-18,ALEXIS>And I thought she was my friend, but I guess--

540
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,790
<31-19,CASTLE>不算是
<31-19,CASTLE>Not really.

541
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,430
<31-20,MARTHA>认了吧  孩子
<31-20,MARTHA>Face it, kiddo.

542
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,690
<31-20,MARTHA>切尔西给你下了套
<31-20,MARTHA>Chelsea set you up.

543
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,090
<31-21,CASTLE>她给你下了套
<31-21,CASTLE>She set you up.

544
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,600
<31-21,CASTLE>你的朋友给你下了套
<31-21,CASTLE>Your friend set you up.

545
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,350
<32-1,RYAN>李家的所有佣人都众口一词
<32-1,RYAN>The Lees' entire household staff

546
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,880
<32-1,RYAN>证实了简·赫茨菲尔德被害当晚
<32-1,RYAN>confirms that the family was at home

547
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,460
<32-1,RYAN>全家人都在家看电视
<32-1,RYAN>watching television the night  was killed.

548
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,900
<32-2,BECKETT>是啊  意料之中的事
<32-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, there's no surprise there.

549
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,660
<32-2,BECKETT>中央车站那边有进展吗
<32-2,BECKETT>Hey, how'd it go at Grand Central?

550
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,830
<32-3,ESPOSITO>不错  我找到了这个
<32-3,ESPOSITO>Good. I found this.

551
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,260
<32-3,ESPOSITO>看标签  这是简·赫茨菲尔德的
<32-3,ESPOSITO>Check the tag. It belongs to Jane Herzfeld.

552
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,550
<32-4,RYAN>哪儿找到的
<32-4,RYAN>Where was it?

553
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,930
<32-5,ESPOSITO>就是在邮箱中心简租的那个箱子里
<32-5,ESPOSITO>At the mailbox center where Jane bought a box.

554
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,840
<32-5,ESPOSITO>她把那儿当成了储物柜存放这个包
<32-5,ESPOSITO>She was using it as a locker to hold this bag

555
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,710
<32-5,ESPOSITO>还有500块现金
<32-5,ESPOSITO>along with $500 in cash.

556
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,690
<32-6,RYAN>里面有男人的衣服
<32-6,RYAN>Hmm. There's men's clothes,

557
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,610
<32-6,RYAN>和一些化妆用品混放在一起
<32-6,RYAN>and toiletries mixed up in here.

558
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,550
<32-7,ESPOSITO>还有两张她死那天去凤凰城的
<32-7,ESPOSITO>And two tickets on the late train to Phoenix

559
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,740
<32-7,ESPOSITO>晚班火车票
<32-7,ESPOSITO>for the night she died.

560
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,120
<32-7,ESPOSITO>她想出城
<32-7,ESPOSITO>She was looking to get out of town,

561
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,480
<32-7,ESPOSITO>却不是独自离开
<32-7,ESPOSITO>but she wasn't going alone.

562
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,710
<32-8,RYAN>没有姓名  那要跟她一起走的人是谁呢
<32-8,RYAN>No names, so who was going with her?

563
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,140
<32-9,BECKETT>她的神秘男友
<32-9,BECKETT>Her mystery man.

564
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,260
<32-9,BECKETT>她室友说过她在跟某人恋爱
<32-9,BECKETT>Her roommate said that she was dating someone,

565
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,240
<32-9,BECKETT>一个还有事要处理的人
<32-9,BECKETT>someone who had some stuff to work out.

566
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,520
<32-10,RYAN>卡沃还一直烦着她  要她背叛李家
<32-10,RYAN>And Carver kept hassling her to betray the Lees.

567
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,690
<32-10,RYAN>也许他们觉得走为上策
<32-10,RYAN>Maybe they figured it was just smarter to get out of town.

568
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,040
<32-10,RYAN>但为什么是凤凰城呢
<32-10,RYAN>But why Phoenix?

569
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,100
<32-11,ESPOSITO>也许是因为那边干燥的气候  这是哮喘吸入器
<32-11,ESPOSITO>Maybe a drier climate. It's an asthma inhaler.

570
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,610
<32-11,ESPOSITO>但根据验尸报告
<32-11,ESPOSITO>But according to the autopsy report,

571
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,810
<32-11,ESPOSITO>简没有哮喘
<32-11,ESPOSITO>Jane didn't have asthma,

572
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,110
<32-11,ESPOSITO>所以这个一定是那个人的
<32-11,ESPOSITO>so it must have belonged to the guy.

573
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,480
<32-12,RYAN>没有贴处方  但有条形码
<32-12,RYAN>no prescription sticker, but there's a bar code.

574
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,920
<32-13,ESPOSITO>好  我会打电话给厂商
<32-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'm gonna call the manufacturer

575
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,590
<32-13,ESPOSITO>让他们查出出处
<32-13,ESPOSITO>and have 'em trace it.

576
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,230
<32-13,ESPOSITO>我想她的旅伴当时
<32-13,ESPOSITO>Oh, and in case her traveling companion

577
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,180
<32-13,ESPOSITO>可能在外面等她
<32-13,ESPOSITO>was waiting outside for her,

578
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,770
<32-13,ESPOSITO>我调出了在邮箱中心的隔壁的
<32-13,ESPOSITO>I pulled video from the bank security cameras

579
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,460
<32-13,ESPOSITO>银行监控录像
<32-13,ESPOSITO>next door to the mailbox center.

580
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,020
<33-1,BECKETT>好了  停  简出现了
<33-1,BECKETT>okay, stop. There's Jane.

581
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,180
<33-2,ESPOSITO>看看谁跟他在一起
<33-2,ESPOSITO>And who's that with her?

582
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,870
<33-3,RYAN>芬恩·麦奎恩  简的前男友
<33-3,RYAN>Finn McQueen, Jane's ex-boyfriend.

583
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,760
<33-3,RYAN>可他跟我们说已经几周没和简说话了
<33-3,RYAN>but he told us he hasn't talked to Jane in weeks.

584
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,300
<33-4,BECKETT>简和芬恩一起出城吗
<33-4,BECKETT>Jane was leaving town with Finn?

585
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
<33-5,ESPOSITO>不  那个旅行袋里的衣服  他穿不下
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Nah. He's too tall for the clothes in that bag.

586
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,630
<33-5,ESPOSITO>-不是他  -对
<33-5,ESPOSITO>- It's not him. - Yeah.

587
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,280
<33-7,RYAN>他像是在劝她别走
<33-7,RYAN>Looks like he's trying to talk her out of going.

588
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,130
<33-8,BECKETT>他夹克衫里装的是什么
<33-8,BECKETT>What's that in his jacket?

589
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,940
<33-9,RYAN>是把枪
<33-9,RYAN>That would be a weapon.

590
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,240
<33-10,BECKETT>像是把格洛克
<33-10,BECKETT>Looks like a glock.

591
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,040
<34-1,BECKETT>鉴证组在你的床垫下发现的
<34-1,BECKETT>C.S.U. found it under your mattress.

592
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,990
<34-1,BECKETT>芬恩  这把枪哪里来的
<34-1,BECKETT>Where'd you get the gun, Finn?

593
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,880
<34-2,BECKETT>我注意到这些序列号已经被锉掉了
<34-2,BECKETT>I notice the serial numbers have been filed off.

594
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,470
<34-2,BECKETT>而这把枪和杀死简的枪支
<34-2,BECKETT>And that's the same type of weapon

595
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,950
<34-2,BECKETT>是同一型号
<34-2,BECKETT>that was used to kill Jane.

596
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,930
<34-3,FINN>那不是我的
<34-3,FINN>That is not mine.

597
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,730
<34-3,FINN>再说你们已确认过我的不在场证明了
<34-3,FINN>And your guy confirmed my alibi.

598
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,130
<34-4,BECKETT>不在场证明可以作假
<34-4,BECKETT>Alibis can be bought.

599
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,120
<34-4,BECKETT>而摄像机不会骗人
<34-4,BECKETT>Video... doesn't lie.

600
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,040
<34-5,BECKETT>你知道简要出城
<34-5,BECKETT>You knew that Jane was leaving town,

601
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,400
<34-5,BECKETT>你也知道她爱上别人了  不是吗
<34-5,BECKETT>and you knew she was in love with someone else, didn't you?

602
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,530
<35-1,BECKETT>-他死不承认  可...  -贝克特
<35-1,BECKETT>- He keeps saying he didn't do it, but that's... - Beckett.

603
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,400
<35-1,BECKETT>-他很内疚  -贝克特
<35-1,BECKETT>- a man with a guilty conscience. - Beckett.

604
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,140
<35-2,ESPOSITO>-拿到弹道报告了  -不匹配
<35-2,ESPOSITO>- We got word from ballistics. - No match.

605
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,370
<35-3,RYAN>那把枪是格洛克17型手枪  可不是我的
<35-3,RYAN>The gun's a Glock 17, but it's not mine.

606
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,440
<35-4,ESPOSITO>埃斯波西托警探  知道了
<35-4,ESPOSITO>Detective Esposito. Gotcha.

607
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,980
<35-5,CASTLE>我知道凶手是谁了
<35-5,CASTLE>I know who the killer is.

608
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,050
<35-6,ESPOSITO>谢谢你打回电话来
<35-6,ESPOSITO>Thanks for getting back to me.

609
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,870
<35-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们刚得到坏消息
<35-7,BECKETT>Castle, we just got some bad news,

610
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,390
<35-7,BECKETT>所以求你别小说式推理
<35-7,BECKETT>So no hypotheticals.

611
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,350
<35-7,BECKETT>直接说名字
<35-7,BECKETT>Just give us a name.

612
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,180
<35-8,CASTLE>-人家得从头说嘛  -名字
<35-8,CASTLE>- Well, I have to start at the beginning - Name.

613
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,950
<35-10,CASTLE>李常金海
<35-10,CASTLE>Jinhai Li Chang.

614
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,610
<35-11,BECKETT>好  从头说起
<35-11,BECKETT>Okay, start from the beginning.

615
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,560
<35-12,CASTLE>谢谢  我昨晚意识到
<35-12,CASTLE>Thank you. So I realized last night,

616
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,910
<35-12,CASTLE>3XK绝不会把警察的枪给朋友
<35-12,CASTLE>3XK would never give a cop's gun to a friend.

617
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,610
<35-12,CASTLE>烫手的山芋  谁接谁倒霉
<35-12,CASTLE>A-a gun that hot would be a curse, not a blessing.

618
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,810
<35-12,CASTLE>可他会把这把枪给敌人
<35-12,CASTLE>But he would give it to an enemy.

619
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,530
<35-14,CASTLE>-所以呢  -所以我查了所有杰瑞·泰森
<35-14,CASTLE>- So? - So I went over all the incident reports

620
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,210
<35-14,CASTLE>在新新监狱服刑四年间的事故报告
<35-14,CASTLE>involving Jerry Tyson during his four years at Sing Sing,

621
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,920
<35-14,CASTLE>有一份报告相当起眼
<35-14,CASTLE>and one report in particular stood out.

622
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,900
<35-14,CASTLE>泰森在器械外场跟一个人起了冲突
<35-14,CASTLE>Tyson got into it with a guy in the weight yard,

623
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,760
<35-14,CASTLE>结果他被打断了下巴  进了医院
<35-14,CASTLE>and he ended up in the infirmary with a broken jaw.

624
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,350
<35-14,CASTLE>打伤他的人名叫李常金海
<35-14,CASTLE>The jawbreaker's name-- Jinhai Li Chang.

625
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,980
<35-14,CASTLE>眼熟吗
<35-14,CASTLE>Look familiar?

626
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,330
<35-15,RYAN>那是菲利普  克利福德·李的长子
<35-15,RYAN>That's Philip, Clifford Lee's oldest son.

627
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,100
<35-16,CASTLE>显然他们家搬到美国的时候
<35-16,CASTLE>Apparently Papa Clifford anglicized the family's names

628
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,550
<35-16,CASTLE>老爸给家里人都取了英文名
<35-16,CASTLE>when they moved into the country,

629
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,240
<35-16,CASTLE>却从没正式登记注册过
<35-16,CASTLE>but he never bothered to make them legal.

630
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,690
<35-16,CASTLE>这也是我花了这么长时间才找到的原因
<35-16,CASTLE>That's why it took me so long to find it.

631
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,570
<35-16,CASTLE>菲利普在2008年被控持械
<35-16,CASTLE>When Philip got his weapons charge in 2008,

632
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,580
<35-16,CASTLE>收押时他是用中文名登记的
<35-16,CASTLE>he was booked under his Chinese name.

633
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,970
<35-17,RYAN>可如果菲利普和泰森是死敌的话
<35-17,RYAN>But if Philip and Tyson were sworn enemies,

634
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,930
<35-17,RYAN>菲利普怎么会收那把枪呢
<35-17,RYAN>why would Philip accept the gun?

635
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,780
<35-18,CASTLE>他们俩最终和好了
<35-18,CASTLE>The two eventually became friends.

636
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,540
<35-19,BECKETT>不稀奇
<35-19,BECKETT>It happens.

637
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,280
<35-20,CASTLE>不可能和杰瑞·泰森和好
<35-20,CASTLE>Not with Jerry Tyson.

638
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,480
<35-20,CASTLE>那家伙没朋友  他是个变态
<35-20,CASTLE>That guy doesn't have any friends. He's a psychopath.

639
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,600
<35-20,CASTLE>变态报仇  十年不晚
<35-20,CASTLE>He wanted payback, and he was willing to wait.

640
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,180
<35-21,RYAN>泰森把我的枪卖给了菲利普
<35-21,RYAN>Tyson sold Philip my gun hoping he'd use it

641
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,140
<35-21,RYAN>希望他有朝一日会用
<35-21,RYAN>in the future.

642
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,170
<35-22,BECKETT>然后当菲利普发现简是个线人的时候
<35-22,BECKETT>And then when Philip found out that Jane was an informant,

643
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,340
<35-22,BECKETT>他就下手了
<35-22,BECKETT>he did just that.

644
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,390
<35-22,BECKETT>实际上  菲利普的动机
<35-22,BECKETT>Actually, Philip's motive

645
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,170
<35-23,ESPOSITO>可能还掺杂了很多私人恩怨
<35-23,ESPOSITO>may have been a little more personal than that.

646
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,530
<35-23,ESPOSITO>我们在简的旅行袋里发现的那个吸入器的条形码
<35-23,ESPOSITO>The bar code on the inhaler that we found in Jane's bag?

647
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,320
<35-23,ESPOSITO>那个吸入器是发给常翎麦的
<35-23,ESPOSITO>That inhaler was issued to one Ling Mai Chang,

648
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,980
<35-23,ESPOSITO>也就是本·李
<35-23,ESPOSITO>better known as Ben Lee.

649
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,000
<35-24,BECKETT>简是要和本出城
<35-24,BECKETT>Jane was leaving town with Ben.

650
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,700
<35-25,CASTLE>这么说  这是一段师生恋
<35-25,CASTLE>So student and tutor become boyfriend and girlfriend.

651
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,130
<35-25,CASTLE>他们相爱了  现代版"罗密欧与朱丽叶"
<35-25,CASTLE>They were in love. It's "Romeo And Juliet."

652
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,330
<35-26,BECKETT>简的确对改过自新的坏男孩情有独钟
<35-26,BECKETT>Well, Jane did have a thing for reforming bad boys.

653
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,290
<35-27,RYAN>对  可一旦加入亚洲黑帮  就是一辈子
<35-27,RYAN>Yeah, but Asian gangs-- you're in for life.

654
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,510
<35-27,RYAN>没有回头路可走
<35-27,RYAN>There's no walking away.

655
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,090
<35-28,ESPOSITO>所以就像罗密欧与朱丽叶
<35-28,ESPOSITO>So like Romeo and Juliet,

656
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,690
<35-28,ESPOSITO>终究还是有人丧生
<35-28,ESPOSITO>someone ended up dead.

657
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,620
<35-28,ESPOSITO>老哥菲利普发现
<35-28,ESPOSITO>Brother Philip found out about their plans

658
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,700
<35-28,ESPOSITO>他们准备私奔去凤凰城
<35-28,ESPOSITO>to go to Phoenix together,

659
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,200
<35-28,ESPOSITO>所以他杀了简  好留住他弟弟
<35-28,ESPOSITO>so he murdered Jane to keep little brother in the fold.

660
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,490
<35-29,BECKETT>这个理论很棒  伙计们
<35-29,BECKETT>Yeah, it's a great theory, guys.

661
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,970
<35-29,BECKETT>可我们缺样东西
<35-29,BECKETT>There's just one thing missing.

662
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,630
<35-29,BECKETT>证据  目击证人的描述
<35-29,BECKETT>Evidence, eyewitness accounts--

663
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,800
<35-29,BECKETT>得有确凿的证据才行
<35-29,BECKETT>Something to make this case stick.

664
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,870
<35-30,RYAN>我知道有个人能帮我们
<35-30,RYAN>I know someone that can help us out.

665
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,310
<36-1,FINN>你来放我出去吗
<36-1,FINN>You here to let me out?

666
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,010
<36-2,RYAN>芬恩  不是放你出去
<36-2,RYAN>Not to let you out, Finn.

667
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,610
<36-2,RYAN>是放你自由
<36-2,RYAN>To set you free.

668
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,190
<36-3,FINN>你们这帮警察
<36-3,FINN>You cops, man.

669
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,050
<36-3,FINN>你说放我自由  是什么意思
<36-3,FINN>What's that supposed to mean, set me free?

670
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,750
<36-3,FINN>芬恩  说出真相
<36-3,FINN>The truth, Finn.

671
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,770
<36-3,FINN>真相让你自由
<36-3,FINN>The truth sets you free.

672
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,720
<36-4,RYAN>我已经找了一整晚
<36-4,RYAN>I've been looking for it all night.

673
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,740
<36-4,RYAN>终于找到了
<36-4,RYAN>I finally found it.

674
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,860
<36-4,RYAN>谁能想到真相会藏在1996年的少年犯案底里
<36-4,RYAN>Who knew the truth would be hiding in a juvie report from 1996?

675
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,630
<36-4,RYAN>你给唐人街一个收注人转钱时被抓了
<36-4,RYAN>You got grabbed up moving paper for a Chinatown bookie.

676
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,860
<36-4,RYAN>还记得是谁保释你出来的吗
<36-4,RYAN>Do you remember who bailed you out?

677
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,940
<36-4,RYAN>克利福德·李
<36-4,RYAN>Clifford Lee.

678
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,380
<36-4,RYAN>你为李家效力多年
<36-4,RYAN>You been working for the Lees for years.

679
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,290
<36-4,RYAN>都是小差事  因为  芬恩  说白了
<36-4,RYAN>Little jobs, because, well, Finn, let's face it,

680
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,140
<36-4,RYAN>你就是一衰仔
<36-4,RYAN>You're kind of a screwup.

681
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,710
<36-4,RYAN>可你不满足于现状
<36-4,RYAN>But you wanted more.

682
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,810
<36-4,RYAN>所以当你发现本·李需要个家教的时候
<36-4,RYAN>So when you found out Ben Lee needed a tutor,

683
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,910
<36-4,RYAN>推荐了你的前女友...
<36-4,RYAN>you recommended your ex...

684
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,110
<36-4,RYAN>简
<36-4,RYAN>Jane...

685
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,820
<36-4,RYAN>以为这样能给你加点分
<36-4,RYAN>Thinking it would earn you points with the family.

686
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,760
<36-4,RYAN>然后你眼看着事情脱离了正轨
<36-4,RYAN>Then you watched it all go sideways

687
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,140
<36-4,RYAN>简和本相爱了
<36-4,RYAN>when Jane and Ben fell in love,

688
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,580
<36-4,RYAN>他们决定私奔
<36-4,RYAN>decided to leave town.

689
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,910
<36-4,RYAN>你想
<36-4,RYAN>You thought...

690
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,780
<36-4,RYAN>如果他们怪罪你怎么办
<36-4,RYAN>what if the family blamed you?

691
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,710
<36-4,RYAN>因为任何人都不能丢下家族事业
<36-4,RYAN>'Cause no one leaves the family business,

692
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,130
<36-4,RYAN>即使是为了爱也不行
<36-4,RYAN>not even for love.

693
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,190
<36-4,RYAN>所以你试图让她回心转意
<36-4,RYAN>So you tried to make her change her mind.

694
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,350
<36-4,RYAN>你们吵了一架
<36-4,RYAN>You fought.

695
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,300
<36-4,RYAN>可是她心意已决
<36-4,RYAN>But you couldn't change her mind.

696
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,960
<37-4,RYAN>所以你打电话给菲利普
<37-4,RYAN>So you made a call to Philip,

697
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,710
<36-4,RYAN>然后菲利普找上了简
<36-4,RYAN>and then Philip went and got Jane.

698
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,040
<36-5,RYAN>芬恩  还记得这个吗
<36-5,RYAN>Remember this, Finn?

699
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,700
<36-5,RYAN>我和她母亲谈过
<36-5,RYAN>I talked to her mother.

700
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,340
<36-5,RYAN>她说你在她21岁生日那天
<36-5,RYAN>She says you gave this cross to Jane

701
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,320
<36-5,RYAN>送了她这个十字架
<36-5,RYAN>on her 21st birthday.

702
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,060
<36-5,RYAN>她死的时候握着这个
<36-5,RYAN>She was holding it when she died...

703
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,200
<36-5,RYAN>为了寻求慰藉
<36-5,RYAN>for comfort.

704
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,530
<36-5,RYAN>因为她知道她快死了
<36-5,RYAN>Because she knew she was gonna die.

705
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,110
<36-6,RYAN>而且她非常...
<36-6,RYAN>And she was so...

706
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,490
<36-6,RYAN>害怕
<36-6,RYAN>afraid.

707
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,940
<37-1,ATTORNEY>让我先理清楚
<37-1,ATTORNEY>Let me make sure I got this straight.

708
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,320
<37-1,ATTORNEY>芬恩·麦奎恩声称他打电话给了我的当事人
<37-1,ATTORNEY>Finn McQueen claims that he phoned my client

709
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,550
<37-1,ATTORNEY>然后告诉他  他哥本
<37-1,ATTORNEY>and told him that his brother Ben

710
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,570
<37-1,ATTORNEY>要和简·赫茨菲尔德一起出城
<37-1,ATTORNEY>was leaving town with Jane Herzfeld,

711
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,270
<37-1,ATTORNEY>据称  我当事人的回答是
<37-1,ATTORNEY>to which my client allegedly replied,

712
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,010
<37-1,ATTORNEY>"我会处理的"
<37-1,ATTORNEY>"I'll take care of it."

713
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,810
<37-1,ATTORNEY>你们就只有这些证据吗
<37-1,ATTORNEY>Is that all you've got?

714
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,580
<37-2,ATTORNEY>我们已经证实菲利普
<37-2,ATTORNEY>We've already established that Philip

715
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,200
<37-2,ATTORNEY>在女孩被杀的当晚  正与家人待在家中
<37-2,ATTORNEY>was at home with his family when the girl was shot.

716
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,750
<37-3,BECKETT>那为何他的手机信号是从西十二街发出的
<37-3,BECKETT>Well, then why was his cell phone on West 12th Street?

717
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,240
<37-4,RYAN>你的当事人在当晚11点半
<37-4,RYAN>Your client made a phone call

718
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,330
<37-4,RYAN>打了一通电话到父母家
<37-4,RYAN>to his parents' house at 11:30 p.m.

719
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,290
<37-4,RYAN>那通电话通过西侧高速公路的一座信号塔转出
<37-4,RYAN>That call pinged off a tower off the West Side Highway,

720
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,380
<37-4,RYAN>离案发现场只有几个街区
<37-4,RYAN>which is a couple of blocks from our murder scene.

721
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,460
<37-4,RYAN>你是在打给你父亲
<37-4,RYAN>Were you calling your father,

722
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,610
<37-4,RYAN>告诉他任务完成了吗
<37-4,RYAN>letting him know the job was done?

723
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,340
<37-5,ATTORNEY>拜托  警探  就凭他的手机信号
<37-5,ATTORNEY>Please, detective. His phone pinged?

724
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,960
<37-5,ATTORNEY>你们知道这不足以起诉他谋杀
<37-5,ATTORNEY>You know that's not enough to charge him with murder.

725
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,440
<37-6,BECKETT>暂时还不行  不过给我点时间
<37-6,BECKETT>Not yet, but give me some time.

726
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,290
<37-6,BECKETT>如果你的当事人愿意谈谈条件
<37-6,BECKETT>Listen, if your client wants to talk deal--

727
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,470
<37-7,ATTORNEY>做梦吧
<37-7,ATTORNEY>Dream on.

728
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,710
<37-7,ATTORNEY>我们走  菲利普
<37-7,ATTORNEY>Let's go, Philip.

729
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
<37-8,RYAN>你用我的配枪杀了那个女孩
<37-8,RYAN>You killed that girl, and you used my weapon to do it,

730
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,730
<37-8,RYAN>让我现在备受煎熬
<37-8,RYAN>and now I carry that weight.

731
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,060
<37-8,RYAN>我告诉你  在你尝到同样的滋味之前
<37-8,RYAN>Trust me when I say to you that I will not rest

732
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,110
<37-8,RYAN>我绝不善罢甘休  相信我
<37-8,RYAN>until I make you carry it, too.

733
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,200
<37-9,ATTORNEY>盘问结束了
<37-9,ATTORNEY>We're done here.

734
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,560
<37-9,ATTORNEY>如果你们不事先告知我的事务所就试图
<37-9,ATTORNEY>And if you attempt to contact my client or his family again

735
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,740
<37-9,ATTORNEY>与我的当事人及其家人联系
<37-9,ATTORNEY>without first notifying my office,

736
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,680
<37-9,ATTORNEY>我们会起诉警局骚扰
<37-9,ATTORNEY>we'll sue the department for harassment.

737
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,230
<37-10,BECKETT>好了  行了
<37-10,BECKETT>All right. Okay.

738
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,420
<37-10,BECKETT>我们明白
<37-10,BECKETT>We got it.

739
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,190
<38-1,GATES>这是你们第二次无凭无据去找李一家
<38-1,GATES>This is the second time you've gone at the Lees with nothing.

740
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,320
<38-1,GATES>现在菲利普·李请了律师
<38-1,GATES>Now Philip Lee has lawyered up,

741
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,180
<38-1,GATES>他很可能已经把枪脱手了
<38-1,GATES>he's probably gotten rid of the gun,

742
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,070
<38-1,GATES>加上四名家庭成员  和众多佣人
<38-1,GATES>and he has four family members and various household help

743
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,270
<38-1,GATES>愿意为他提供案发当时的不在场证明
<38-1,GATES>willing to alibi him for the time of the murder.

744
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,160
<38-2,RYAN>手机信号显示他当时就在
<38-2,RYAN>The cell phone puts him in the vicinity

745
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,920
<38-2,RYAN>-案发现场附近  -附近
<38-2,RYAN>- of the murder scene. - Vicinity?

746
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,840
<38-4,CASTLE>芬恩·麦奎恩说过
<38-4,CASTLE>Finn McQueen said--

747
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,400
<38-5,GATES>芬恩·麦奎恩无法证实究竟发生了什么  卡塞尔
<38-5,GATES>Finn McQueen cannot testify to what happened, Castle.

748
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,970
<38-5,GATES>他不在现场
<38-5,GATES>He wasn't there.

749
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,020
<38-5,GATES>要有证据
<38-5,GATES>Make your case.

750
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,120
<38-5,GATES>但搜集证据
<38-5,GATES>But you do it now,

751
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,660
<38-5,GATES>不能骚扰李一家
<38-5,GATES>without harassing the Lee family.

752
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,760
<38-6,BECKETT>长官  我们需要对他们施压
<38-6,BECKETT>Sir, we need to keep leaning on them.

753
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,280
<38-6,BECKETT>我们要趁热打铁
<38-6,BECKETT>We need to keep the heat on.

754
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,090
<38-7,GATES>不行  你们得另想办法  这是命令
<38-7,GATES>No. You need to stay away, and that's an order.

755
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,740
<38-8,RYAN>难道要我们写下杀死简的凶手的名字
<38-8,RYAN>So what, we just write the name of Jane's killer

756
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,200
<38-8,RYAN>就这么放他走吗
<38-8,RYAN>in a file and we let him walk free?

757
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,210
<38-8,RYAN>我们是警察  不是文书
<38-8,RYAN>That makes us clerks, not cops.

758
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,280
<38-9,GATES>回家休息  莱恩
<38-9,GATES>Take the rest of the day off, Ryan.

759
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,030
<38-9,GATES>你需要清醒清醒
<38-9,GATES>You need to clear your head.

760
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,970
<39-1,ESPOSITO>这还没完  伙计
<39-1,ESPOSITO>It's not over yet, bro.

761
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,660
<39-2,RYAN>我们只是需要找到证人
<39-2,RYAN>We just need someone to go on record,

762
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,540
<39-2,RYAN>知道当晚究竟发生了什么的人
<39-2,RYAN>someone who knows what happened that night.

763
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,180
<39-3,CASTLE>是啊  唯一清楚此事的人就是菲利普·李
<39-3,CASTLE>Yeah. The only one who really knows is Philip Lee.

764
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,500
<39-4,ESPOSITO>你去哪
<39-4,ESPOSITO>Where you going?

765
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,190
<39-5,RYAN>遵照警监说的
<39-5,RYAN>I'm gonna do just like the captain said,

766
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,660
<39-5,RYAN>给自己放天假
<39-5,RYAN>take the rest of the day off.

767
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,630
<40-1,ESPOSITO>无论你去哪  我跟你一起去
<40-1,ESPOSITO>Wherever you're going, I'm going with you.

768
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,380
<40-2,RYAN>这是我的执拗
<40-2,RYAN>It's my fight.

769
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,200
<40-3,ESPOSITO>你不想让我卷进来
<40-3,ESPOSITO>And you don't want me getting involved.

770
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,640
<40-3,ESPOSITO>可这也是我的案子
<40-3,ESPOSITO>It's my case, too.

771
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,620
<40-4,ESPOSITO>你是我的搭档
<40-4,ESPOSITO>And you're my partner.

772
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,840
<40-5,RYAN>我要去问问本·李
<40-5,RYAN>I'm taking a run at Ben Lee.

773
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,600
<40-6,ESPOSITO>李家一定会把他关起来
<40-6,ESPOSITO>The Lees will have him locked down.

774
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,390
<40-6,ESPOSITO>我打赌他老爹一定不会让他单独跑出来
<40-6,ESPOSITO>I'm betting his old man won't let him go out in public alone.

775
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,320
<40-6,ESPOSITO>那么
<40-6,ESPOSITO>Then...

776
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,680
<40-7,RYAN>我想一身警察装扮是进不去的
<40-7,RYAN>I guess we can't go in there looking like cops.

<41-14,BEN>Jane is dead.

797
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,620
<41-15,RYAN>怎么  你们之间的一切也都死了吗
<41-15,RYAN>So you let it all just die with her?

798
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,300
<41-15,RYAN>发生了什么
<41-15,RYAN>What happened, huh?

799
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,750
<41-15,RYAN>上大学也许让你觉得

00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,550
<41-15,RYAN>出去闯闯会比
<41-15,RYAN>that there's something better out there

801
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,700
<41-15,RYAN>当个低劣毒贩子强得多
<41-15,RYAN>than being just a low-life drug dealer?

802
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,500
<41-15,RYAN>简真的让你动了心
<41-15,RYAN>Jane made you really want to try?

803
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,790

<41-16,RYAN>我保证  你会很安全
<41-16,RYAN>And I promise, you'll be safe.

805
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,620
<41-17,BEN>你们警察的保证都是胡言
<41-17,BEN>You cops and your promises, man.

806
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,150
<41-17,BEN>卡沃向简保证她会没事
<41-17,BEN>Carver promised Jane she'd be safe.

807
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,470
<41-17,BEN>可结果呢
<41-17,BEN>Look what happened.

<41-19,RYAN>简为了你的抗争而死
<41-19,RYAN>Jane died fighting your battle.

811
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,760
<41-19,RYAN>我知道你可以用更好的方式纪念她
<41-19,RYAN>I know you can honor her better than this.

812
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,630
<41-19,RYAN>本  你没事吧
<41-19,RYAN>Ben, you okay?

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,710
<41-20,RYAN>你知道怎么找我
<41-20,RYAN>You know how to find me.

814
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,400
<42-1,BECKETT>你们俩究竟是怎么想的
<42-1,BECKETT>What the hell were you two thinking,

815
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,690
<42-1,BECKETT>在盖茨明说了要"另想办法"之后
<42-1,BECKETT>going to see Ben Lee when Gates specifically

<42-2,ESPOSITO>谁会让她知道呢  贝克特  反正不是我
<42-2,ESPOSITO>Who's gonna tell her, Beckett? Not me.

818
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,250
<42-2,ESPOSITO>莱恩  你打算向警监打小报告吗
<42-2,ESPOSITO>Ryan, are you planning on telling the Captain what we did?

819
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,420
<42-3,RYAN>我不会  卡塞尔呢
<42-3,RYAN>Not me. Castle?

00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,630
<42-4,CASTLE>算你狠  臭屁小子
<42-4,CASTLE>Nice, smart-ass.

822
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,400
<42-5,BECKETT>那要是本·李告诉了他爸爸
<42-5,BECKETT>And what about when Ben Lee tells his daddy

823
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,130
<42-5,BECKETT>他们的律师又打电话给盖茨呢
<42-5,BECKETT>and Gates gets a phone call from their lawyer?

824
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,490
<42-5,BECKETT>你俩会被停职的
<42-5,BECKETT>You two are gonna get benched.

825
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,930
<42-6,RYAN>本·李不会告诉他父亲的
<42-6,RYAN>Ben Lee's not gonna tell his father.

826
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,640
<42-7,BECKETT>-你怎么知道  -因为
<42-7,BECKETT>- How do you know? - Because...

827
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,650
<42-8,RYAN>我看着他的眼睛  我看到了他承受的痛苦
<42-8,RYAN>I looked him in the eye and I saw the pain he's in.

828
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,400
<42-8,RYAN>也许他不够有勇气站出来
<42-8,RYAN>Maybe he's not man enough to stand up for himself,

829
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,320
<42-8,RYAN>但是他也不会出卖我
<42-8,RYAN>but he's not gonna rat me out, either.

830
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,000
<42-9,BECKETT>你们真是太冒险了
<42-9,BECKETT>You guys took a hell of a chance.

831
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,180
<42-10,RYAN>贝克特  你的语气像个头儿了
<42-10,RYAN>Beckett, you're starting to sound like a boss.

832
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,360
<42-11,BECKETT>下次不要擅自行动  我也好...
<42-11,BECKETT>Just let me know next time so I can help--

833
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,550
<42-12,GATES>莱恩警探
<42-12,GATES>Detective Ryan.

834
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,300
<42-13,GATES>有人找你
<42-13,GATES>There's someone here to see you.

835
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,220
<43-1,PHILLIP>爸爸说你在楼下
<43-1,PHILLIP>Papa said you were down here.

836
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,170
<43-1,PHILLIP>你现在上大四了  不必这么用功
<43-1,PHILLIP>Ah, you're a senior now. You don't need to work this hard.

837
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,170
<43-2,BEN>我周一有考试
<43-2,BEN>I have a test on Monday.

838
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,330
<43-3,PHILLIP>别管它了  我们出去逛逛
<43-3,PHILLIP>Blow it off. We'll go out.

839
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,080
<43-4,BEN>我不想去
<43-4,BEN>I don't want to go.

840
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,330
<43-4,BEN>菲利普
<43-4,BEN>Philip.

841
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,330
<43-5,BEN>如果不是他们发现了简的尸体
<43-5,BEN>If they hadn't found Jane,

842
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,880
<43-5,BEN>如果她还被掩埋着
<43-5,BEN>if she'd stayed hidden...

843
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,260
<43-5,BEN>我就永远不会知道她已经死了
<43-5,BEN>I never would've known what happened to her.

844
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,170
<43-5,BEN>你真的想让我就那样被蒙在鼓里吗
<43-5,BEN>Would you really have let me wonder for the rest of my life?

845
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,990
<43-6,PHILLIP>有时候不知道真相  反而更好
<43-6,PHILLIP>Sometimes it's a gift, not knowing the truth.

846
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,150
<43-7,BEN>所以说如果她只是失踪  我就会相信
<43-7,BEN>So if she were just missing, I could believe that

847
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,620
<43-7,BEN>她还在别处好好活着吗
<43-7,BEN>she were alive somewhere?

848
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,410
<43-7,BEN>我就可以假装...
<43-7,BEN>I could pretend...

849
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,130
<43-7,BEN>像小孩那样
<43-7,BEN>Like a child?

850
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,100
<43-7,BEN>可她不是失踪了
<43-7,BEN>But she's not missing!

851
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,570
<44-1,ESPOSITO>情况不妙
<44-1,ESPOSITO>I don't like this.

852
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,280
<44-2,CASTLE>本应该诱导菲利普招供
<44-2,CASTLE>Ben is supposed to lead Philip to a confession,

853
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,550
<44-2,CASTLE>而不是逼迫他认罪
<44-2,CASTLE>not forces him to confession.

854
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,390
<44-3,BECKETT>给他点时间
<44-3,BECKETT>You guys, just give him a minute.

855
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,470
<44-3,BECKETT>她死了
<44-3,BECKETT>She's dead,

856
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,170
<45-1,BEN>我不再是个孩子了
<45-1,BEN>and I'm not a child.

857
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,730
<45-2,PHILLIP>时间久了
<45-2,PHILLIP>In time,

858
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,160
<45-2,PHILLIP>你就会知道  这是为你好
<45-2,PHILLIP>you'll see, it was for the best.

859
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,520
<46-1,ESPOSITO>菲利普在闪烁其辞
<46-1,ESPOSITO>Philip's dancing around it.

860
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,180
<46-2,BECKETT>听着  一旦他认罪
<46-2,BECKETT>Look, the second he acknowledges guilt,

861
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,030
<46-2,BECKETT>我们就冲进去
<46-2,BECKETT>we're moving in.

862
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,380
<46-2,BECKETT>快点  快点
<46-2,BECKETT>Come on. Come on.

863
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,060
<46-2,BECKETT>她哭了吗  她有问起我吗
<46-2,BECKETT>Did she cry? Did she ask for me?

864
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,380
<47-1,BEN>本
<47-1,BEN>Ben.

865
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,050
<47-2,PHILLIP>别这样
<47-2,PHILLIP>Don't do this.

866
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,130
<47-3,BEN>我要知道
<47-3,BEN>I need to know.

867
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,990
<47-4,PHILLIP>你脑子现在不清楚
<47-4,PHILLIP>You're not thinking clearly.

868
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,540
<47-4,PHILLIP>我们明天再谈
<47-4,PHILLIP>We'll talk about this tomorrow.

869
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,100
<47-5,BEN>如果你不把真相告诉我
<47-5,BEN>If you don't tell me everything,

870
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,870
<47-5,BEN>我们再也不是兄弟了
<47-5,BEN>we can no longer be brothers.

871
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,700
<47-6,PHILLIP>你戴着窃听器吗
<47-6,PHILLIP>You wearing a wire?

872
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:05,320
<48-1,BECKETT>莱恩  他起疑心了
<48-1,BECKETT>Ryan, he's tipping.

873
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,500
<48-2,RYAN>或许本可以扭转局面
<48-2,RYAN>Maybe Ben can turn it around.

874
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,640
<48-3,BECKETT>不行  我们得赶快把他救出来
<48-3,BECKETT>No, we have to pull him out now.

875
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,630
<48-4,RYAN>再等等
<48-4,RYAN>Just...

876
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,030
<48-4,RYAN>窃听器  什么意思
<48-4,RYAN>Wire. What is this?

877
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,500
<49-1,PHILLIP>让我看看
<49-1,PHILLIP>Let me see.

878
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,370
<49-1,PHILLIP>把衣服敞开我瞧瞧
<49-1,PHILLIP>Open your shirt.

879
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,140
<49-2,BEN>-我不需要向你证明什么  -本
<49-2,BEN>- I don't need to prove anything to you. - Ben!

880
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,440
<49-2,BEN>我的好弟弟  这是你最后的机会
<49-2,BEN>This is your last chance, little brother.

881
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,890
<50-1,PHILLIP>把衣服敞开
<50-1,PHILLIP>Show me.

882
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,690
<50-1,PHILLIP>行动  快点
<50-1,PHILLIP>Let's go. Let's move.

883
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,530
<50-1,PHILLIP>你要像杀死简一样
<50-1,PHILLIP>You gonna shoot me now,

884
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,040
<52-1,BEN>杀死我吗
<52-1,BEN>like you did to Jane?

885
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,770
<52-2,PHILLIP>别逼我
<52-2,PHILLIP>Don't push me.

886
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,120
<52-3,BEN>去死
<52-3,BEN>Go to hell.

887
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,530
<52-4,BEN>把手举起来
<52-4,BEN>Get 'em up!

888
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,440
<52-5,RYAN>趴下
<52-5,RYAN>Down!

889
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,400
<52-5,RYAN>叛徒  叛徒
<52-5,RYAN>Traitor! Traitor.

892
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,080
<52-4,BEN>你毁了我的人生
<52-4,BEN>You ruined my life!

893
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,090
<52-7,PHILLIP>不要  本

<52-7,PHILLIP>Call it in. Rush the bus.

902
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,710
<52-7,PHILLIP>救护车已经在路上了
<52-7,PHILLIP>They're on the way.

903
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,350
<52-7,PHILLIP>本

904
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,950
<52-7,PHILLIP>对不起
<52-7,PHILLIP>I'm so sorry.

905
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,900
<52-7,PHILLIP>该死  对不起
<52-7,PHILLIP>Damn it. I am so sorry.

906
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,160
<52-7,PHILLIP>上帝啊  真的很抱歉
<52-7,PHILLIP>Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

907
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,430
<53-1,BECKETT>录音带上的内容已足以使陪审团
<53-1,BECKETT>There's enough on a tape to sway a jury

908
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,260
<53-1,BECKETT>排除一切合理怀疑
<53-1,BECKETT>from reasonable doubt.

909
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,830
<53-1,BECKETT>我们在你车子里找到的可卡因与
<53-1,BECKETT>And the coke that we found in your car

910
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,070
<53-1,BECKETT>在简尸体上发现的残留物是吻合的
<53-1,BECKETT>is a match for the residue found on Jane's body.

911
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,160
<53-1,BECKETT>而且
<53-1,BECKETT>And then...

912
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,650
<53-2,BECKETT>还有这把枪
<53-2,BECKETT>There's this.

913
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,520
<53-2,BECKETT>这把你刚指着你弟弟的枪
<53-2,BECKETT>The gun that you pointed at your brother.

914
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,550
<53-2,BECKETT>莱恩警探已经认出
<53-2,BECKETT>Detective Ryan positively identified it

915
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,300
<53-2,BECKETT>是他被偷的警枪
<53-2,BECKETT>as his stolen service weapon.

916
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,020
<53-2,BECKETT>同时它也是
<53-2,BECKETT>It is also the same gun

917
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,400
<53-2,BECKETT>杀死简·赫茨菲尔德的凶枪
<53-2,BECKETT>that was used to kill Jane Herzfeld.

918
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,700
<53-3,BECKETT>你将被控一级谋杀
<53-3,BECKETT>You're looking at murder one,

919
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,320
<53-3,BECKETT>终生不得假释
<53-3,BECKETT>life with no parole.

920
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,830
<53-4,ATTORNEY>我的当事人有些你们可能会感兴趣的信息
<53-4,ATTORNEY>My client has some information that might interest the NYPD.

921
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,270
<53-5,BECKETT>什么信息
<53-5,BECKETT>What kind of information?

922
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,160
<53-6,PHILLIP>杰瑞·泰森
<53-6,PHILLIP>Jerry Tyson.

923
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,290
<53-6,PHILLIP>3XK
<53-6,PHILLIP>3XK.

924
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,030
<53-7,BECKETT>你知道些什么
<53-7,BECKETT>What about him?

925
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,110
<53-8,PHILLIP>他给我枪的时候  我们有谈过
<53-8,PHILLIP>When he gave me the gun, we talked.

926
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,340
<53-8,PHILLIP>我知道他会往哪逃
<53-8,PHILLIP>I know where he was headed,

927
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,710
<53-8,PHILLIP>他会用什么假名
<53-8,PHILLIP>and what name he's gonna use.

928
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,730
<54-1,BECKETT>李想以15到20年有期徒刑
<54-1,BECKETT>So Lee wants 15 to 25

929
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,510
<54-1,BECKETT>十年后准许假释
<54-1,BECKETT>with parole in ten

930
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,540
<54-1,BECKETT>作为交换泰森新化名的条件
<54-1,BECKETT>for giving us Tyson's new alias.

931
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,830
<54-1,BECKETT>我会跟副地检官建议此认罪协议
<54-1,BECKETT>I need to give the A.D.A. a recommendation.

932
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,640
<54-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这也许就是我们抓住3XK的机会
<54-1,BECKETT>This might be our chance to get 3XK, Castle.

933
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,610
<54-1,BECKETT>不是
<54-1,BECKETT>No.

934
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,520
<54-2,CASTLE>这是他下的套
<54-2,CASTLE>It's a setup.

935
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,800
<54-2,CASTLE>杰瑞·泰森把枪交给菲利普·李时
<54-2,CASTLE>Jerry Tyson gave that gun to Philip Lee

936
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,090
<54-2,CASTLE>就知道他肯定会用这把枪
<54-2,CASTLE>knowing he would use it,

937
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,960
<54-2,CASTLE>很有可能  他也知道
<54-2,CASTLE>so there's a good chance he knew

938
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,690
<54-2,CASTLE>最终我们会抓到菲利普
<54-2,CASTLE>we'd eventually get to Philip.

939
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,260
<54-3,BECKETT>也许吧  那又怎样
<54-3,BECKETT>Maybe. So what?

940
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,850
<54-4,CASTLE>所以泰森对菲利普说的一切都是假的
<54-4,CASTLE>So nothing Tyson told Philip would be the truth.

941
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,270
<54-4,CASTLE>如果菲利普·李
<54-4,CASTLE>Giving Philip Lee

942
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,760
<54-5,CASTLE>能用假信息换取一份满意的认罪协议
<54-5,CASTLE>a good deal for bad information,

943
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,680
<54-5,CASTLE>那样杰瑞·泰森就又赢了我们一次
<54-5,CASTLE>that's just another win for Jerry Tyson.

944
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,270
<54-6,BECKETT>你确定吗
<54-6,BECKETT>Are you sure?

945
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
<54-7,CASTLE>我肯定
<54-7,CASTLE>Sure enough.

946
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,940
<54-7,CASTLE>简·赫茨菲尔德理应得到公正
<54-7,CASTLE>Jane Herzfeld deserves justice.

947
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,140
<54-7,CASTLE>菲利普·李终身监禁
<54-7,CASTLE>Life in prison for Philip Lee.

948
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,300
<54-7,CASTLE>没得谈
<54-7,CASTLE>No deals.

949
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,510
<54-8,CASTLE>我们会抓到3XK的
<54-8,CASTLE>We'll get 3XK.

950
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,450
<54-8,CASTLE>通过自己的调查
<54-8,CASTLE>And we'll do it right.

951
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,650
<54-9,BECKETT>不错嘛  卡塞尔
<54-9,BECKETT>Damn, Castle.

<54-9,BECKETT>看看你  已经像个真警察了
<54-9,BECKETT>Look at you, thinking like a real cop.

953
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,820
<55-1,BECKETT>伙计们
<55-1,BECKETT>Hey, guys.

<55-2,RYAN>我一直在想赛斯·卡沃
<55-2,RYAN>Well, I keep thinking about Seth Carver,

957
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,730
<55-2,RYAN>把简独自一人送进李家
<55-2,RYAN>sending Jane into the Lees', all alone,

958
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,030
<55-2,RYAN>根本没有后援
<55-2,RYAN>with no backup.

959
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,830
<55-2,RYAN>我真的算个好警察吗
<55-2,RYAN>Do I really get to call myself a better cop?

960
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,530
<55-3,CASTLE>你绝对是个好警察  凯文

<55-3,CASTLE>You're a better man,

962
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,990
<55-3,CASTLE>因为你没让本独自面对危险
<55-3,CASTLE>because you didn't send him in there alone.
