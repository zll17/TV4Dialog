83
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,380
<3-4,BECKETT>当时  我只想知道真相
<3-4,BECKETT>And when I was, what I needed most was the truth.

84
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,530
<3-4,BECKETT>我

85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
<3-5,COONAN>我在阿富汗建学校

<3-5,COONAN>我广受赞誉
<3-5,COONAN>I get all this recognition.

<3-5,COONAN>可我的哥哥杰克
<3-5,COONAN>And here's my big brother Jacky,

89
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,350
<3-5,COONAN>正是他教会我为弱者出头
<3-5,COONAN>the guy who taught me to fight for the little guy...

90
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,930
<3-5,COONAN>他又得到了什么
<3-5,COONAN>and what does he get?

91
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,610
<3-6,BECKETT>他罪不至此
<3-6,BECKETT>Worse than he deserved.

92
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,920
<3-7,COONAN>我不是为他的所做所为找借口
<3-7,COONAN>I make no excuses for the things my brother did,

93
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,240
<3-7,COONAN>但在成长过程中  我们只能靠自己
<3-7,COONAN>but growing up, we were on our own a lot.

<3-7,COONAN>杰克是街上最厉害的小孩
<3-7,COONAN>Jacky was the toughest kid on the block.

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,070
<3-7,COONAN>也正因为这样  引起了洛克的注意
<3-7,COONAN>That's what first brought him to Rourke's attention.

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,210
<3-8,BECKETT>冯·洛克

<3-10,BECKETT>那你哥哥为冯做什么工作
<3-10,BECKETT>What did he actually do for Finn?

100
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,750
<3-11,COONAN>杰克从来没说过
<3-11,COONAN>Jacky never said.

101
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,560
<3-11,COONAN>不管他是做什么的
<3-11,COONAN>But whatever it was...

102
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,890
<3-11,COONAN>都因此害他丧命
<3-11,COONAN>pretty sure it got him killed.

103
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,070
<3-11,COONAN>卡塞尔

<4-1,BECKETT>你确定不要留在车里等吗
<4-1,BECKETT>so you sure you don't want to stay in the car?

106

<6-2,CASTLE>Congratulations.

141
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,040
<6-3,BECKETT>我手上有个西部联盟成员被杀的案子
<6-3,BECKETT>I've got a dead Westie on my hands.

142
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
<6-3,BECKETT>看起来你脱不了干系
<6-3,BECKETT>And it looked like you were about to join.

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,190
<6-3,BECKETT>告诉我你在冯·洛克酒吧的休息室做什么
<6-3,BECKETT>So you want to tell me what you were doing in Finn Rourke's back room?

144
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,410
<6-4,MENDOZA>我可以讲真话吗
<6-4,MENDOZA>Can I be real with you?

145
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,260
<6-5,BECKETT>-请讲  -我喝太多了
<6-5,BECKETT>- Oh, please do. - I had too much to drink

146
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,950
<6-6,MENDOZA>然后我一不小心就摔倒了
<6-6,MENDOZA>and I accidentally fell.

147
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,320
<6-7,BECKETT>-你摔倒了  -我摔倒了
<6-7,BECKETT>- You fell? - I fell.

148
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,060
<6-9,BECKETT>那你眼睛上的伤怎么来的
<6-9,BECKETT>Well, then how'd you get that mouse on your eye?

149
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,580
<6-10,MENDOZA>我撞到墙上了
<6-10,MENDOZA>I ran into the wall.

150
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,640
<6-11,CASTLE>那你的手又是怎么烧伤的
<6-11,CASTLE>How'd you burn your hand?

151
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,840
<6-12,MENDOZA>我撞到墙后就摔倒了
<6-12,MENDOZA>After I ran into the wall and I fell,

152
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,150
<6-12,MENDOZA>我把手撑在烤架上
<6-12,MENDOZA>I put my hand out on the grill,

153
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,580
<6-12,MENDOZA>防止摔倒
<6-12,MENDOZA>just to break my fall.

154
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,960
<6-13,CASTLE>那么谢谢你的真话
<6-13,CASTLE>Well, thanks for keeping it real.

155
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,900
<6-14,BECKETT>听着  我明白
<6-14,BECKETT>Look, I get it--

156
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,430
<6-14,BECKETT>这些所谓出来混的规矩
<6-14,BECKETT>the whole "Street code" thing and all.

157
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,230
<6-14,BECKETT>依我的经验  马里奥  像你这样的
<6-14,BECKETT>But in my experience, Mario, guys like you

158
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,330
<6-14,BECKETT>早晚又会因为什么被逮住
<6-14,BECKETT>end up catching another case sooner or later,

159
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,230
<6-14,BECKETT>在你被逮住的时候
<6-14,BECKETT>and when you do,

160
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,630
<6-14,BECKETT>难道你不想有个探长罩着你吗
<6-14,BECKETT>wouldn't you like to have a Detective on your side?

161
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,310
<6-15,MENDOZA>不用了  谢谢
<6-15,MENDOZA>No, thanks.

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,430
<6-15,MENDOZA>我舒服着呢
<6-15,MENDOZA>I'm good.

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
<6-16,OFFICER GILBERT MAZZARA>上次是我抓的他
<6-16,OFFICER GILBERT MAZZARA>He was my collar from back in the day.

164
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,220
<6-16,OFFICER GILBERT MAZZARA>他替拉丁之王贩毒
<6-16,OFFICER GILBERT MAZZARA>Guy ran dope for the Latin Kings.

165
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,310
<6-18,BECKETT>-拉丁之王  -是一个街头暴力帮派
<6-18,BECKETT>- Latin Kings? - It's a violent street gang.

166
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,220
<6-18,BECKETT>主要贩卖妇女与毒品
<6-18,BECKETT>They mostly peddle girls and drugs.

167
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,900
<6-19,MAZZARA>朱雀是他们的打手
<6-19,MAZZARA>Yeah, Trucho's their blade man

168
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,820
<6-19,MAZZARA>用刀高手
<6-19,MAZZARA>real handy with the knife.

169
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,070
<6-19,MAZZARA>并未因谋杀被抓过
<6-19,MAZZARA>We never popped him for murder,

170
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,560
<6-19,MAZZARA>但是被他弄得手指头少几根的很多
<6-19,MAZZARA>but, uh, I met plenty of folks with fingers missing.

171
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,730
<6-20,CASTLE>这么说这两个帮派间有过节
<6-20,CASTLE>So was there bad blood between them?

172
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,490
<6-21,MAZZARA>他们两帮就像
<6-21,MAZZARA>Yeah, they're like the, uh,

173
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,220
<6-21,MAZZARA>"地狱厨房"一般狗咬狗
<6-21,MAZZARA>Hatfields and McCoys of Hell's Kitchen.

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,170
<6-22,BECKETT>西部联盟觉得是拉丁之王杀了库南
<6-22,BECKETT>So the Westies figure that the Latin Kings killed Coonan,

175
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,780
<6-22,BECKETT>于是他们抓了拉丁之王的打手
<6-22,BECKETT>and they snatch their blade guy and bring him in

176
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,380
<6-22,BECKETT>对他进行拷问
<6-22,BECKETT>for a little enhanced interrogation.

177
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,660
<6-23,CASTLE>但这事没人愿意承担责任
<6-23,CASTLE>Which no one wants to admit to.

178
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,110
<6-24,BECKETT>依我的经验来看
<6-24,BECKETT>Uh-huh. Look, my experience--

179
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,570
<6-25,MAZZARA>如果冯冲着他去  肯定是有原因的
<6-25,MAZZARA>if Finn went all get on him, it was for a reason.

180
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,110
<6-25,MAZZARA>西部联盟成员尸体上如果有窟窿
<6-25,MAZZARA>You got a Westie with holes in him,

181
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,870
<6-25,MAZZARA>朱雀很有可能就是凶手
<6-25,MAZZARA>Trucho's probably your guy.

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,190
<6-26,ESPOSITO>他说得没错  我们找到了朱雀的车
<6-26,ESPOSITO>He's right. We found Trucho's vehicle

183
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,300
<6-26,ESPOSITO>停在雷哥公园里的小酒吧后巷
<6-26,ESPOSITO>in an alley behind a little bodega in Rego Park.

184
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,400
<6-26,ESPOSITO>那里经常有毒品交易
<6-26,ESPOSITO>It's a big dope spot.

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,840
<6-27,RYAN>他把他的"开信刀"
<6-27,RYAN>And he left his little letter opener

186
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,810
<6-27,RYAN>塞在了汽车防晒板后面
<6-27,RYAN>tucked behind the driver's side sun visor.

187
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,460
<6-28,LANIE>这不是凶器
<6-28,LANIE>That's not it.

188
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,940
<6-29,BECKETT>-你看都没看  -我看了
<6-29,BECKETT>- You didn't even look. - Sure I did.

189
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,240
<6-30,LANIE>这是把匕首  4英寸的大马士革钢刀
<6-30,LANIE>It's a stiletto, 4-inch Damascus blade,

190
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,090
<6-30,LANIE>对于这些伤口来说这把刀太小了
<6-30,LANIE>and it's way too small to make these wounds.

191
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,640
<6-31,CASTLE>也许凶手用了不同的刀
<6-31,CASTLE>Well, maybe he used a different knife.

192
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,370
<6-32,LANIE>这个朱雀有多高
<6-32,LANIE>Just how tall is this Trucho?

193
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,900
<6-23,CASTLE>他有
<6-23,CASTLE>He's, uh...

194
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
<6-24,BECKETT>5英尺6英寸(167CM)
<6-24,BECKETT>5'6".

195
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,290
<6-34,CASTLE>-踮着脚才有  -那么他就不是凶手
<6-34,CASTLE>- Standing on his toes. - Then he's not your guy.

196
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,650
<6-35,LANIE>这些伤口的行成角度
<6-35,LANIE>Thrust angle on these wounds

197
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,490
<6-35,LANIE>显示杀害库南的凶手高于6英尺(182CM)
<6-35,LANIE>indicate Coonan's killer was over 6'.

198
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,010
<6-36,CASTLE>也许凶手没有用匕首
<6-36,CASTLE>Well, maybe instead of using a stiletto,

199
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,260
<6-36,CASTLE>他只是穿了细高跟鞋[与匕首同词]
<6-36,CASTLE>he was wearing stilettos.

200
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,020
<6-37,BECKETT>抱歉
<6-37,BECKETT>Excuse me.

202
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,890
<6-39,LANIE>你还好吧
<6-39,LANIE>You okay?

203
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,220
<6-40,CASTLE>我没事
<6-40,CASTLE>Yeah, I'm fine.

204
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,290
<6-42,BECKETT>鉴证人员在库南的手机上有发现
<6-42,BECKETT>Tech's got some hits off of Coonan's phone.

205
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,760
<6-42,BECKETT>可能会有点突破
<6-42,BECKETT>Maybe they can shed some light.

206
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,320
<6-42,BECKETT>谢谢了  蕾妮
<6-42,BECKETT>Thank you, Lanie.

207
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,930
<7-1,RYAN>最后一个电话
<7-1,RYAN>The last call

208
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,640
<7-1,RYAN>库南是打给纽约的一处固定电话
<7-1,RYAN>that Coonan made was to a New York landline.

209
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,900
<7-1,RYAN>因为内存卡损坏了
<7-1,RYAN>Because of the damage to the SIM,

210
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,980
<7-1,RYAN>号码中最后两位无法得知
<7-1,RYAN>it's missing the last two digits of the phone number.

211
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,830
<7-2,CASTLE>那就是有99种组合可能
<7-2,CASTLE>Well, that's 99 possibilities.

212
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,670
<7-2,CASTLE>我们快点开始试吧  莱恩  我是说你开始
<7-2,CASTLE>We better get dialing. Ryan, I'm looking at you.

213
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,850
<7-3,ESPOSITO>不必了  所有组合的号码都属于同一号码源
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Well, no, the numbers are all from the same phone tree.

214
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,650
<7-4,RYAN>接下来就更有意思了
<7-4,RYAN>Here's where it gets interesting.

215
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,870
<7-4,RYAN>所有号码都属于
<7-4,RYAN>They all trace back to the New York office

216
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,960
<7-4,RYAN>联调局纽约分部的
<7-4,RYAN>of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

217
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,470
<7-5,BECKETT>一个爱尔兰街头恶棍
<7-5,BECKETT>What's an irish street thug doing

218
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,530
<7-5,BECKETT>和联调局的能谈什么
<7-5,BECKETT>talking to the FBI?

219
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,660
<7-6,JOHNNY VONG>我的计划很简单  连傻瓜都懂
<7-6,JOHNNY VONG>My program is idiot-proof.

220
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,180
<7-6,JOHNNY VONG>看我  我从未上过大学
<7-6,JOHNNY VONG>Look at me. I never went to college.

221
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,240
<7-7,ESPOSITO>贝克特  联邦探员到了
<7-7,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett. Your FBI agent's here.

222
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,980
<7-6,JOHNNY VONG>我是看《炮弹飞车》的录影带学英语
<7-6,JOHNNY VONG>I learn English from V.H.S. Copy of "Cannonball Run"...

223
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,020
<7-8,BECKETT>这套DVD不是证物吗
<7-8,BECKETT>Wasn't that DVD supposed to be booked in as possible evidence?

224
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,470
<7-9,RYAN>没错  但是我想可能有线索
<7-9,RYAN>Yeah, but, you know, I thought the might be something--

225
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,720
<7-10,BECKETT>放回去
<7-10,BECKETT>Put it back.

226
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,270
<7-10,BECKETT>好吧
<7-10,BECKETT>Okay.

227
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,210
<7-12,BECKETT>福瑞斯特探员  感谢您大驾光临
<7-12,BECKETT>I appreciate your coming down, agent Forrest.

228
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,900
<7-12,BECKETT>您的多数同僚会要求警局警员配合查案
<7-12,BECKETT>Most of your FBI colleagues would expect the locals to come to them.

229
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,480
<7-13,AGENT FORREST>我的多数同事只担心洗发水和记者招待会
<7-13,AGENT FORREST>Most of my colleagues worry about hair products and press conferences

230
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,330
<7-13,AGENT FORREST>其实他们应该出去捉拿犯人
<7-13,AGENT FORREST>when they should be out catching bad men.

231
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,680
<7-14,CASTLE>我想您不是那样的人
<7-14,CASTLE>I take it you're not from around these parts.

232
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,540
<7-14,CASTLE>当然不是  先生
<7-14,CASTLE>No, sir.

233
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,070
<7-15,FORREST>我不是  但是因为我的过错
<7-15,FORREST>I'm not. But for my many sins,

234
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,580
<7-15,FORREST>联调局把我调到纽约分部
<7-15,FORREST>the Bureau has transferred me here to New York.

235
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,190
<7-16,BECKETT>您是怎么接触到杰克·库南的
<7-16,BECKETT>How did you come into contact with Jack Coonan?

236
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,790
<7-17,FORREST>约一周前  他找到我们
<7-17,FORREST>He reached out to us about a week ago.

237
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,350
<7-18,CASTLE>您就雇佣他为线人
<7-18,CASTLE>And you signed him on as an informant.

238
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,260
<7-19,FORREST>没有
<7-19,FORREST>Nope.

239
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,410
<7-20,BECKETT>为什么不
<7-20,BECKETT>Why not?

240
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,920
<7-21,FORREST>这样的人太多了
<7-21,FORREST>'cause all there were overtures.

241
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,840
<7-21,FORREST>我不指望
<7-21,FORREST>And I wasn't about to

242
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,390
<7-21,FORREST>用母牛换仙豆[童话《杰克和仙豆》]
<7-21,FORREST>trade the family cow for a bunch of magic beans.

243
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,710
<7-22,CASTLE>你不相信他
<7-22,CASTLE>You didn't trust him?

244
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,060
<7-23,FORREST>库南这种人找联调局
<7-23,FORREST>When a case like Coonan reaches out to the Bureau,

245
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,540
<7-23,FORREST>通常是因为和老板作对
<7-23,FORREST>it's usually 'cause he crossed his bosses.

246
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,000
<7-24,BECKETT>他手头紧  想和联调局交易
<7-24,BECKETT>And he's hard up to trade them in to the Bureau

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,300
<7-24,BECKETT>尽快加入证人保护计划
<7-24,BECKETT>for a quick trip into the waiting arms of Witsec.

248
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,160
<7-25,CASTLE>库南揭发的谁
<7-25,CASTLE>Who was Coonan offering up?

249
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,270
<7-26,FORREST>并未知晓
<7-26,FORREST>Never found out.

250
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,280
<7-27,CASTLE>肯定有人听到风声
<7-27,CASTLE>Well, whoever it was must have gotten wind of it.

251
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
<7-28,BECKETT>在库南向联调局告发前
<7-28,BECKETT>And then killed Coonan before he had a chance

252
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,540
<7-28,BECKETT>将他杀害
<7-28,BECKETT>to deliver them to the FBI.

253
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,850
<7-29,FORREST>西部联盟有点像流氓国家伊朗
<7-29,FORREST>The Westies are a bit like the rogue state of Iran

254
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,120
<7-29,FORREST>也像伟大的德克萨斯州
<7-29,FORREST>and the great state of Texas.

255
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,310
<7-29,FORREST>对于判决死刑  他们绝不心慈手软
<7-29,FORREST>They're not too shy in handing out the death penalty.

256
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,550
<7-30,BECKETT>向联调局告密  绝对是死路一条
<7-30,BECKETT>And talking to the FBI is definitely a capital offense.

257
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,910
<7-30,BECKETT>我们还得和冯·洛克谈谈
<7-30,BECKETT>We need to talk to Finn Rourke again.

258
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,540
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>两天前  天使驾临杰克的家中
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>An angel visited Jacky's home two nights ago.

259
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,380
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>就是带走法老长子的那位天使
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>Same angel as took the pharaoh's firstborn.

260
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,930
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>我知道  你们当中有人不知道死亡天使
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>Now I know some of you think you don't know the angel of death.

261
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,770
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>但是相信我  他认识你们
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>But trust me, lads. He knows you.

262
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,530
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>所以
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>So...

263
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,980
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>敬亲爱的杰克
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>Here's to darlin' Jacky.

264
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,740
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>敬杰克
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>To Jay.

265
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,110
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>如果他现在魂在天堂
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>Huh? If he's up in heaven now,

266
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,640
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>肯定是趁天上魂灵做晚祷
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>You can be sure he broke in

267
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,020
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>才进去的
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>when they was at Vespers.

268
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,050
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>我希望你们是来悼念死者的
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>Come to honor the dead I hope.

269
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,930
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>若不是  我将感谢你们离开这里
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>If not, I'll thank you to move away out of this place.

270
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,260
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>你撒谎
<8-1,FINN ROURKE>You're lying.

271
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,690
<8-2,BECKETT>你很清楚杰克·库南是怎么死的
<8-2,BECKETT>You know exactly what happened to Jack Coonan.

272
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,120
<8-2,BECKETT>匆匆审了朱雀
<8-2,BECKETT>That once-over that you gave Trucho

273
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,770
<8-2,BECKETT>只为做戏脱身
<8-2,BECKETT>was just a piece of theater to throw them all off,

274
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,410
<8-2,BECKETT>你的悼词也不过是做戏
<8-2,BECKETT>just like your eulogy.

275
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,690
<8-3,ROURKE>小心你的措辞  探长
<8-3,ROURKE>Now you be careful, Detective.

276
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,170
<8-4,BECKETT>不然呢  杀了我吗  就像杀库南那样
<8-4,BECKETT>Or else what? You'll kill me just like you killed Coonan

277
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,920
<8-4,BECKETT>他一向联调局告发你  就杀了他
<8-4,BECKETT>after he went to the feds about you?

278
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,020
<8-4,BECKETT>够了
<8-4,BECKETT>Enough.

279
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,540
<8-5,ROURKE>不准你诬蔑他
<8-5,ROURKE>I'll not have you slander him like this.

280
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,840
<8-5,ROURKE>今晚不准
<8-5,ROURKE>Not tonight.

281
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,070
<8-6,BECKETT>这是联调局告诉我的
<8-6,BECKETT>I got it straight from the FBI.

282
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,460
<8-6,BECKETT>杰克刚联络联邦探员  就被杀害
<8-6,BECKETT>Jack reached out to them just before he died.

283
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,030
<8-7,CASTLE>他告发你  是吗
<8-7,CASTLE>He turned on you, didn't he?

284
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,150
<8-8,ROURKE>你可别瞎说  小子
<8-8,ROURKE>You don't know what you're talking about, boy-o.

285
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,180
<8-8,ROURKE>杰克·库南一直到死  都是忠心耿耿
<8-8,ROURKE>Jacky Coonan was loyal to his last breath.

286
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,920
<8-8,ROURKE>他临终时蒙受神恩
<8-8,ROURKE>He died in a state of grace.

287
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,640
<8-8,ROURKE>就算你说的是真的
<8-8,ROURKE>Even if what you say is true,

288
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,600
<8-8,ROURKE>可以肯定的是杰克没有出卖我们
<8-8,ROURKE>you can be sure Jacky wasn't talking to the g's about any of us.

289
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,250
<8-9,BECKETT>你如何肯定
<8-9,BECKETT>How can you be so sure?

290
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,560
<8-10,ROURKE>你听过我的大名
<8-10,ROURKE>You've heard of me.

291
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,490
<8-10,ROURKE>知道我是歹徒  是盗贼
<8-10,ROURKE>You've heard I'm a gangster and a thief.

292
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,450
<8-10,ROURKE>可以肯定
<8-10,ROURKE>Surely...

293
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,410
<8-10,ROURKE>你知道  我杀过人
<8-10,ROURKE>You've heard I've killed men.

294
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,140
<8-10,ROURKE>回答我  探长
<8-10,ROURKE>But you answer me this, Detective.

295
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,670
<8-10,ROURKE>你听说过冯·洛克贩卖毒品吗
<8-10,ROURKE>Have you ever heard of Finn Rourke running drugs?

296
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,890
<8-10,ROURKE>有人栽赃陷害我
<8-10,ROURKE>Someone was bringing it in here,

297
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,100
<8-10,ROURKE>在我的地盘  我的后院  出售毒品
<8-10,ROURKE>into my neighborhood, my backyard.

298
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,800
<8-10,ROURKE>我派杰克去调查幕后的狗杂种
<8-10,ROURKE>I sent Jacky to find the bastards behind it--

299
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,850
<8-10,ROURKE>揪出他们  再依据我们的规矩
<8-10,ROURKE>find them and punish them...

300
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,490
<8-10,ROURKE>惩罚他们
<8-10,ROURKE>According to our rules.

301
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,460
<8-11,CASTLE>但最终是他们惩罚了杰克
<8-11,CASTLE>Only they punished him instead.

302
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,960
<8-12,ROURKE>没错
<8-12,ROURKE>Aye.

303
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,960
<8-12,ROURKE>就是他们干的
<8-12,ROURKE>That they did.

304
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,330
<8-12,ROURKE>现在
<8-12,ROURKE>Now...

305
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,690
<8-12,ROURKE>如果你们有正当理由  可以逮捕我
<8-12,ROURKE>If you have probable cause I suggest you arrest me now.

306
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,890
<8-12,ROURKE>若没有  我提醒你们  这是私人派对
<8-12,ROURKE>If not, I'll remind you, this is a private party.

307
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,890
<8-12,ROURKE>我多谢你们  请滚出我的地盘
<8-12,ROURKE>And I'll thank you to get the hell out of my place!

308
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,040
<8-12,ROURKE>再来一杯
<8-12,ROURKE>Another.

309
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,910
<9-1,BECKETT>等等  卡塞尔  她不能直接跟出来
<9-1,BECKETT>Give her a minute, Castle. She can't just follow us out.

310
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,420
<9-1,BECKETT>-这太惹眼了  -你也注意到她了
<9-1,BECKETT>- It would be too obvious.  - You noticed her?

311
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,900
<9-3,BECKETT>我好歹是凶案组探长
<9-3,BECKETT>I'm a Homicide Detective.

312
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,090
<9-3,BECKETT>如果我只会一件事
<9-3,BECKETT>If there's one thing I know how to spot,

313
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,020
<9-3,BECKETT>那就是  那个女人有话要说
<9-3,BECKETT>it's a lady looking to unburden herself.

314
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,230
<9-4,CASTLE>她在找我们
<9-4,CASTLE>She's looking for us.

315
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,400
<9-5,BECKETT>别按喇叭  低点声  你会吓跑她的
<9-5,BECKETT>No, no, no. Don't honk, deep throat. You'll spook her.

316
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,060
<9-6,MOLLY DEARING>你好  我是莫利
<9-6,MOLLY DEARING>Hi, I'm Molly.

317
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,330
<9-7,BECKETT>你好  莫利  我是凯特
<9-7,BECKETT>Hi, Molly. I'm Kate.

318
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,360
<9-7,BECKETT>需要载你到哪里
<9-7,BECKETT>Can we maybe give you a lift somewhere?

319
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,740
<9-8,MOLLY>只要离开这儿就行
<9-8,MOLLY>Anywhere but here.

320
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,930
<10-1,MOLLY>我当然很清楚杰克的背景
<10-1,MOLLY>Of course I knew Jack's reputation.

321
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,530
<10-1,MOLLY>这也是他吸引我的地方
<10-1,MOLLY>It's part of what attracted me to him.

322
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,030
<10-1,MOLLY>怎么了
<10-1,MOLLY>What?

323
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,710
<10-1,MOLLY>凯特  你想说你没爱上过坏男人吗
<10-1,MOLLY>You telling me you never had a thing for bad boys, Kate?

324
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,310
<10-2,BECKETT>无可奉告
<10-2,BECKETT>No comment.

325
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,520
<10-3,CASTLE>杰克没提过去联调局的事吗
<10-3,CASTLE>So Jack never mentioned going to the FBI?

326
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,540
<10-4,MOLLY>杰克从不和我谈这些事
<10-4,MOLLY>Jack never discussed business.

327
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,320
<10-4,MOLLY>但我知道他想退出
<10-4,MOLLY>But I knew he wanted out.

328
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,040
<10-4,MOLLY>我们谈过  要远走高飞
<10-4,MOLLY>We talked about... going somewhere far away.

329
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,840
<10-4,MOLLY>上周杰克告诫我  他可能会先走一步
<10-4,MOLLY>Last week, Jack warned me he might get there first.

330
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,460
<10-5,CASTLE>杰克预料到会这样
<10-5,CASTLE>Jack saw this coming?

331
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,180
<10-6,MOLLY>我们每晚都在一起
<10-6,MOLLY>We spent every night together.

332
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,990
<10-6,MOLLY>没有我睡在他身边  他会失眠的
<10-6,MOLLY>He couldn't get to sleep without me next to him.

333
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,530
<10-6,MOLLY>但上周  他却不让我过去
<10-6,MOLLY>But last week, he wouldn't even let me come over.

334
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,800
<10-6,MOLLY>只有杰克
<10-6,MOLLY>Anybody but Jack.

335
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,150
<10-6,MOLLY>我应该想到他在秘密计划着什么
<10-6,MOLLY>And I'd have thought he had something going on the side.

336
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,010
<10-7,BECKETT>你从没想过吗
<10-7,BECKETT>That never crossed your mind?

337
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,110
<10-8,MOLLY>这是我和杰克相处的最后一晚
<10-8,MOLLY>This is the last thing Jack ever gave me,

338
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,700
<10-8,MOLLY>他给我的最后一样东西
<10-8,MOLLY>on the last night I ever spent with him.

339
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,770
<10-8,MOLLY>杰克说  如果事情变糟
<10-8,MOLLY>Jack said if things broke bad,

340
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,980
<10-8,MOLLY>就把这个交给警察
<10-8,MOLLY>he wanted me to give this to the police.

341
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,040
<10-9,CASTLE>你怎么知道这是车站储物柜的钥匙
<10-9,CASTLE>And how do you know it's to a bus locker?

342
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,900
<10-9,CASTLE>这就是车站储物柜的钥匙
<10-9,CASTLE>It's always to a bus locker.

343
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,060
<10-10,BECKETT>运输安全局拆掉了许多
<10-10,BECKETT>T.S.A. Tore most of them out,

344
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,470
<10-10,BECKETT>有些汽车总站是例外
<10-10,BECKETT>but a few terminals still have them,

345
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,460
<10-10,BECKETT>这里是离库南公寓最近的车站
<10-10,BECKETT>and this one is the closest to Coonan's apartment.

346
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,940
<10-11,CASTLE>等等  不  别打开
<10-11,CASTLE>Wait. No, no, no. Wait. Don't do that.

347
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,470
<10-12,BECKETT>怎么了
<10-12,BECKETT>What?

348
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,090
<10-13,CASTLE>一旦你打开  我们就会看到
<10-13,CASTLE>Well, once you on it, then we'll know.

349
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,370
<10-13,CASTLE>可能会是外星人的尸体
<10-13,CASTLE>Could be an alien corpse in there,

350
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,020
<10-13,CASTLE>失落的约柜[藏刻有十诫石板的木柜]
<10-13,CASTLE>arc of the covenant...

351
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,350
<10-13,CASTLE>或是强尼·王的DVD
<10-13,CASTLE>or Johnny Vong DVDs.

352
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,780
<10-14,ESPOSITO>开玩笑吧
<10-14,ESPOSITO>You gotta be kidding me.

353
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,900
<10-14,ESPOSITO>这就是库南想给联调局的
<10-14,ESPOSITO>This is what Coonan wanted to give to the feds?

354
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,920
<10-15,BECKETT>等等
<10-15,BECKETT>Hold on.

355
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,970
<10-15,BECKETT>不是
<10-15,BECKETT>No.

356
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,810
<10-15,BECKETT>这个才是
<10-15,BECKETT>This is.

357
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,740
<10-15,BECKETT>海洛因
<10-15,BECKETT>Heroin.

358
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,640
<10-16,CASTLE>刚才酷毙了
<10-16,CASTLE>That was so cool just now.

359
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,120
<10-16,CASTLE>-你喜欢  -像足《迈阿密风云》
<10-16,CASTLE>- You like that? - Yeah, it was very "Miami Vice."

360
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,550
<11-1,BECKETT>库南不是要向联调局告发同伙
<11-1,BECKETT>Coonan wasn't going to the feds rat out his Westie pals.

361
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,810
<11-1,BECKETT>他是奉冯·洛克之命
<11-1,BECKETT>He was looking to rat out

362
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,270
<11-1,BECKETT>要铲除那个毒贩
<11-1,BECKETT>the drug dealer Finn Rourke sent him to find.

363
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,950
<11-2,ESPOSITO>可惜毒贩换了脚本
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Only the dealer flips the script.

364
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,980
<11-2,ESPOSITO>在库南与联调局成交前  杀了他
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Knifes Coonan before he can close the deal with the feds.

365
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,230
<11-3,BECKETT>所以找到毒贩  就查到凶手
<11-3,BECKETT>So then we find the dealer, and we find the killer.

366
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,080
<11-4,CASTLE>这些包装盒写着DVD是在香港包装的
<11-4,CASTLE>These boxes say the DVDs were packaged in Hong Kong.

367
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,540
<11-4,CASTLE>肯定是在起运前  加了海洛因
<11-4,CASTLE>Someone must be slipping their heroin in before they're shipped.

368
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,870
<11-5,BECKETT>就是说这边的人肯定知道
<11-5,BECKETT>Which means someone on this end had to know

369
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,400
<11-5,BECKETT>哪些盒子装着毒品
<11-5,BECKETT>which boxes contain the drugs.

370
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,450
<11-6,RYAN>这些盒子也装着走向富裕的秘密通道
<11-6,RYAN>And which boxes contain the secret path to financial independence.

371
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,390
<11-6,RYAN>怎么了
<11-6,RYAN>What?

372
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,810
<11-7,BECKETT>肯定是强尼·王组织里的人
<11-7,BECKETT>It had to be someone in Johnny Vong's organization.

373
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,560
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>如果你只是餐厅小工  没关系
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>I don't care if you're a busboy.

374
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,890
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>如果你围着绿围裙
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>I don't care if you wear the green apron

375
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,700
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>给用蓝牙耳机打电话的混蛋
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>and serve fancy coffee to a jerk

376
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,360
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>倒高级咖啡  也没关系
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>talking on his bluetooth.

377
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,820
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>我也曾和你们一样
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>I was like you once.

378
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,850
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>后来  我发现了改变我一生的秘密
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>Then I discovered the one secret that changed my whole life.

379
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,030
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>有人准备好了吗
<11-8,JOHNNY VONG>Who out there is ready?

380
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,000
<11-9,CASTLE>这地方让我想起我的第二次婚礼
<11-9,CASTLE>This place reminds me of my second wedding.

381
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,970
<11-10,VONG>准备好签约  过新生活吗
<11-10,VONG>Who is ready to close escrow on a new life?

382
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,240
<11-10,VONG>勇敢点
<11-10,VONG>Come on!

383
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,910
<11-11,ESPOSITO>别想着也脱掉袜子
<11-11,ESPOSITO>Don't even think about taking them off.

384
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,840
<11-11,ESPOSITO>如果你脱了  我就朝你喷胡椒粉
<11-11,ESPOSITO>If you do, I will pepper spray you.

385
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,540
<11-12,BECKETT>王先生
<11-12,BECKETT>Mr. Vong.

386
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,170
<11-13,VONG>加油
<11-13,VONG>Yeah, you!

387
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,880
<11-14,BECKETT>王先生  纽约警局凯特·贝克特探长
<11-14,BECKETT>Mr. Vong, I'm Detective Kate Beckett with the NYPD.

388
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,710
<11-14,BECKETT>想问你一些问题
<11-14,BECKETT>I'd like to ask you a few questions.

389
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,150
<11-15,VONG>当然可以
<11-15,VONG>Sure, sure, sure.

390
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,610
<11-16,BECKETT>警方认为你有一位员工
<11-16,BECKETT>We believe that one of your employees

391
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,960
<11-16,BECKETT>利用你的供应链  走私海洛因到美国
<11-16,BECKETT>was smuggling heroin into the country using your supply chain.

392
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,950
<11-17,VONG>走私什么
<11-17,VONG>Smuggle what?

393
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,020
<11-18,CASTLE>海洛因
<11-18,CASTLE>Smack.

394
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,050
<11-19,BECKETT>介意我们查看你的
<11-19,BECKETT>Would you mind if we looked into your--

395
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,630
<12-1,BECKETT>买卖海洛因
<12-1,BECKETT>Heroin trafficking--

396
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,840
<12-1,BECKETT>足够坐10年牢
<12-1,BECKETT>That's good for a 10-year prison bid.

397
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
<12-1,BECKETT>我不会责怪你逃跑
<12-1,BECKETT>So I don't blame you for running.

398
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,630
<12-2,VONG>这完全搞错了
<12-2,VONG>This is all a big mistake.

399
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,270
<12-2,VONG>我从不碰毒品
<12-2,VONG>I never do drugs.

400
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,340
<12-2,VONG>毒品是窝囊废干的  我是个正经生意人
<12-2,VONG>Drugs are for losers. I'm a businessman.

401
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,360
<12-2,VONG>我努力帮人们完成他们的目标
<12-2,VONG>I try to help people achieve their goals.

402
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,610
<12-3,CASTLE>除非他们的目标是在你虚假的房地产系统
<12-3,CASTLE>So long as their goals are to blow 300 bucks

403
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,820
<12-3,CASTLE>砸上300美元
<12-3,CASTLE>on your bogus real estate system.

404
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,430
<12-4,VONG>不  我提供30天退款保证
<12-4,VONG>No, listen, I offer you 30-day, money-back guarantee.

405
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,300
<12-4,VONG>如果那时你还没有获利
<12-4,VONG>If you don't start building wealth by then,

406
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,470
<12-4,VONG>我无条件  全额退款
<12-4,VONG>I refund all your money, no questions asked.

407
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,970
<12-4,VONG>骗局会有这种好条件吗
<12-4,VONG>Could I make that offer if this was some kind of scam?

408
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,170
<12-5,RYAN>有道理
<12-5,RYAN>The man has a point.

409
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,590
<12-6,ESPOSITO>闭嘴  你不觉得他
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Shut up. You don't think he--

410
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,860
<12-7,RYAN>不
<12-7,RYAN>No.

411
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,940
<12-8,ESPOSITO>听着  这样  我不是缉毒警察
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Look, here's the deal-- I'm not a dope cop.

412
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,290
<12-8,ESPOSITO>我是凶案组警察
<12-8,ESPOSITO>I'm a Homicide Detective.

413
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,790
<12-9,BECKETT>所以  通常  我不管你做的生意
<12-9,BECKETT>So usually I don't even bother with your sort of an operation.

414
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,140
<12-9,BECKETT>但是我的问题  还有你的
<12-9,BECKETT>But my problem, and yours,

415
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,570
<12-9,BECKETT>是你为了掩盖走私海洛因
<12-9,BECKETT>is the fact that you had Jack Coonan killed

416
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,570
<12-9,BECKETT>就杀了杰克·库南
<12-9,BECKETT>in order to hide your heroin smuggling.

417
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,060
<12-10,VONG>等等  杰克·库南死了
<12-10,VONG>Wait. Jack Coonan's dead?

418
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,840
<12-11,CASTLE>小心点  强尼
<12-11,CASTLE>Whoa. Careful there, Johnny.

419
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,050
<12-11,CASTLE>你的口音开始没那么重了
<12-11,CASTLE>Your accent's starting to fade a little.

420
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,600
<12-12,VONG>听着  我不是偷渡来的
<12-12,VONG>Look, I didn't come over on a boat, okay?

421
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,300
<12-12,VONG>我从未去过老挝  我来自加州的丹维尔
<12-12,VONG>I've never even been to Laos. I'm from Danville, California.

422
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,150
<12-13,CASTLE>那这强尼·王是怎么回事
<12-13,CASTLE>And this whole Johnny Vong thing?

423
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,960
<12-14,VONG>没有人想从哈佛的工商管理硕士那
<12-14,VONG>No one wants to buy a real estate system

424
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,150
<12-14,VONG>买这个投资计划  但若是个
<12-14,VONG>from a Harvard M.B.A., but show them an idiot

425
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,990
<12-14,VONG>开着劳斯莱斯的笨蛋  他们却会买账
<12-14,VONG>with a Rolls-Royce, and they'll knock down doors.

426
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,610
<12-14,VONG>所以我才扮了强尼·王
<12-14,VONG>So I played Johnny Vong.

427
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,800
<12-14,VONG>大家都爱听霍雷肖·阿尔杰式[美国梦倡导者]的废话
<12-14,VONG>You know, people want all that Horatio Alger crap,

428
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,720
<12-14,VONG>我就投其所好喽
<12-14,VONG>So that's what I give 'em.

429
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,900
<12-15,CASTLE>顺便还卖海洛因
<12-15,CASTLE>Well, that and heroin.

430
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
<12-16,BECKETT>你到底对杰克·库南了解多少
<12-16,BECKETT>How exactly did you know Jack Coonan?

431
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,650
<12-17,VONG>听着  不管你自以为掌握了多少情报
<12-17,VONG>Look, whatever you think you know,

432
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,340
<12-17,VONG>我向你保证  我没杀库南
<12-17,VONG>I promise you, I didn't kill Coonan.

433
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,640
<12-17,VONG>你们得相信我
<12-17,VONG>You have to believe me.

434
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,510
<12-18,BECKETT>是吗  你的所有信息都是假的
<12-18,BECKETT>Do I? Nothing about you is real.

435
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,480
<12-18,BECKETT>不是的
<12-18,BECKETT>No.

436
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,960
<12-19,VONG>为了把节目在全国推广  我需要资金
<12-19,VONG>I needed money to take the program national.

437
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,900
<12-19,VONG>而他需要一个渠道把货弄到美国
<12-19,VONG>He needed a way to get product into the country.

438
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,740
<12-19,VONG>虽然很愚蠢  但一旦你和恶魔做了交易
<12-19,VONG>It was stupid, but once you make a deal with the devil,

439
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,790
<12-20,BECKETT>你就要听从他
<12-20,BECKETT>You belong to him.

440
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,120
<12-20,BECKETT>你要听从谁  你在为谁卖命
<12-20,BECKETT>Who do you belong to? Who are you working for?

441
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,350
<12-21,VONG>他会杀了我的
<12-21,VONG>He'll kill me.

442
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,330
<12-22,BECKETT>-我能保护你   -你不能  没人能
<12-22,BECKETT>- I can protect you.  - You can't. Nobody can.

443
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,440
<12-23,VONG>你不知道他有多神通广大
<12-23,VONG>You don't know what he's capable of.

444
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,930
<12-23,VONG>不相信  看杰克·库南就知道了
<12-23,VONG>You don't believe me. Ask Jack Coonan.

445
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,750
<12-24,BECKETT>听着  王先生  我
<12-24,BECKETT>Look, Mr. Vong, I--

446
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,120
<12-25,VONG>算了  我还是选择坐牢
<12-25,VONG>No. I'll take my chances in prison.

447
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,030
<12-25,VONG>我宁愿坐十年牢  也不想没命
<12-25,VONG>I'd rather lose ten years of my life than all of it.

448
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,900
<13-1,BECKETT>得罪他的老板
<13-1,BECKETT>Whoever he's working for

449
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,920
<13-1,BECKETT>比坐牢还糟糕
<13-1,BECKETT>scares him a lot more than prison.

450
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,030
<13-2,CASTLE>肯定有办法能让他开口
<13-2,CASTLE>There has to be a way to get it out of him.

451
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,170
<13-2,CASTLE>我们可以让他看帕里斯·希尔顿的视频
<13-2,CASTLE>We could force him to watch Paris Hilton videos.

452
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,390
<13-3,BECKETT>你想害我被告吗
<13-3,BECKETT>You want me brought up on charges?

453
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,560
<13-4,LANIE>贝克特
<13-4,LANIE>Beckett?

454
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,420
<13-5,BECKETT>蕾妮  你怎么到这儿来了
<13-5,BECKETT>Hey Lanie, what are you doing here?

455
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,730
<13-6,LANIE>是有关库南的案子
<13-6,LANIE>Uh, it's about the Coonan case.

456
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,840
<13-6,LANIE>这是克拉克·默里博士
<13-6,LANIE>This is Dr. Clark Murray.

457
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,750
<13-6,LANIE>是个法医病理学家  我请他来协助鉴定
<13-6,LANIE>He's a forensic pathologist. I asked him to consult.

458
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,230
<13-7,BECKETT>我是  凯特·贝克特探长
<13-7,BECKETT>I'm, uh, Detective Kate Beckett.

459
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,350
<13-7,BECKETT>这位是理查德·卡塞尔  小说家
<13-7,BECKETT>This is Richard Castle, the novelist.

460
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,880
<13-8,CASTLE>我们见过了
<13-8,CASTLE>We've met.

461
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,220
<14-1,DR CLARK MURRAY>看到伤口周围的
<14-1,DR CLARK MURRAY>Note the rectangular bruising

462
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,710
<14-1,DR CLARK MURRAY>矩形瘀伤了吗
<14-1,DR CLARK MURRAY>around these wounds...

463
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,660
<14-1,DR CLARK MURRAY>这里  还有这里
<14-1,DR CLARK MURRAY>Here and here...

464
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,640
<14-3,MURRAY>是用刀柄用力击打
<14-3,MURRAY>Caused by the hilt of the knife striking with force enough

465
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,180
<14-3,MURRAY>挤压皮肤所致
<14-3,MURRAY>to compress the skin.

466
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,700
<14-4,BECKETT>结果就是  伤痕
<14-4,BECKETT>And as a result, the injuries

467
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,580
<14-4,BECKETT>比实际刀身渗透的更深
<14-4,BECKETT>penetrate deeper than the actual length of the blade.

468
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,710
<14-5,MURRAY>他的刀磨得很锋利
<14-5,MURRAY>He's also honed his blade so fine,

469
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,070
<14-5,MURRAY>所以刀碰到骨头时  是很容易断的
<14-5,MURRAY>It's brittle enough for bits to break when it strikes bone,

470
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,320
<14-5,MURRAY>所以在两名死者体内
<14-5,MURRAY>Which is why slivers of blade

471
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
<14-5,MURRAY>都发现刀刃碎片
<14-5,MURRAY>were found inside both of his victims.

472
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,600
<14-5,MURRAY>现在我们已确认这些碎片
<14-5,MURRAY>We now know those slivers

473
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,350
<14-5,MURRAY>属于同一件凶器
<14-5,MURRAY>come from the same murder weapon.

474
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,340
<14-6,BECKETT>等等  两名死者  他杀了多少人
<14-6,BECKETT>Wait, two victims? How many people has he killed?

475
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
<14-7,LANIE>我们知道的有五个
<14-7,LANIE>Five that we know of.

476
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,130
<14-8,BECKETT>那么这是连环杀人案
<14-8,BECKETT>So we're looking at a serial?

477
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,200
<14-9,MURRAY>说对了一半
<14-9,MURRAY>Well, yes and no.

478
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,260
<14-9,MURRAY>我们确定对方是个职业杀手
<14-9,MURRAY>We believe we're dealing with a professional,

479
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,170
<14-9,MURRAY>接受过大量的军事训练
<14-9,MURRAY>someone with extensive military training.

480
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,380
<14-10,BECKETT>是雇佣杀手
<14-10,BECKETT>A contract killer?

481
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,800
<14-11,MURRAY>我对库南的伤口进行了断层重建
<14-11,MURRAY>I used tomographic reconstruction of Coonan's wounds

482
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,590
<14-11,MURRAY>做个凶器的三维模型
<14-11,MURRAY>to generate a 3-D model of the blade used.

483
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,910
<14-11,MURRAY>这是特种作战组织用的刀
<14-11,MURRAY>It's a special operations group knife...

484
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,360
<14-11,MURRAY>尤受第一次海湾战争的特种兵的亲睐
<14-11,MURRAY>The kind favored by special forces in Gulf War one.

485
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,140
<14-11,MURRAY>死者都是一刀毙命
<14-11,MURRAY>He kills with a single blow

486
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,790
<14-11,MURRAY>其他的伤口只为掩饰杀人手法
<14-11,MURRAY>using these other wounds to camouflage the skill

487
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,420
<14-11,MURRAY>这样  第一刀就无从辨别了
<14-11,MURRAY>with which the initial stroke was delivered.

488
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,950
<14-11,MURRAY>和十年前的那个凶手
<14-11,MURRAY>The very same method and the very same weapon

489
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,050
<14-11,MURRAY>所用的手法和凶器  完全相同
<14-11,MURRAY>that the killer employed... ten years ago.

490
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,320
<14-12,BECKETT>蕾妮
<14-12,BECKETT>L-Lanie...

491
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,340
<14-13,LANIE>我很抱歉
<14-13,LANIE>I'm so sorry.

492
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,170
<14-14,MURRAY>贝克特探长
<14-14,MURRAY>Detective Beckett,

493
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,120
<14-14,MURRAY>我敢确定 杀害杰克·库南的凶手
<14-14,MURRAY>there is no doubt in my mind that Jack Coonan was killed

494
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,700
<14-14,MURRAY>和当年杀害你母亲的  是同一个人
<14-14,MURRAY>by the same man who murdered your mother.

495
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,870
<14-15,BECKETT>我是这个案子的负责人
<14-15,BECKETT>I am the investigator of record on this case.

496
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,420
<14-15,BECKETT>你无权对我隐瞒证据
<14-15,BECKETT>You had no right to withhold evidence from me.

497
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,900
<14-16,LANIE>那你想我怎么做
<14-16,LANIE>Well, what did you expect?

498
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,720
<14-16,LANIE>上次卡塞尔试着和你谈
<14-16,LANIE>The last time Castle tried to talk to you

499
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,980
<14-16,LANIE>你母亲的案子时 你差点拧断他的脖子
<14-16,LANIE>about your mother's murder, you bit his head off.

500
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,120
<14-17,BECKETT>别找借口  蕾妮
<14-17,BECKETT>Please, Lanie.

501
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,510
<14-18,LANIE>我注意到了伤口很相似
<14-18,LANIE>I noticed the wound similarity.

502
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,950
<14-18,LANIE>就找默里博士帮忙
<14-18,LANIE>I reached out to Dr. Murray.

503
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,030
<14-18,LANIE>在证据确凿之前
<14-18,LANIE>I held off from telling you

504
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,430
<14-18,LANIE>我是没有告诉你
<14-18,LANIE>until I knew the evidence was rock-solid.

505
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,520
<14-18,LANIE>但贝克特  我们一确定就来找你了
<14-18,LANIE>Beckett, we came to you the moment we were sure.

506
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,440
<14-18,LANIE>贝克特  我能和你谈谈吗
<14-18,LANIE>Beckett. Can I have a word with you?

507
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,010
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>可怜人的止痛药
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>Poor man's painkiller.

508
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,490
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>我知道是因为你母亲被谋杀
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>I know your mother's murder

509
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,210
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>你才来到警队
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>was the reason you become a cop.

510
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,680
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>我也知道你第一次办她的案子时
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>And I know how you almost lost yourself

511
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,800
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>几乎迷失了自我
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>trying to solve her case the first time you tried.

512
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,270
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>但我觉得只要你准备好了  不论迟早
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>I figured sooner or later, when you were ready,

513
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,510
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>你会再次全力追查
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>you'd want to take another run at it.

514
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,000
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>我只是没想到这个凶手会再次犯案
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>I just never expected her killer to come around

515
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>给你这么重的打击
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>and sucker punch you like this.

516
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,110
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>凯特  听我说
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>Kate, listen to me.

517
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,080
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>你是我培养出的
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>You're the finest homicide

518
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,140
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>最优秀的警察  无人可比
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>I've ever trained, bar none.

519
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,440
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>可以的话  我希望你能继续查下去
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>And I want you to stay on this one, if you can.

520
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,180
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>如果你愿意的话
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>If you're up to it.

521
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,680
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>但作为你的长官
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>But I wouldn't be doing my job as your Captain

522
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,260
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>我必须问一句
<14-19,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>if I didn't ask...

523
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,130
<14-20,BECKETT>你能办好这个案子吗
<14-20,BECKETT>Can you handle this?

524
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,780
<14-20,BECKETT>抱歉  长官
<14-20,BECKETT>I'm sorry, sir.

525
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,390
<14-20,BECKETT>我办不到
<14-20,BECKETT>I can't.

527

<14-21,CASTLE>凯特
<14-21,CASTLE>Kate.

528

<15-1,JIM BECKETT>Katie.

529
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,050
<15-2,BECKETT>晚上好  爸爸
<15-2,BECKETT>Hey, dad.

530
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,110
<15-3,JIM>那  你发现什么了呢
<15-3,JIM>So... what have you found?

531
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,990
<15-4,BECKETT>还不知道
<15-4,BECKETT>I don't know yet.

532
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,410
<15-5,JIM>但确实吓坏了你
<15-5,JIM>But enough to scare you.

533
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,460
<15-6,BECKETT>是的
<15-6,BECKETT>Yeah.

534
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,310
<15-7,JIM>你从警校毕业的第一年
<15-7,JIM>I didn't sleep well that whole first year

535
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,140
<15-7,JIM>我没睡过一个踏实觉
<15-7,JIM>after you got out of the Academy.

536
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,720
<15-7,JIM>晚上我一听到警笛声
<15-7,JIM>I'd hear sirens in the night

537
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,150
<15-7,JIM>就会想像你身处于黑暗之中
<15-7,JIM>and imagine you off in the darkness someplace.

538
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,210
<15-7,JIM>我做噩梦  梦到你被黑夜吞噬
<15-7,JIM>I had nightmares where it swallowed you whole.

539
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,860
<15-8,BECKETT>爸爸  我不想错过这个机会
<15-8,BECKETT>Dad, I don't want to lose this one.

540
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,910
<15-9,JIM>你妈妈经常说  生活中
<15-9,JIM>Your mother always said that life...

541
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,740
<15-9,JIM>没有我们面对不了的事
<15-9,JIM>never delivers anything that we can't handle.

542
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,020
<15-9,JIM>她一生都坚信这点
<15-9,JIM>I mean, she lived by that, you know?

543
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,050
<15-9,JIM>这是约翰娜永恒不变的生活法则
<15-9,JIM>Called it Johanna's immutable law of the universe.

544
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,150
<15-9,JIM>有几年  我认为她错了
<15-9,JIM>And for years, I thought she was wrong...

545
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,340
<15-9,JIM>因为我无法面对失去她
<15-9,JIM>because I couldn't handle losing her.

546
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,960
<15-9,JIM>现在
<15-9,JIM>Now...

547
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,200
<15-9,JIM>我几乎能听到她在轻语
<15-9,JIM>I can almost hear her whisper,

548
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,550
<15-9,JIM>我说过的
<15-9,JIM>"I told you so."

549
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,510
<15-10,BECKETT>妈妈最爱的四个字
<15-10,BECKETT>Four of mom's favorite words.

550
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,510
<15-10,BECKETT>听我说
<15-10,BECKETT>Look...

551
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,850
<15-11,JIM>她对真相坚信不疑
<15-11,JIM>She was a devout believer in the truth,

552
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,430
<15-11,JIM>如果她现在在这里
<15-11,JIM>and if she were here right now,

553
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,610
<15-11,JIM>她会告诉你  真相绝对无法伤害你
<15-11,JIM>she'd tell you, the truth can never hurt you.

554
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,850
<15-11,JIM>可能是你妈妈通过这种方式
<15-11,JIM>You know, this may be your mother's way

555
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,970
<15-11,JIM>在帮助你  凯蒂
<15-11,JIM>of reaching out to you, Katie...

556
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,590
<15-11,JIM>她在提醒你  真相
<15-11,JIM>and reminding you that the truth...

557
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,010
<15-11,JIM>仍是你手中的武器
<15-11,JIM>is still your weapon to wield,

558
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,910
<15-11,JIM>而非他们的
<15-11,JIM>not theirs.

574
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,830

<17-1,BECKETT>忘了告诉你你所享有的权利
<17-1,BECKETT>I forgot to read you your Miranda rights.

<17-4,VONG>I'll be dead by morning.

585
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,630
<17-5,BECKETT>对  没错
<17-5,BECKETT>Yes, you will.

586
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,620
<17-5,BECKETT>或者告诉我你在替谁做事
<17-5,BECKETT>Or you can tell me who you're working for,

587
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,280
<17-5,BECKETT>我会保护你
<17-5,BECKETT>and I will protect you.

588
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,830
<17-5,BECKETT>迪克·库南
<17-5,BECKETT>Dick Coonan.

589
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,090
<17-6,VONG>我替迪克做事
<17-6,VONG>I work for Dick.

590
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,700
<17-7,BECKETT>你是说
<17-7,BECKETT>You're telling me

591
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,340
<17-7,BECKETT>杰克·库南的哥哥是个毒贩
<17-7,BECKETT>Jack Coonan's brother is a drug trafficker?

592
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,810
<18-1,VONG>他装的像吉米·卡特[美国第39位总统]
<18-1,VONG>He comes off like Jimmy Carter,

593
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,060
<18-1,VONG>但其实那些都是骗局
<18-1,VONG>but it was all a scam

594
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,230
<18-1,VONG>只为凑钱给种罂粟的军阀
<18-1,VONG>to funnel money to the Warlords with the poppy fields.

595
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,610
<18-1,VONG>没错  他是建了几所学校
<18-1,VONG>Sure, he built a few schools,

596
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,710
<18-1,VONG>以此对捐赠者有个交代
<18-1,VONG>uh, so he had pictures for his donors,

597
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,660
<18-1,VONG>但大部分资金都流入到毒品买卖里了
<18-1,VONG>but, you know, most of the money funded his cartel.

598
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,860
<18-2,BECKETT>所以只要是想要的毒品  他都能搞到
<18-2,BECKETT>So he had access to all the dope he wanted.

599
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,070
<18-2,BECKETT>他只是需要一个渠道把货弄到国内来
<18-2,BECKETT>He just needed a way of getting it into the country.

600
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,850
<18-3,VONG>自911以后  要想神不知鬼不觉地
<18-3,VONG>You couldn't get an aspirin from Kabul to New York

601
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,320
<18-3,VONG>从喀布尔弄粒阿司匹林到纽约  都很难
<18-3,VONG>without somebody knowing about it, not since 9/11.

602
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,880
<18-3,VONG>我要做的
<18-3,VONG>All I had to do

603
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,630
<18-3,VONG>是让他在我香港的工厂里装货
<18-3,VONG>was let him package the drugs at my factory in Hong Kong.

604
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,590
<18-3,VONG>一过海关
<18-3,VONG>He'd pick up the dirty shipments

605
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,760
<18-3,VONG>他就来接货
<18-3,VONG>once they cleared customs.

606
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,720
<18-4,CASTLE>然后再让拉丁之王拿去卖
<18-4,CASTLE>And he had the Latin Kings put it on the street.

607
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,870
<18-5,VONG>天衣无缝
<18-5,VONG>Perfect system.

608
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,370
<18-5,VONG>百密一疏的是  朱雀一时犯傻
<18-5,VONG>Well, perfect until Trucho caught a case of stupid

609
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,330
<18-5,VONG>竟然把毒品拿到西部联盟的地盘卖
<18-5,VONG>and started selling in the Westies' territory.

610
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,550
<18-6,BECKETT>于是他们就派杰克四处查探
<18-6,BECKETT>And then that's what brought Jack sniffing around.

611
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,030
<18-6,BECKETT>杰克威胁他  如果他不收手
<18-6,BECKETT>Jack threatened to give him to the feds

612
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,080
<18-6,BECKETT>就把事捅到联调局
<18-6,BECKETT>unless he quit.

613
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,040
<18-7,CASTLE>-杰克杀了他的亲大哥  -不是
<18-7,CASTLE>- So Dick killed his own brother  - Oh, no.

614
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,820
<18-8,VONG>杰克在西部联盟这么久
<18-8,VONG>Jack had been with the Westies a long time.

615
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,650
<18-8,VONG>他脑袋后面可都长着眼睛
<18-8,VONG>He'd grown eyes in the back of his head.

616
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,650
<18-8,VONG>迪克雇了个职业杀手
<18-8,VONG>Dick hired a professional.

617
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,770
<18-9,BECKETT>叫什么名字
<18-9,BECKETT>What's his name?

618
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,080
<18-10,VONG>他叫他拉斯伯恩
<18-10,VONG>Uh, he called him Rathborne.

619
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,690
<18-11,BECKETT>怎样找他
<18-11,BECKETT>How do I find him?

620
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,130
<18-12,VONG>去问迪克·库南
<18-12,VONG>Ask Dick Coonan.

621
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,520
<19-1,COONAN>案子进展如何
<19-1,COONAN>So... Any, uh, progress

622
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,400
<19-1,COONAN>查出杀害我大哥的凶手了吗
<19-1,COONAN>on the son of a bitch who killed my brother?

623
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,370
<19-2,BECKETT>就快找到了
<19-2,BECKETT>We're close.

624
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,590
<19-2,BECKETT>警方认为杰克被杀是因为
<19-2,BECKETT>We think that Jack was killed after Rourke asked him

625
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,220
<19-2,BECKETT>洛克派他去查一个毒贩
<19-2,BECKETT>to hunt down a drug dealer.

626
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,950
<19-3,CASTLE>看来西部联盟这几年在毒品战上
<19-3,CASTLE>Turns out the Westies have done a pretty good job

627
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,740
<19-3,CASTLE>守卫的是相当严密
<19-3,CASTLE>with the war on drugs these past few years.

628
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,990
<19-3,CASTLE>一点也不容许
<19-3,CASTLE>Talk about zero tolerance.

629
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,180
<19-3,CASTLE>在他们的地盘兜售毒品
<19-3,CASTLE>The punishment for dealing drugs in their neighborhood

630
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,810
<19-3,CASTLE>死路一条
<19-3,CASTLE>is death.

631
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,310
<19-4,BECKETT>但当他查探到那个毒贩
<19-4,BECKETT>But when he tracked down this dealer,

632
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,060
<19-4,BECKETT>因为某种原因  杰克没有狠心杀了他
<19-4,BECKETT>for some reason, Jack didn't have the heart to kill him.

633
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,690
<19-5,COONAN>典型的杰克式做法
<19-5,COONAN>That is so Jacky.

634
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,790
<19-5,COONAN>他总是冒冒失失
<19-5,COONAN>He always led with his chin.

635
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,930
<19-5,COONAN>好像他这一生  都在期盼着
<19-5,COONAN>He went through life like he was expecting to

636
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,480
<19-5,COONAN>能获得最佳运动员奖
<19-5,COONAN>win the good sportsman award on trophy night.

637
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,010
<19-6,BECKETT>少废话  库南
<19-6,BECKETT>Cut the crap, Coonan.

638
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,160
<19-6,BECKETT>对你的毒品金三角  我们一清二楚
<19-6,BECKETT>We know all about your heroin triangle--

639
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,770
<19-6,BECKETT>阿富汗  香港
<19-6,BECKETT>Afghanistan, Hong Kong...

640
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,550
<19-6,BECKETT>纽约
<19-6,BECKETT>New York.

641
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,800
<19-6,BECKETT>我们还知道  你雇了杀手
<19-6,BECKETT>And we also know that you hired an assassin

642
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
<19-6,BECKETT>名叫拉斯伯恩
<19-6,BECKETT>named Rathborne

643
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,760
<19-6,BECKETT>你命他在你哥哥向联调局告密前
<19-6,BECKETT>to kill your brother before he went to

644
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
<19-6,BECKETT>将他灭口
<19-6,BECKETT>the feds about you.

645
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,010
<19-7,COONAN>拿出证据来
<19-7,COONAN>Prove it.

646
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,340
<20-1,CASTLE>你还好吗
<20-1,CASTLE>Are you okay?

647
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,060
<20-2,BECKETT>已经十年了  那天我们回到家
<20-2,BECKETT>Ten years since we came home

648
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,850
<20-2,BECKETT>发现有位警察在等我们
<20-2,BECKETT>and found that Detective waiting for us.

649
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,390
<20-2,BECKETT>我和父亲跨过警戒线  走进那条小巷
<20-2,BECKETT>Ten years since we crossed that yellow tape

650
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,670
<20-2,BECKETT>已经十年了
<20-2,BECKETT>and went into that alley.

651
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,350
<20-2,BECKETT>每次走过犯罪现场的警戒线
<20-2,BECKETT>And every time I cross the tape at a crime scene,

652
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,150
<20-2,BECKETT>我都会想起那晚
<20-2,BECKETT>I think of that night.

653
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,880
<20-3,CASTLE>也正因为这样你才成为了一名好警察
<20-3,CASTLE>That's what makes you such a good cop.

654
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,020
<20-4,BECKETT>如果我让母亲失望了呢
<20-4,BECKETT>What if I let her down?

655
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,570
<20-5,CASTLE>你知道为什么我选择你
<20-5,CASTLE>Do you know why I chose you

656
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,680
<20-5,CASTLE>作为妮基·希特的创作原型
<20-5,CASTLE>as my inspiration for Nikki Heat?

657
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,550
<20-6,BECKETT>不知道  为什么
<20-6,BECKETT>No. Why?

658
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,580
<20-7,CASTLE>因为你个子高
<20-7,CASTLE>Because you're tall.

659
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,650
<20-7,CASTLE>现在进去吧  做好你的工作
<20-7,CASTLE>Now go in there and do your job.

660
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,970
<20-7,CASTLE>司法会计正在
<20-7,CASTLE>I have forensic accountants

661
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,770
<21-1,BECKETT>审查你的公司  库南先生
<21-1,BECKETT>digging through your organization, Mr. Coonan.

662
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,870
<21-1,BECKETT>只要有买卖海洛因的蛛丝马迹
<21-1,BECKETT>If there's evidence of heroin trafficking,

663
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,740
<21-1,BECKETT>他们就会找到
<21-1,BECKETT>they will find it.

664
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,280
<21-1,BECKETT>但现在这还不是你最大的问题
<21-1,BECKETT>But that's not your biggest problem right now.

665
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,150
<21-1,BECKETT>雇用拉斯伯恩这样的杀手
<21-1,BECKETT>Hiring an assassin like Rathborne

666
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,220
<21-1,BECKETT>表明你是有预谋的
<21-1,BECKETT>shows premeditation,

667
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,780
<21-1,BECKETT>也使现在的情形显得很特殊
<21-1,BECKETT>and that makes this a special circumstance case.

668
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,520
<21-1,BECKETT>注射死亡你都有资格排上
<21-1,BECKETT>Which qualifies you for the needle.

669
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,290
<21-1,BECKETT>现在我可以把这个
<21-1,BECKETT>Now I am willing to take

670
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,760
<21-1,BECKETT>特殊情形暂摆一边
<21-1,BECKETT>the special circumstance allegations off the table

671
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,830
<21-1,BECKETT>只要你供出拉斯伯恩
<21-1,BECKETT>if you give me Rathborne.

672
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,260
<21-2,COONAN>现在唯一特殊的情形  探长
<21-2,COONAN>The only special circumstance here, Detective,

673
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,730
<21-2,COONAN>就是你找不到足够的证据起诉我
<21-2,COONAN>is your complete lack of evidence against me.

674
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,600
<21-3,BECKETT>我有强尼·王做证人
<21-3,BECKETT>I have Johnny Vong.

675
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,870
<21-4,COONAN>那个假装有口音  搞房地产骗局的家伙吗
<21-4,COONAN>The guy with the phony accent and the real estate scam?

676
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,690
<21-4,COONAN>这就是你最拿得出手的证据吗
<21-4,COONAN>Is that the best you can do?

677
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,650
<21-5,BECKETT>你真情愿拿自己的性命赌
<21-5,BECKETT>Are you really willing to bet your life

678
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,940
<21-5,BECKETT>强尼的守口如瓶吗  库南先生
<21-5,BECKETT>that Vong can't hold his mud, Mr. Coonan?

679
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,020
<21-5,BECKETT>交出杀手  我会跟检查官求情
<21-5,BECKETT>Give me the killer, and I will put the D.A. in the mood

680
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,000
<21-5,BECKETT>对你只提出二级起诉
<21-5,BECKETT>for a second-degree plea.

681
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,120
<21-6,COONAN>我们初次见面时
<21-6,COONAN>When we first met,

682
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,890
<21-6,COONAN>你告诉我  你也有类似的经历
<21-6,COONAN>you told me you'd been on the other side of this.

683
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,900
<21-6,COONAN>还记得吗
<21-6,COONAN>Remember?

684
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,370
<21-6,COONAN>那么这个是不是你现在急于
<21-6,COONAN>Now... could that be why you seem so eager

685
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,940
<21-6,COONAN>想抓到这个神秘杀手的原因
<21-6,COONAN>to get your hands on this myterious assassin?

686
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,070
<21-6,COONAN>因为我不得不这样猜想
<21-6,COONAN>Because if I had to guess,

687
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,240
<21-6,COONAN>你的亲人被谋杀了
<21-6,COONAN>I'd say that someone close to you was murdered,

688
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,690
<21-6,COONAN>你觉得拉斯伯恩就是那个凶手
<21-6,COONAN>and you think Rathborne had something to do with it.

689
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,440
<21-6,COONAN>看来我连猜想都不必了
<21-6,COONAN>But I don't have to guess, do I?

690
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,530
<21-6,COONAN>因为你的表情说明了一切
<21-6,COONAN>Because it's all over your face.

691
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,120
<21-7,BECKETT>这并不会改变你的谋杀罪名成立
<21-7,BECKETT>That still doesn't change the fact that you're guilty of murder.

692
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,120
<21-8,COONAN>也许会改变
<21-8,COONAN>Maybe not.

693
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,250
<21-8,COONAN>我为罪行豁免权付出的小小代价就是
<21-8,COONAN>But for the low, low price of transactional immunity,

694
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,450
<21-8,COONAN>我给你想要的答案
<21-8,COONAN>I can give you the closure you've been seeking.

695
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,780
<21-8,COONAN>拉斯伯恩交给你  我被释放
<21-8,COONAN>You get Rathborne, and I walk.

696
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,490
<21-8,COONAN>探长  这是我给你的最后机会
<21-8,COONAN>And that, Detective, is my final offer.

698
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,200
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>我倾向于同意
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>and I'm inclined to give it to him.

699
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,840
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>据我们现在所知  拉斯伯恩已经杀了五个人
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>Rathborne has killed five that we know of,

700
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,020
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>其中一名还是我手下的母亲
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>including the mother of one of my people.

701
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,590
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>这可关系到我们的自己人  保罗
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>It's one of our own, Paul.

702
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,900
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>我记得以前这对市里来说是重要的
<22-1,MONTGOMERY>I remember that used to mean something in this town.

703
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,870
<22-2,CASTLE>怎么样
<22-2,CASTLE>Well?

704
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,990
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>他同意了  地方检查官
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>He went for it. The district attorney

705
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,160
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>将给库南豁免权  只要他交出拉斯伯恩
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>is gonna offer Coonan immunity if he gives us Rathborne.

706
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,960
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>我希望你明白自己到底在做什么
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>I hope you know what the hell you're doing.

707
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,830
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>描述一下他什么样子
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>Describe him.

708
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,010
<23-1,BECKETT>和我差不多高
<23-1,BECKETT>About my height.

709
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,560
<23-2,COONAN>看上去很普通  一点也不出众
<23-2,COONAN>Just so average, he's almost invisible.

710
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,890
<23-3,BECKETT>你们是怎么认识的
<23-3,BECKETT>How did you meet?

711
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,200
<23-4,COONAN>我们一起服过兵役
<23-4,COONAN>We were in the service together.

712
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,340
<23-4,COONAN>大家都说他
<23-4,COONAN>They said he'd been killed

713
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,420
<23-4,COONAN>在95年的训练演习中死了
<23-4,COONAN>back in a training exercise in '95.

714
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,820
<23-4,COONAN>但是大约一年前  我在一家酒吧
<23-4,COONAN>But then about a year ago, I'm sitting at a bar

715
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,940
<23-4,COONAN>一眼望过去  就看到了他这个鬼魂
<23-4,COONAN>and I glance across, and I'm looking at a ghost.

716
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,550
<23-4,COONAN>原来那时他没死  是被招募了
<23-4,COONAN>Turns out he'd actually been recruited back then, not killed,

717
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,910
<23-4,COONAN>去做一些
<23-4,COONAN>to do...

718
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,340
<23-4,COONAN>政府不愿意出面承认的勾当
<23-4,COONAN>Well, the bad stuff that governments like to deny.

719
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,510
<23-5,BECKETT>你是怎样雇用他的
<23-5,BECKETT>How'd you hire him?

720
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,440
<23-6,COONAN>他给了我电话号码
<23-6,COONAN>He'd given me the number

721
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,320
<23-6,COONAN>那是他在开曼群岛的代接电话
<23-6,COONAN>to his answering service in the Caymans.

722
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,090
<23-6,COONAN>然后他们给了我一个
<23-6,COONAN>And then they provided me

723
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,810
<23-6,COONAN>一次性的邮件地址
<23-6,COONAN>with a single-use e-mail address,

724
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,210
<23-6,COONAN>还有账号
<23-6,COONAN>a numbered account.

725
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,720
<23-6,COONAN>我发邮件告诉他们目标的姓名
<23-6,COONAN>E-mailed him the name of his target,

726
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,910
<23-6,COONAN>电汇  然后等着就行了
<23-6,COONAN>wired him the money and waited.

727
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,800
<23-6,COONAN>好的  现在这样做
<23-6,COONAN>Okay, here's the deal--

728
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,710
<23-7,BECKETT>你联系拉斯伯恩  刺杀目标是王
<23-7,BECKETT>You're gonna contact Rathborne with a contract on Vong.

729
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,430
<23-7,BECKETT>你告诉他警方会押解王
<23-7,BECKETT>You're gonna tell him that the police are taking him

730
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,950
<23-7,BECKETT>去地方检查官的办公室提供证词
<23-7,BECKETT>to the D.A.'s office for a deposition,

731
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,280
<23-7,BECKETT>他的任务就是不留活口
<23-7,BECKETT>that he can't make it there alive.

732
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,480
<23-8,COONAN>不是这样操作的
<23-8,COONAN>It doesn't work like that.

733
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,350
<23-8,COONAN>先付钱他才会下手  10万美金  没得商量
<23-8,COONAN>He wants his money up front. It's 100 grand, nonnegotiable.

734
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,300
<23-9,BECKETT>10万  这点上头可没办法同意
<23-9,BECKETT>100 grand? The city is never gonna agree to that.

735
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,960
<23-10,COONAN>如果你要抓住杀害她的凶手
<23-10,COONAN>Look, you want to catch her killer,

736
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,690
<23-10,COONAN>代价就是10万
<23-10,COONAN>the price is 100 grand.

737
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,020
<23-11,BECKETT>我可不能把这么多钱扔到
<23-11,BECKETT>I can't just shoot that kind of money out into space

738
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,660
<23-11,BECKETT>可能收不回来的无底洞
<23-11,BECKETT>without any hope of getting it back.

739
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,040
<23-12,CASTLE>你不能  我可以  这笔钱算我的
<23-12,CASTLE>You can't. I can. This one's on me.

740
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,740
<23-13,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  -就这么说定了
<23-13,BECKETT>- Castle! - Do we have a deal?

741
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,580
<23-14,CASTLE>好
<23-14,CASTLE>We do...

742
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,650
<23-14,CASTLE>我客户的豁免权
<23-14,CASTLE>but my client's immunity kicks in

743
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,790
<23-14,CASTLE>从拉斯伯恩接受刺杀任务那一刻生效
<23-14,CASTLE>the moment Rathborne accepts the contract,

744
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,490
<23-15,BECKETT>只要电汇一完成就行
<23-15,BECKETT>once the wire transfer is complete.

745
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,390
<23-15,BECKETT>只要拉斯伯恩接下这笔生意
<23-15,BECKETT>As soon as Rathborne takes the job,

746
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,160
<23-15,BECKETT>就没你什么事了
<23-15,BECKETT>your part is done.

747
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,490
<23-17,BECKETT>-我就可以走了吗  -你可以走了
<23-17,BECKETT>- And I walk? - And you walk.

748
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,210
<24-1,BECKETT>拉斯伯恩已经上钩了
<24-1,BECKETT>Rathborne has taken the bait.

749
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,740
<24-1,BECKETT>今天的任务中  强尼·王
<24-1,BECKETT>Now for today's performance, the role of Johnny Vong

750
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,790
<24-1,BECKETT>将由警官克莱顿·李扮演
<24-1,BECKETT>will be played by officer Clayton Lee.

<24-3,BECKETT>Ryan and Esposito will escort Lee to the D.A.'s office

753
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,690
<24-3,BECKETT>所经过的路程都是安排好的
<24-3,BECKETT>via a prearranged route.

754
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,390
<24-3,BECKETT>每个街角和道路中段都有便衣
<24-3,BECKETT>We'll have plainclothes in place on every corner and mid-block,

755
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,100
<24-3,BECKETT>还会有空警支援
<24-3,BECKETT>and there'll also be air support,

756
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,150
<24-4,ESPOSITO>-物尽其用  -机会不多
<24-4,ESPOSITO>- for what it's worth. - Not a whole lot.

757
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,920
<24-5,CASTLE>没人知道拉斯伯恩长什么样
<24-5,CASTLE>No one even know what Rathborne looks like.

758
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,330
<24-6,LEE>锁定目标应该不会太难
<24-6,LEE>He shouldn't be too hard to spot.

759
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,010
<24-7,RYAN>是的  他就是那个想干掉你的人
<24-7,RYAN>Yeah, he'll be the one who's trying to kill you.

760
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,510
<24-8,LEE>我们出发吧
<24-8,LEE>All right, let's go, everybody.

<24-9,ESPOSITO>请注意  我们向南往拉斐特街
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Be advised, we are southbound Lafayette

762
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,820
<24-9,ESPOSITO>向渥什街靠近

<24-10,BECKETT>Let me know when you clear the intersection.

765
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,210
<24-11,ESPOSITO>通过交叉路口
<24-11,ESPOSITO>We're through the intersection.

766

<24-11,ESPOSITO>渥什街继续向东行
<24-11,ESPOSITO>Continuing eastbound Worth.

767
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,390
<24-12,CASTLE>计划很周详的
<24-12,CASTLE>It's a solid plan.

768
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,110
<24-13,ESPOSITO>我们进入了停车场
<24-13,ESPOSITO>We're entering the parking garage.

769
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:43,440
<24-14,RYAN>要注意了
<24-14,RYAN>Eyes out.

770
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,230
<24-14,RYAN>这个家伙似乎喜欢近距离下手
<24-14,RYAN>This guy's supposed to like close-up work.

771
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,300
<24-14,RYAN>请注意  我们已经下车了
<24-14,RYAN>Be advised. We are now on foot.

772
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,050
<24-15,ESPOSITO>拉斯伯恩行动了
<24-15,ESPOSITO>Rathborne's making his move.

773
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,010
<24-15,ESPOSITO>趴下
<24-15,ESPOSITO>On the ground!

774
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,490
<24-16,RYAN>扔下枪  不准动
<24-16,RYAN>Drop it! Drop it! Don't move!

775
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,660
<24-18,NOT RATHBORNE>你们发什么神经
<24-18,NOT RATHBORNE>What the hell's wrong with you?

776
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,140
<24-19,ESPOSITO>只是手机
<24-19,ESPOSITO>It's a phone.

777
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,600
<24-20,RYAN>解除警报  不是他
<24-20,RYAN>Disregard. Disregard. It's not him.

778
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,830
<24-20,RYAN>我们打草惊蛇了  拉斯伯恩没有出现
<24-20,RYAN>We must have spooked him. Rathborne didn't show.

779
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,470
<24-21,BECKETT>我还是让母亲失望了
<24-21,BECKETT>I let her down.

780
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,460
<24-22,CASTLE>不  你没有
<24-22,CASTLE>No, you didn't.

781
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,950
<24-23,BECKETT>拉斯伯恩影儿都没见
<24-23,BECKETT>Rathborne's in the wind.

782
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,470
<24-23,BECKETT>迪克·库南马上要被释放
<24-23,BECKETT>Dick Coonan's about to walk.

783
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,530
<24-23,BECKETT>有些地方肯定疏忽了
<24-23,BECKETT>I missed something.

784
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,430
<24-24,CASTLE>也许是我疏忽了
<24-24,CASTLE>Could've been me.

785
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,300
<24-24,CASTLE>拉斯伯恩可能追查了账号
<24-24,CASTLE>Rathborne could've checked the routing number,

786
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,850
<24-24,CASTLE>发现钱是我汇的  而不是迪克
<24-24,CASTLE>realized the money was coming from my account, not Dick's.

787
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,290
<24-24,CASTLE>我真是太自大了
<24-24,CASTLE>I was arrogant.

788
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,680
<24-25,BECKETT>我可不这么想  卡塞尔
<24-25,BECKETT>I didn't think you were arrogant, Castle.

789
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,490
<24-25,BECKETT>我觉得你做得实在是太体贴了
<24-25,BECKETT>I thought what you did was sweet.

790
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,950
<24-25,BECKETT>-我会把钱还你的  -不用了  幽灵骑士
<24-25,BECKETT>- And I will pay you back as - Negative, ghostrider.

791
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,920
<24-26,CASTLE>这只是为了抓住
<24-26,CASTLE>Small price to pay

792
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,710
<24-26,CASTLE>谋害你母亲凶手的小小代价
<24-26,CASTLE>for a shot at your mother's killer.

793
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,830
<24-27,BECKETT>杀害她的凶手
<24-27,BECKETT>Her killer?

794
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,500
<24-28,CASTLE>什么
<24-28,CASTLE>What?

795
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,500
<24-29,BECKETT>库南说需要10万抓住杀害她的凶手
<24-29,BECKETT>Coonan said it was 100 grand to catch her killer.

796
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,360
<24-30,CASTLE>但是你从没跟他说被杀的是你母亲
<24-30,CASTLE>And you never told him it was your mother that was murdered.

797
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,820
<24-31,BECKETT>从来就没有拉斯伯恩  你编了一个来脱身
<24-31,BECKETT>There was no Rathborne. That was just a cover.

798
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,380
<24-31,BECKETT>杀手就是你
<24-31,BECKETT>It was you.

799
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,960
<24-32,COONAN>真是聪明啊
<24-32,COONAN>Clever girl.

800
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,120
<24-32,COONAN>好啦
<24-32,COONAN>All right.

801
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,260
<24-33,BECKETT>现在听我的
<24-33,BECKETT>Now here's what's gonna happen.

802
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,390
<24-33,BECKETT>我们一起慢慢走到电梯那里
<24-33,BECKETT>We're just gonna stroll on over to the elevator together,

803
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,040
<24-33,BECKETT>很简单的
<24-33,BECKETT>nice and easy.

804
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,610
<24-33,BECKETT>你不会得逞的
<24-33,BECKETT>That'll never happen.

805
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,390
<24-34,COONAN>你出声或是打个暗号
<24-34,COONAN>You make a sound, you attempt a signal,

806
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,650
<24-34,COONAN>只要是清清喉咙
<24-34,COONAN>you so much as clear your throat,

807
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,670
<24-34,COONAN>我就对着他的肝来一下
<24-34,COONAN>and I'll put a round in this man's liver.

808
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,420
<24-34,COONAN>他会在剧痛中慢慢死去
<24-34,COONAN>And he will die slowly and in considerable pain.

809
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,790
<24-35,CASTLE>我们走吧
<24-35,CASTLE>Let's go.

810
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,580
<24-36,COONAN>现在观众没有言简意赅的话要说吗
<24-36,COONAN>What, no pithy remarks from the peanut gallery?

811
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,520
<24-36,COONAN>作家亲自面对死亡没什么好玩的吧
<24-36,COONAN>Not so funny facing your own death, is it?

812
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,670
<24-37,CASTLE>我不知道  迪克  不如你告诉我吧
<24-37,CASTLE>I don't know, Dick. You tell me.

813
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,940
<24-37,CASTLE>据我所知  这里可是警察局
<24-37,CASTLE>Last time I checked, this was a police station.

814
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,960
<24-38,BECKETT>我抓你之前  你就知道了  对吗
<24-38,BECKETT>You knew before I arrested you, didn't you?

815
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,860
<24-38,BECKETT>你知道我母亲是被你杀的
<24-38,BECKETT>You knew my mom was your victim.

816
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,880
<24-39,COONAN>不涉及个人问题  只不过是活儿
<24-39,COONAN>It wasn't personal, okay? She was just another job.

817
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,880
<24-40,BECKETT>她可是我的母亲  谁雇你杀她的
<24-40,BECKETT>She was my mother. Who hired you to kill her?

818
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,190
<24-41,COONAN>算了吧  你永远不可能抓到他们
<24-41,COONAN>Forget it. You'll never touch 'em.

819
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,060
<24-42,BECKETT>-他们会先把你给解决了  -告诉我  是谁
<24-42,BECKETT>- They'll bury you. - Tell me who.

820
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,130
<24-42,BECKETT>不要  长官
<24-42,BECKETT>No. No. No! Sir!

821
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,330
<24-43,COONAN>-我需要他活着  -没错  你的确需要
<24-43,COONAN>- I need him alive. - That's right. You do need me.

822
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,420
<24-43,COONAN>让他闪开  否则卡塞尔死定了
<24-43,COONAN>Now back him off, or Castle dies.

823
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,530
<24-44,BECKETT>长官  请退开
<24-44,BECKETT>Sir, back off please.

824
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,770
<24-45,MONTGOMERY>你知道我不能这么做
<24-45,MONTGOMERY>You know I can't do that.

825
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,420
<24-46,COONAN>你想知道谁雇我杀了你老妈
<24-46,COONAN>You want to learn who ordered the hit on your mommy?

826
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,370
<24-46,COONAN>最好让我离开这里
<24-46,COONAN>You better make sure I make it outta here.

827
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,700
<24-47,BECKETT>罗伊  求你了
<24-47,BECKETT>Roy... please.

828
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,970
<24-48,COONAN>这就对了  很简单的
<24-48,COONAN>That's right Roy. Nice and easy.

829
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,550
<24-48,COONAN>这很容易
<24-48,COONAN>Nice and easy.

830
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,850
<24-48,COONAN>别死
<24-48,COONAN>Come on!

831

<24-49,BECKETT>One. Two.Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

836
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,980
<25-1,BECKETT>蒙哥马利写的事件报告
<25-1,BECKETT>Oh. Montgomery's post-incident evaluation.

837
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,840
<25-1,BECKETT>你的表现像极了史蒂文·席格[动作男星]
<25-1,BECKETT>You come off like Steven Seagal.

838
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,100
<25-2,CASTLE>你是恭维我  还是拿我开涮
<25-2,CASTLE>Should I be flattered or insulted?

839
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,450
<25-3,BECKETT>都有
<25-3,BECKETT>Both.

840
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,310
<25-4,CASTLE>我不知道你现在想吃什么
<25-4,CASTLE>I didn't know what you felt like,

841
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:51,040
<25-4,CASTLE>所以我买了寿司
<25-4,CASTLE>so... I got sushi,

842
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,990
<25-4,CASTLE>意大利菜  泰国菜
<25-4,CASTLE>I got some italian, got some thai,

843
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,360
<25-4,CASTLE>还买了些热狗
<25-4,CASTLE>and I grabbed some hot dogs

844
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,180
<25-5,BECKETT>弄成这样不是你的错
<25-5,BECKETT>It wasn't your fault, you know.

845
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,310
<25-6,CASTLE>我拖累你了
<25-6,CASTLE>I overstepped.

846
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,440
<25-6,CASTLE>我来是为了要说对不起
<25-6,CASTLE>I came down here to say that I was sorry

847
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,030
<25-6,CASTLE>然后我就不来了
<25-6,CASTLE>and that I'm through.

848
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,030
<25-6,CASTLE>我不能再跟着你转了  如果不是因为我
<25-6,CASTLE>I can't shadow you anymore. If it wasn't for me--

849
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,020
<25-7,BECKETT>如果不是你  我永远不会
<25-7,BECKETT>If it wasn't for you, I would've never

850
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,010
<25-7,BECKETT>查出杀害我妈妈的凶手
<25-7,BECKETT>found my mom's killer.

851
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,810
<25-7,BECKETT>很快就有这么一天
<25-7,BECKETT>And someday soon,

852
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,400
<25-7,BECKETT>我会抓到那个指使
<25-7,BECKETT>I'm gonna find the sons of bitches

<25-7,BECKETT>当我抓住凶手时  我希望你能看到
<25-7,BECKETT>And I'd like you around when I do.

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,830
<25-7,BECKETT>你的耍花枪我很受用
<25-7,BECKETT>but... I've gotten used to you pulling my pigtails.

858
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,420
<25-7,BECKETT>我的工作不轻松  卡塞尔
<25-7,BECKETT>I have a hard job, Castle,

859
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,640
<25-7,BECKETT>有你在这儿  可以让工作多些乐趣
<25-7,BECKETT>and having you around makes it a little more fun.

860
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,330
