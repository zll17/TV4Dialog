1
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,790
<1-39,ALEXIS>持刀行凶  里克
<1-39,ALEXIS>A stabbing, Rick?

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,750
<1-30,CASTLE>你不觉得平淡乏味吗
<1-30,CASTLE>Isn't that a little pedestrian for you?

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,270
<1-20,CASTLE>通常你来找我
<1-20,CASTLE>Usually when you call me,

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,540
<1-10,MARTHA>问的都是如果把头
<1-10,MARTHA>It's to ask what happens

5
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,040
<1-1,CASTLE>-放进微波炉会怎样  -这次问的可不是虚构的
<1-1,CASTLE>- If you put a head in a microwave. - Well, this one's a little less made-up.

6
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,720
<1-1,CASTLE>死者是我跟的探长的母亲
<1-1,CASTLE>The victim is the mother of the detective I've been following around.

7
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,860
<1-2,CASTLE>这案子十年来一直悬而未决
<1-2,CASTLE>The case has been cold ten years.

8
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,540
<1-2,CASTLE>我只是觉得
<1-2,CASTLE>I just figured,

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,550
<1-2,CASTLE>既然你是本市最棒的法医病理专家
<1-2,CASTLE>Since you're the best forensic pathologist in the city,

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,050
<1-2,CASTLE>也许你能发现什么遗漏的地方
<1-2,CASTLE>Maybe you could catch something they missed.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,870
<1-2,CASTLE>要知道现实不是小说
<1-2,CASTLE>You know reality isn't fiction, right?

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,520
<1-3,CASTLE>你找的可是十年前的凶手
<1-3,CASTLE>The odds of finding anyone's killer after ten years

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,010
<1-3,CASTLE>我知道这有点天方夜谭
<1-3,CASTLE>Astronomical, I know.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,040
<1-3,CASTLE>但如果你愿意帮我看看  我会感激不尽
<1-3,CASTLE>But I'd appreciate it if you took a look.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,430
<1-3,CASTLE>好吧  我尽力
<1-3,CASTLE>Well, I'll do what I can.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,320
<1-4,CASTLE>但是我不保证有结果
<1-4,CASTLE>Just don't go making any promises I can't keep.

17
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,590
<1-4,CASTLE>没问题
<1-4,CASTLE>Of course not.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,430
<1-4,CASTLE>-感谢啦  -我尽快给你答复
<1-4,CASTLE>- Thanks again. - Get back to you as soon as I can.

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,680
<1-5,CASTLE>谢谢
<1-5,CASTLE>I appreciate it.

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,730
<1-6,MARTHA>死神博士来我家干嘛
<1-6,MARTHA>What was Dr. Death doing here?

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,970
<1-7,CASTLE>我有点问题要咨询他
<1-7,CASTLE>Just a little consulting.

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,820
<1-8,MARTHA>我听着好像你在调查
<1-8,MARTHA>It sounded to me like you were looking into

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,310
<1-8,MARTHA>贝克特探长母亲的谋杀案
<1-8,MARTHA>Detective Beckett' s mother's murder.

24
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,180
<1-9,CASTLE>-你总是偷听  -我没有
<1-9,CASTLE>- Must you always eavesdrop? - I wasn't eavesdropping.

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,070
<1-10,MARTHA>只是碰巧从你办公室门口经过
<1-10,MARTHA>I happened to walk by your office door.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,000
<1-10,MARTHA>-而且我住这儿  -是的  我意识到了
<1-10,MARTHA>- I live here, too, you know. - Yes. I'm aware.

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,840
<1-12,MARTHA>她知道你在查她母亲的案子吗
<1-12,MARTHA>So does she know you're poking into her mother's case?

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,440
<1-13,CASTLE>还没有新发现  告诉她有什么用
<1-13,CASTLE>What's the sense in telling her until I find something new?

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,370
<1-14,MARTHA>有没有想过你在侵犯她的隐私
<1-14,MARTHA>Well, you ever stop to think you're invading her privacy?

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,330
<1-15,CASTLE>又不是偷看她的内衣抽屉
<1-15,CASTLE>I'm not poking through her underwear drawer.

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,280
<1-15,CASTLE>只是调查她母亲的谋杀案
<1-15,CASTLE>I'm investigating her mother's murder.

32
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,150
<1-16,MARTHA>你在开启她尘封的往事  亲爱的
<1-16,MARTHA>You are digging up her past, darling,

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,420
<1-16,MARTHA>没有经她允许
<1-16,MARTHA>Without her permission.

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,240
<1-16,MARTHA>现在你要么告诉她  要么放手不管
<1-16,MARTHA>Now you either tell her or leave it alone.

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,350
<1-17,ALEXIS>-天哪  老爸  老爸  -怎么了
<1-17,ALEXIS>- Oh, my gosh, dad! Dad, dad, dad! - What is it?

<1-21,ALEXIS>欧文  但我说要问问你
<1-21,ALEXIS>Owen. But I told him I had to ask you.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,390
<1-21,ALEXIS>不过我想你会同意的  对吧
<1-21,ALEXIS>But you'll say yes, right?

40
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,070
<1-21,ALEXIS>因为我已经答应他了
<1-21,ALEXIS>'Cause I told him yes.

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,330
<1-21,ALEXIS>-你一定要答应  答应我吧  -答应
<1-21,ALEXIS>- But you have to say yes, so say yes! - Yes?

<1-27,ALEXIS>-也不读四年级  -没错  但是欧文是三年级生
<1-27,ALEXIS>- Nor a senior. - True, but Owen' s a junior.

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,410
<1-28,CASTLE>欧文  我记得你说他只有15岁
<1-28,CASTLE>Owen? I thought you said he was only 15.

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,600
<1-29,CASTLE>他跳级了  他好帅啊  老爸
<1-29,CASTLE>Yeah, he skipped a grade. But he's so cute, dad.

<1-33,ALEXIS>-别  玩过头了  -老爸  我们只是牵牵手而已
<1-33,ALEXIS>- Not-Not too good a time. - Dad, all we've done is hold hands.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,980
<1-34,CASTLE>行了  详细情形不要说
<1-34,CASTLE>Ew, okay, please. Don't need details. Just...

<1-35,ALEXIS>这么说我可以去啦
<1-35,ALEXIS>So I can go?

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,970
<1-36,CASTLE>-当然可以  -我爱死你啦
<1-36,CASTLE>- Of course you can go. - Oh! I love you.

<1-39,ALEXIS>一件漂亮的礼服  礼服  礼服
<1-39,ALEXIS>A beautiful dress. A dress, a dress, a dress!

57
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,770
<1-40,MARTHA>-谢谢  老爸  -你喜欢这个叫欧文的吗
<1-40,MARTHA>- Thanks, dad! - So do you like this...Owen?

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,430
<1-41,CASTLE>不知道  我没见过他
<1-41,CASTLE>I don't know. I haven't met him.

59
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,080
<1-42,MARTHA>你让她和一个你从没见过的人
<1-42,MARTHA>You are letting her go out with someone

60
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,410
<1-42,MARTHA>去舞会
<1-42,MARTHA>That you've never met-

61
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,500
<1-42,MARTHA>你算什么父亲啊
<1-42,MARTHA>What kind of a father are you?

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,500
<2-1,BECKETT>我不会帮你调查你女儿的约会对象
<2-1,BECKETT>I'm not running a background check on your daughter's date.

63
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,030
<2-2,CASTLE>求你了  她说他很文静
<2-2,CASTLE>Oh, come on. She says he's quiet,

64
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,980
<2-2,CASTLE>很内向  而且跟父母一起住
<2-2,CASTLE>He keeps to himself, and he lives with his parents.

65
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,810
<2-2,CASTLE>你觉得他会是连环杀手吗
<2-2,CASTLE>Tell me that doesn't sound like a serial killer to you.

66
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,560
<2-3,ESPOSITO>谁是连环杀手
<2-3,ESPOSITO>Who's a serial killer?

67
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,050
<2-4,BECKETT>有人邀请卡塞尔的女儿去参加舞会
<2-4,BECKETT>Castle' s daughter Alexis got invited to prom.

68
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,570
<2-5,CASTLE>这是她第一次真正的约会
<2-5,CASTLE>It's her first real date.

69
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,080
<2-6,RYAN>你担心他是个连环杀手吗
<2-6,RYAN>And you're worried he's a serial killer?

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,410
<2-6,RYAN>-你该担心他年少冲动  -他才15岁
<2-6,RYAN>- You should be more worried he's a teenage boy. - Ah, he's only 15.

71
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,900
<2-8,RYAN>看电视和上网长大的一代
<2-8,RYAN>Between satellite TV and the internet,

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,250
<2-9,ESPOSITO>-15岁相当以前的25岁  -说得对  我也曾15岁过
<2-9,ESPOSITO>- 15's the new 25. - Dude's right. I was 15 once.

73
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,220
<2-10,RYAN>-现在还是  -如果我有个她这么大的女儿
<2-10,RYAN>- Still are. - If I had a daughter her age,

74
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,590
<2-11,ESPOSITO>-绝不会让她出门  -谢谢  伙计们
<2-11,ESPOSITO>- I'd never let her out of the house. - Thanks, guys.

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,420
<2-13,RYAN>几小时前  这车因违章停放被拖来
<2-13,RYAN>Car was towed in a few hours ago-parking violations.

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,200
<2-13,RYAN>管理员去查看汽车识别号
<2-13,RYAN>When the attendant went to look for the vin number,

77
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,910
<2-13,RYAN>发现被害人倒在车里  头部蒙着袋子
<2-13,RYAN>He found the vic slumped over with a bag on his head.

78
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,210
<2-14,CASTLE>六张违停罚单和一张拖车标签
<2-14,CASTLE>Six parking tickets and a tow sticker,

79
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,890
<2-14,CASTLE>就没人往车里看一眼吗
<2-14,CASTLE>And no one bothers to look inside?

80
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,910
<2-15,ESPOSITO>车窗贴了膜  挡风玻璃加了遮阳罩
<2-15,ESPOSITO>Tinted windows, sunshade on the windshield.

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,170
<2-16,CASTLE>你以为会有人想往里看一看
<2-16,CASTLE>You'd think someone would try to at least look inside.

82
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,000
<2-17,BECKETT>纽约欢迎你  知道身份了吗
<2-17,BECKETT>Yeah, welcome to New York. You got an I.D.?

83
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,230
<2-17,BECKETT>查到了  乔舒亚·利兹医生  37岁
<2-17,BECKETT>Yeah, Dr. Joshua Leeds, 37.

84
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,370
<2-18,ESPOSITO>根据他钱包里的名片看来
<2-18,ESPOSITO>According to the business cards in his wallet,

85
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,210
<2-18,ESPOSITO>他是个整容医生
<2-18,ESPOSITO>He's a plastic surgeon.

86
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,760
<2-18,ESPOSITO>车也是用他的身份登记的
<2-18,ESPOSITO>The car is also registered to him as well.

87
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,110
<2-20,ESPOSITO>-钱包里有钱吗  -有  几百块
<2-20,ESPOSITO>- Any money in the wallet? - Yeah, couple of hundred bucks.

88
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,640
<2-21,BECKETT>我想可以排除劫杀了
<2-21,BECKETT>Well, I guess we can rule out robbery.

89
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,140
<2-22,CASTLE>塑料袋和胶带
<2-22,CASTLE>A plastic bag and duct tape-

90
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,990
<2-22,CASTLE>不算是很有效的杀人手段
<2-22,CASTLE>Not a very efficient way to kill someone.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,460
<2-23,BECKETT>是啊  但是很有针对性
<2-23,BECKETT>No, but it's very personal.

92
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,390
<2-23,BECKETT>行了  通知家人吧
<2-23,BECKETT>All right, find and notify next of kin.

93
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,790
<2-23,BECKETT>看看他失踪了多久
<2-23,BECKETT>Let's see how long he's been missing.

94
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,410
<2-24,LANIE>从腐烂的程度看  估计有一周了
<2-24,LANIE>From the state of decay, I'd say about a week.

95
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,690
<2-25,RYAN>与第一张罚单的时间吻合
<2-25,RYAN>That matches the date on the first parking ticket.

96
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,470
<2-26,LANIE>初步诊断  死因是窒息
<2-26,LANIE>Preliminary cause of death indicates asphyxiation,

97
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,810
<2-26,LANIE>但我会做个毒性测验以防出错
<2-26,LANIE>But I'll run toxicology just in case.

98
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,900
<2-27,ESPOSITO>塑料袋这么薄  为什么不扯破它
<2-27,ESPOSITO>That bag's pretty thin. Why wouldn't he just rip it off?

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,910
<2-28,BECKETT>-肯定是被绑住了  -不只是这样
<2-28,BECKETT>-  He must've been restrained. -  That's only half the story.

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,580
<2-29,LANIE>他的手指甲被拔掉了
<2-29,LANIE>His fingernails were removed.

101
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,080
<2-29,LANIE>而且在死之前
<2-29,LANIE>And each finger presents signs

102
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,430
<2-29,LANIE>每根手指都被折断了
<2-29,LANIE>Of having been broken premortem.

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
<2-30,BECKETT>折断了
<2-30,BECKETT>Broken?

104
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,470
<2-31,LANIE>如果我没猜错  这医生死前
<2-31,LANIE>If I had to guess, I'd say our doctor was tortured

105
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,260
<2-31,LANIE>被狠狠的折磨过
<2-31,LANIE>Before he was killed.

107
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,800
<3-1,ESPOSITO>这是他未婚妻考特妮·莫兰兹
<3-1,ESPOSITO>His fiance Courtney Morantz.

108
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,970
<3-1,ESPOSITO>一周前报警说他失踪了
<3-1,ESPOSITO>She reported him missing a week ago.

109
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,370
<3-2,BECKETT>-鉴证科在车里有发现吗  -在查指纹  检验纤维
<3-2,BECKETT>- C.S.U. have any luck with the car? - They're running prints, testing fibers.

110
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,670
<3-3,ESPOSITO>明天应该就能拿到结果
<3-3,ESPOSITO>We should have results by tomorrow.

111
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,110
<3-4,BECKETT>好的  谢谢

<3-6,BECKETT>I'm very sorry about your loss.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
<3-6,BECKETT>能否占用你一点时间
<3-6,BECKETT>I was wondering if I could take a moment of your time.

116
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,090
<4-1,COURTNEY MORANTZ>我就知道
<4-1,COURTNEY MORANTZ>I knew it.

117
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,960
<4-1,COURTNEY MORANTZ>他没有回家  我就有预感要出事
<4-1,COURTNEY MORANTZ>When he didn't come home, I just felt it.

118
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,980
<4-2,CASTLE>你们订婚多久了
<4-2,CASTLE>How long were you engaged?

<4-3,COURTNEY MORANTZ>We were gonna get married next month, at the Gardens.

121
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,640
<4-3,COURTNEY MORANTZ>凶手要什么  钱吗
<4-3,COURTNEY MORANTZ>What did they want, money?

122
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,960
<4-4,BECKETT>看上去不像是劫杀
<4-4,BECKETT>It doesn't appear to be a robbery.

123
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,460
<4-5,COURTNEY MORANTZ>那是为什么
<4-5,COURTNEY MORANTZ>Then why?

124
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,400
<4-6,BECKETT>乔什有没有做什么事
<4-6,BECKETT>Was Josh involved in anything that might've brought him

125
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,630
<4-6,BECKETT>-以至于招来杀身之祸  -没有  乔什不会的
<4-6,BECKETT>- Into contact with criminal elements? - No. No, not my josh.

126
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,090
<4-7,COURTNEY MORANTZ>他不是这种人
<4-7,COURTNEY MORANTZ>That's just not who he was.

127
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,880
<4-8,CASTLE>他失踪的那天
<4-8,CASTLE>On the day he disappeared,

128
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,990
<4-8,CASTLE>-有发现他有何异常吗  -异常
<4-8,CASTLE>- Did you notice anything different about him? - Uh, different?

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,360
<4-10,BECKETT>他有没有显得担心  害怕或是心烦意乱
<4-10,BECKETT>Did he seem worried or scared or distracted?

130
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,220
<4-10,BECKETT>他很正常
<4-10,BECKETT>He was fine.

131
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,170
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>我们约好要见面
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>I mean, we were gonna meet,

132
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,350
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>准备一起去尝一尝结婚蛋糕
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>Because we were gonna go taste some cakes.

133
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,180
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>结果他没出现  我就打电话到他办公室
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>When he didn't show, I called the office

134
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,120
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>他们说他走了  我就打他手机
<4-11,COURTNEY MORANTZ>And they said he'd left, so I called his cell phone,

135
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,060
<4-12,CASTLE>-但是他没接  -他办公室在市中心
<4-12,CASTLE>- But he didn't pick up. - If his office was in midtown,

136
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,160
<4-12,CASTLE>你知不知道
<4-12,CASTLE>Do you have any idea

137
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,190
<4-12,CASTLE>-他的车为何停在133号大街  -133号大街
<4-12,CASTLE>- Why his car would be found on 133rd street? - 133rd street?

138
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,620
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>他从不往北跑那么远
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>He'd never go that far north.

139
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,530
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>他总是走市中心的隧道  再上长岛高速
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>He always took the midtown tunnel to the L.I.E.

140
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,010
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>而且要是他迟到了  会打电话告诉我
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>And if he was gonna be late, he'd call.

141
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,440
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>他总会打电话给我
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>He'd always call.

<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>总是让我知道
<4-13,COURTNEY MORANTZ>He'd always let me know.

143
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,470
<5-1,BECKETT>-查访有收获吗  -没有
<5-1,BECKETT>- Anything on the canvass? - Nada.

144
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,790
<5-2,RYAN>周围居民只记得开罚单之后见过那车
<5-2,RYAN>Locals only remember seeing the car after the tickets.

145
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,900
<5-2,RYAN>那条街上没有监控摄像头
<5-2,RYAN>No security cameras on the street.

146
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,100
<5-3,ESPOSITO>未婚妻说的话都属实
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Fiance's story checks out.

147
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,920
<5-3,ESPOSITO>蛋糕店证实她当时在那里等
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Cake shop confirms she was there waiting.

148
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,570
<5-4,RYAN>他要去格雷特内克的蛋糕店见未婚妻
<5-4,RYAN>Heading to meet his fiance at a cake shop in Great Neck,

149
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,690
<5-4,RYAN>怎么就死在了哈林区的街上
<5-4,RYAN>How'd he wind up dead on a street in Harlem?

150
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,500
<5-5,CASTLE>也许他有些秘密连她未婚妻都不知道
<5-5,CASTLE>Well, maybe he had secrets even his fiance didn't know about.

151
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,460
<5-5,CASTLE>比如他可能偷偷利用自己的技术
<5-5,CASTLE>Like maybe he secretly made a living out of

152
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,260
<5-5,CASTLE>偷走游客的器官
<5-5,CASTLE>Using his surgeon skills to harvest organs off of tourists

153
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,020
<5-5,CASTLE>再卖到黑市上
<5-5,CASTLE>For the black market organ trade.

154
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,140
<5-5,CASTLE>这素材不错  我要写下来
<5-5,CASTLE>Whoa, that was a good one. I'm writing that down.

155
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,480
<5-6,BECKETT>不要像他这样编故事
<5-6,BECKETT>So instead of making up stories,

156
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,930
<5-6,BECKETT>我们开始整理时间线吧
<5-6,BECKETT>We are going to establish a timeline.

157
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,980
<5-6,BECKETT>什么时候开的第一张罚单
<5-6,BECKETT>When did he get his first ticket?

158
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,450
<5-8,BECKETT>-上周三早上  -好  你们去市中心
<5-8,BECKETT>- Last Wednesday morning. - Okay, so you guys go to the midtown garage

159
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,320
<5-8,BECKETT>他放车的车库看看  我们去他办公室
<5-8,BECKETT>Where he kept his car, and we'll hit his office.

160
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,700
<5-9,ESPOSITO>-行  -好的
<5-9,ESPOSITO>- Cool. - Okay.

161
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,530
<5-11,CASTLE>问你件事行吗
<5-11,CASTLE>Hey, can I ask you something?

162
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,650
<5-12,BECKETT>什么时候你问问题还要求许可了
<5-12,BECKETT>Since when do you ask permission to ask questions?

163
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,310
<5-13,CASTLE>是关于你母亲的案子
<5-13,CASTLE>It's about your mother's case.

164
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,560
<5-14,CASTLE>你有没有想过  重新开始调查
<5-14,CASTLE>Have you ever thought about...reopening it?

165
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,050
<5-15,BECKETT>你想干什么
<5-15,BECKETT>What are you doing?

166
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,100
<5-16,CASTLE>-没什么  我是想如果一起调查  -不行
<5-16,CASTLE>- Nothing. I just thought if we worked together - No.

167
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,660
<5-18,CASTLE>我有办法
<5-18,CASTLE>I have resources.

168
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,850
<5-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你要是再敢碰我母亲的案子
<5-19,BECKETT>Castle, you touch my mom's case,

169
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,890
<5-19,BECKETT>我们就此结束
<5-19,BECKETT>And you and I are done.

170
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,140
<5-19,BECKETT>明白吗
<5-19,BECKETT>Do you understand?

171
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,600
<5-20,CASTLE>明白
<5-20,CASTLE>Okay.

172
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,320
<5-21,CASTLE>你为什么不想查
<5-21,CASTLE>Why don't you want to investigate it?

173
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:07,990
<5-21,CASTLE>道理一样
<5-21,CASTLE>Same reason

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,790
<5-22,BECKETT>戒酒了就不再沾
<5-22,BECKETT>A recovering alcoholic doesn't drink.

175
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,760
<5-22,BECKETT>你以为我没去过档案室吗
<5-22,BECKETT>You don't think I haven't been down there?

176
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,260
<5-22,BECKETT>你不知道
<5-22,BECKETT>You don't think

177
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,630
<5-22,BECKETT>我把那份档案的每句话都背下来了吗
<5-22,BECKETT>I haven't memorized every line in that file?

178
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,130
<5-22,BECKETT>入警局的头三年
<5-22,BECKETT>My first three years on the force,

179
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,610
<5-22,BECKETT>不当班的时候我一直在检查
<5-22,BECKETT>Every off-Duty moment was spent looking

180
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,200
<5-22,BECKETT>是否有被忽略的线索
<5-22,BECKETT>For something someone missed.

181
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,970
<5-22,BECKETT>我做了一年的心理治疗才明白
<5-22,BECKETT>It took me a year of therapy to realize

182
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,530
<5-22,BECKETT>要是我不放手的话  这案子会毁了我
<5-22,BECKETT>If I didn't let it go, it was gonna destroy me.

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,820
<5-22,BECKETT>所以我放手了
<5-22,BECKETT>And so I let it go.

184
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,650
<5-23,CASTLE>对不起
<5-23,CASTLE>Sorry.

185
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,030
<5-23,CASTLE>之前我不知道
<5-23,CASTLE>I didn't know.

186
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,510
<5-24,BECKETT>是啊  现在你知道了吧
<5-24,BECKETT>Yeah, well now you do.

187
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,310
<6-1,BECKETT>就是这里
<6-1,BECKETT>Well, this must be the place.

188
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,740
<6-3,BECKETT>男人和胸部是什么关系呢
<6-3,BECKETT>What is it with men and boobs, anyway?

189
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,320
<6-4,CASTLE>生理反应  无法克制
<6-4,CASTLE>It's biological. We can't help it.

190
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,460
<6-5,BECKETT>难道你没觉得
<6-5,BECKETT>But doesn't it bother you

191
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,080
<6-5,BECKETT>那对显然不是真的吗
<6-5,BECKETT>That they're so obviously not real?

192
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,990
<6-6,CASTLE>圣诞老人不是真的
<6-6,CASTLE>Santa's not real.

193
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,810
<6-6,CASTLE>但是我们都喜欢他的礼物
<6-6,CASTLE>We still love opening his presents.

194
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,160
<7-1,ASSISTANT JULIA>他不太可能失踪
<7-1,ASSISTANT JULIA>It wasn't like him to disappear.

195
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,570
<7-1,ASSISTANT JULIA>我觉得内心深处我们都知道
<7-1,ASSISTANT JULIA>I think that, deep down, we all knew that, um,

196
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,730
<7-1,ASSISTANT JULIA>出事了
<7-1,ASSISTANT JULIA>That something was wrong.

197
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,870
<7-3,JULIA>-他有没有显出焦躁  -没有  跟往常一样
<7-3,JULIA>- Did he seem agitated at all? - No, I mean, it was pretty much business as usual.

198
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,130
<7-4,ASSISTANT MARIO>除了婚礼
<7-4,ASSISTANT MARIO>Except for the wedding.

199
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,110
<7-4,ASSISTANT MARIO>我们尽量帮他空出时间让他去度蜜月
<7-4,ASSISTANT MARIO>We were trying to clear his schedule for the honeymoon.

200
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,740
<7-5,BECKETT>你们最后一次见到他是什么时候
<7-5,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw him?

201
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,360
<7-6,JULIA>上周二  他正要去见他未婚妻
<7-6,JULIA>Last Tuesday. He was on his way to meet his fiance.

202
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,430
<7-7,CASTLE>什么时候离开办公室
<7-7,CASTLE>What time did he leave the office?

203
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,820
<7-9,MARIO>-大概五点半  -是的
<7-9,MARIO>- Around 5:30. - Yeah.

204
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,800
<7-10,JULIA>我六点钟打电话给他  还好好的
<7-10,JULIA>When I called at 6:00, he was fine.

205
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,890
<7-11,ASSISTANT MAGGIE>-他说隧道里堵车  -就是说他离开了曼哈顿
<7-11,ASSISTANT MAGGIE>- He said he was in traffic at the tunnel. - He'd left Manhattan then.

206
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,000
<7-13,CASTLE>为什么又回来呢
<7-13,CASTLE>Why would he come back?

207
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,960
<7-14,BECKETT>利兹医生有仇人吗
<7-14,BECKETT>Did Dr. Leeds have any enemies,

208
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,080
<7-14,BECKETT>有没有对他的手术导致并发症
<7-14,BECKETT>Anyone that he had operated on who had had complications

209
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,360
<7-14,BECKETT>或者失败手术的病人
<7-14,BECKETT>Or a bad experience?

210
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,950
<7-15,JULIA>他的病人从没有过并发症
<7-15,JULIA>None of his patients had complications.

211
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,150
<7-16,MARIO>那也不能说明病人都开心
<7-16,MARIO>That doesn't mean that they were always happy.

212
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,220
<7-16,MARIO>整形手术关乎自我形象
<7-16,MARIO>Cosmetic surgery is about self-image.

213
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,790
<7-16,MARIO>对某些人来说  这能改变他们一生
<7-16,MARIO>For some people, it changes their lives.

214
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,590
<7-16,MARIO>对于另一些人  怎么做都不够
<7-16,MARIO>For others, nothing's ever enough.

215
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,380
<7-17,BECKETT>有没有病人曾威胁过他
<7-17,BECKETT>Did any of his patients ever threaten him?

216
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,690
<7-18,JULIA>有一个  叫杰西·戈德伯格
<7-18,JULIA>One. Jacey Goldberg.

217
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,230
<7-18,JULIA>她曾是利兹医生的病人  直到三个月前
<7-18,JULIA>She was a patient of Dr. Leeds until about three months ago.

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,090
<7-20,JULIA>-出什么事了  -她要做面部拉皮手术
<7-20,JULIA>- What happened? - She wanted a face-Lift.

219
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,620
<7-21,BECKETT>-又怎样呢  -她做过三次这种手术
<7-21,BECKETT>- So? - So she already had three,

220
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,200
<7-22,MARIO>利兹医生不愿再给她做
<7-22,MARIO>And Dr. Leeds refused to perform the operation.

221
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,910
<7-23,CASTLE>-那么她怎么办呢  -控告他
<7-23,CASTLE>- So what'd she do? - She sued him.

222
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
<7-24,JULIA>当然案子被驳回
<7-24,JULIA>It was thrown out of court, of course.

223
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,930
<7-25,MAGGIE>接着恐吓就开始了
<7-25,MAGGIE>That's when the threats started.

224
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,930
<8-1,MONTGOMERY>至少   以触犯自然法则之名
<8-1,MONTGOMERY>At the very least, she should be arrested

225
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,460
<8-1,MONTGOMERY>逮捕她
<8-1,MONTGOMERY>For violating the laws of nature.

226
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,610
<8-2,ESPOSITO>杰茜·戈德伯格的丈夫杰克
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Check this out- Jacey Goldberg's husband Jack

227
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,410
<8-2,ESPOSITO>一个月前将妻子委托给贝尔维尤
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Had her committed to Bellevue a month ago

228
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,070
<8-2,ESPOSITO>为她的整容成瘾做精神治疗
<8-2,ESPOSITO>For psychiatric treatment for her little obsession.

229
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,500
<8-3,RYAN>猜猜谁证明她需要治疗
<8-3,RYAN>Guess who testified in support of her commitment?

230
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,170
<8-4,BECKETT>乔舒亚·利兹医生
<8-4,BECKETT>Dr. Joshua Leeds.

231
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,110
<8-5,RYAN>一个月强制治疗计划
<8-5,RYAN>Mandatory 1- month treatment program

232
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,600
<8-5,RYAN>她上周出院
<8-5,RYAN>She was released last week.

233
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,220
<8-6,ESPOSITO>就在医生失踪前3天
<8-6,ESPOSITO>3 days before our doctor missing

234
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,450
<8-7,CASTLE>精神有问题的整形狂人
<8-7,CASTLE>Mentally unstable plastic surgery chick.

235
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,550
<8-7,CASTLE>比器官买卖强多了  让她来一趟
<8-7,CASTLE>That is way better than harvesting organs. Get her in here.

236
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,840
<9-2,ESPOSITO>瞧瞧她
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Look at her.

237
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,700
<9-2,ESPOSITO>-谁会这样作践自己  -没错
<9-2,ESPOSITO>- How can anyone do that to themselves?   -Right?

238
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,650
<9-3,CASTLE>她像是从《冲出人魔岛》逃出生天
<9-3,CASTLE>It's like she escaped from "the island of Dr. Moreau."

239
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,840
<9-4,BECKETT>得了  她不是动物  她是个人
<9-4,BECKETT>Come on, guys, she's not an animal. She's a human being.

240
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,480
<9-5,CASTLE>我知道  但
<9-5,CASTLE>Yeah, I know, but...

241
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,110
<9-5,CASTLE>你认真的  还是引用《象人》[电影主角是畸形人]的台词
<9-5,CASTLE>Wait, are you being sincere or quoting "the elephant man"?

242
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,800
<9-5,CASTLE>真粗俗
<9-5,CASTLE>Oh. Saucy.

243
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,990
<9-5,CASTLE>戈德伯格夫人  我是贝克特探员
<9-5,CASTLE>Mrs. Goldberg, I'm detective Beckett.

244
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,870
<10-1,BECKETT>这是理查德·卡塞尔顾问
<10-1,BECKETT>This is Richard Castle, a consultant with the department

245
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,290
<10-1,BECKETT>这是怎么回事  探长
<10-1,BECKETT>What's this all about, detective?

246
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,390
<10-2,BECKETT>戈德伯格夫人  你认识一位整容医生
<10-2,BECKETT>Mrs. Goldberg, are you familiar with a plastic surgeon

247
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,140
<10-2,BECKETT>乔舒亚·利兹
<10-2,BECKETT>Named Dr. Joshua Leeds?

248
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,960
<10-3,BECKETT>是的
<10-3,BECKETT>Yes.

249
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,190
<10-3,BECKETT>-你最近起诉他失职  -没错
<10-3,BECKETT>- You recently sued him for malpractice.   - That's correct.

250
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,450
<10-4,BECKETT>“拒绝做可选性整容手术
<10-4,BECKETT>"For refusing to perform elective cosmetic surgery,

251
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,980
<10-4,BECKETT>"尤其是面部拉皮  植入和抽脂”
<10-4,BECKETT>"specifically a face-lift, facial implants And liposuction."

252
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,170
<10-4,BECKETT>我可以保证  每一项都是医学必须的
<10-4,BECKETT>I can assure you, each procedure was medically necessary.

253
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,080
<10-5,CASTLE>利兹医生却不这样认为
<10-5,CASTLE>Dr. Leeds didn't seem to think so.

254
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,360
<10-5,CASTLE>那自大的混蛋以为自己是上帝
<10-5,CASTLE>That arrogant bastard thought he can play God

255
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,090
<10-6,CASTLE>既然这么想整容
<10-6,CASTLE>Well, if you wanted the surgery so badly,

256
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,110
<10-6,CASTLE>为什么不整整你的嘴唇
<10-6,CASTLE>Why didn't you just see another lips?

257
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,180
<10-6,CASTLE>看其他医生
<10-6,CASTLE>Doc-doctor.

258
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,880
<10-6,CASTLE>因为我要最好的医生
<10-6,CASTLE>Because I wanted the best.

259
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,070
<10-6,CASTLE>却拒绝给我最好的手术
<10-6,CASTLE>Who is he to deny me the best?

260
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,250
<10-7,CASTLE>因此你威胁要毁了他
<10-7,CASTLE>So you threaten to ruin him

261
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,410
<10-7,CASTLE>他凭什么替我决定一切
<10-7,CASTLE>Why does he get to tell me what I can and cannot do?

262
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,800
<10-8,BECKETT>又凭什么决定我的容貌
<10-8,BECKETT>Why does he get to decide what I look

263
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,810
<10-8,BECKETT>这就是你杀他的动机
<10-8,BECKETT>Is that why you killed him?

264
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,410
<10-9,CASTLE>-什么  -利兹医生上周被杀了
<10-9,CASTLE>- What?  - Dr. Leeds was murdered last week.

265
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,060
<10-10,BECKETT>-谋杀  -就在你精神治疗
<10-10,BECKETT>- Murdered?   - A couple of days after you were released

266
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,650
<10-10,BECKETT>出院后的几天
<10-10,BECKETT>From the psychiatric treatment facility

267
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,440
<10-10,BECKETT>利兹医生让你去的治疗
<10-10,BECKETT>That Leeds helped commit you to.

268
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,170
<10-10,BECKETT>这就是作案动机和时机  顾问
<10-10,BECKETT>That's motive and opportunity, counselor.

269
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,990
<10-10,BECKETT>我说过毁了他  不是杀他  区别大着呢
<10-10,BECKETT>I said I'd ruin him, not kill him. Big difference.

270
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,270
<10-11,BECKETT>我想你愿意告诉我
<10-11,BECKETT>Then I suppose you won't mind telling me

271
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,230
<10-11,BECKETT>上周二晚上去了哪里
<10-11,BECKETT>Where you were last Tuesday night.

272
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,150
<11-1,MONTGOMERY>她当时在哪里
<11-1,MONTGOMERY>So where was she?

273
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,430
<11-2,BECKETT>她在医院
<11-2,BECKETT>She was...in the hospital.

274
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,330
<11-3,MONTGOMERY>-又做整容手术  -没错
<11-3,MONTGOMERY>- Getting more surgery?   - Yep.

275
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,630
<11-5,MONTGOMERY>她还剩下什么地方没整
<11-5,MONTGOMERY>What's she got left to operate on?

276
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,680
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>-不是吧  -就是
<11-6,MONTGOMERY>- Oh, no.   - Oh, yes.

277
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,790
<11-8,MONTGOMERY>认真的  他们还能整成什么样
<11-8,MONTGOMERY>Seriously? What could they possibly do down there?

278
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,660
<11-9,BECKETT>明显还有很多
<11-9,BECKETT>Well, apparently, quite a lot. Ugh.

279
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,860
<11-10,MONTGOMERY>如果利兹出了名经常拒绝手术
<11-10,MONTGOMERY>But if Leeds had a reputation of turning people away,

280
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,390
<11-10,MONTGOMERY>也许他还惹毛过其他人
<11-10,MONTGOMERY>Maybe there's someone else out there he pissed off.

281
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,850
<11-11,BECKETT>埃斯波西托和莱恩在检查病人名单
<11-11,BECKETT>Yeah, Esposito and Ryan are looking through the patient list,

282
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,940
<11-11,BECKETT>但鉴证组没在车上发现什么线索
<11-11,BECKETT>But the C.S.U. Came back clean from the car.

283
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,140
<11-11,BECKETT>普通仇杀不可能
<11-11,BECKETT>It would be almost impossible for a run-of-the-mill

284
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,810
<11-11,BECKETT>做的这么干净
<11-11,BECKETT>Revenge murderer to be that invisible.

285
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,730
<11-12,MONTGOMERY>-你认为是职业杀手干的  -不知道
<11-12,MONTGOMERY>- You thinking it's professional?  - I don't know.

286
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,040
<11-13,BECKETT>戈德伯格夫人有钱雇凶
<11-13,BECKETT>Mrs. Goldberg had enough money to pay someone to do it,

287
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,690
<11-13,BECKETT>但她的手术却是完美的不在场证据
<11-13,BECKETT>Then her surgery is a pretty convenient alibi.

288
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,220
<11-13,BECKETT>但折磨后闷死  却不像是50岁
<11-13,BECKETT>But torture and suffocation? That doesn't seem like the work

289
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,490
<11-13,BECKETT>生活不顺的主妇行事作风
<11-13,BECKETT>Of a disgruntled trophy wife turning 50.

290
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,840
<11-14,MONTGOMERY>断指的医生  有人在传递信息
<11-14,MONTGOMERY>A surgeon with a broken finger says someone sending a message.

291
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,780
<12-1,ALEXIS>怎么样
<12-1,ALEXIS>What do you think?

292
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,530
<12-2,CASTLE>你很美
<12-2,CASTLE>You look beautiful.

293
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,770
<12-3,ALEXIS>爸爸  每条裙子你都这样说
<12-3,ALEXIS>Dad, you say that about every dress.

294
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,070
<12-3,ALEXIS>不觉得这显得我很苍白吗
<12-3,ALEXIS>Don't you think this makes my skin look pasty?

295
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,420
<12-4,CASTLE>甜心  只想让你知道
<12-4,CASTLE>Sweetheart, I want you to know,

296
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,260
<12-4,CASTLE>无论你觉得怎样
<12-4,CASTLE>No matter how you think you look,

297
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,290
<12-4,CASTLE>你本来就很美
<12-4,CASTLE>You are perfect exactly the way you are.

298
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,800
<12-5,ALEXIS>一点忙也帮不上
<12-5,ALEXIS>You're not helping.

299
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,430
<12-6,MARTHA>-天啊  真难看  -谢谢
<12-6,MARTHA>- Oh, god. No. Hideous.   - Thank you.

300
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,210
<12-7,ALEXIS>试试这条
<12-7,ALEXIS>Here. Try this.

301
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,210
<12-8,MARTHA>颜色很称你
<12-8,MARTHA>All right. Good color for you.

302
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,980
<5-15,BECKETT>-你在做什么  -什么
<5-15,BECKETT>- What are you doing?   - What?

303
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,560
<12-10,MARTHA>“真难看”  你想造成她的自我形象问题吗
<12-10,MARTHA>"you look hideous" Are you trying to give her body-image issues?

304
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,730
<12-11,CASTLE>真过时  她已经有自我形象问题了
<12-11,CASTLE>Oh news flash, she already have body-image issue

305
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,420
<12-12,MARTHA>每个女人都有这样的问题
<12-12,MARTHA>It's an intrinsic part of being a woman.

306
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,320
<12-12,MARTHA>世上的每个女人
<12-12,MARTHA>Every woman in the world

<12-12,MARTHA>总会讨厌身体的某一部分
<12-12,MARTHA>Has some part of herself that she absolutely hates.

308
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,130
<12-12,MARTHA>手太小  脚太大
<12-12,MARTHA>Her hands are too small, her feet are too big,

309
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,250
<12-12,MARTHA>头发太直  太卷  耳朵突出来
<12-12,MARTHA>Her hair's too straight, too curly, her ears stick out,

310
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,060
<12-12,MARTHA>她的屁股太扁了
<12-12,MARTHA>Her-oh, god- her butt's too flat,

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,560
<12-12,MARTHA>鼻子太大
<12-12,MARTHA>Her nose is too big, and, you know,

312
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,750
<12-12,MARTHA>你所说的  并不能改变我们的感受
<12-12,MARTHA>Nothing you can say will change how we feel.

313
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,090
<12-12,MARTHA>男人不明白的是  合身的衣服
<12-12,MARTHA>What men don't understand is, the right clothes,

314
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,210
<12-12,MARTHA>合穿的鞋子  得体的妆容
<12-12,MARTHA>The right shoes, the right makeup just-

315
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,170
<12-12,MARTHA>很好地遮盖了我们认为难看的瑕疵
<12-12,MARTHA>It-it hides the flaws we think we have.

316
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,300
<12-12,MARTHA>让我们觉得自己漂亮
<12-12,MARTHA>They make us look beautiful to ourselves.

317
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,960
<12-12,MARTHA>也让他人觉得我们漂亮
<12-12,MARTHA>That's what makes us look beautiful to others.

318
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
<12-13,CASTLE>曾几何时
<12-13,CASTLE>Used to be...

319
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,000
<12-13,CASTLE>让她美丽动人的
<12-13,CASTLE>All she needed to feel beautiful

320
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,820
<12-13,CASTLE>是粉色芭蕾舞裙和塑料皇冠
<12-13,CASTLE>Was a pink tutu and a plastic tiara.

321
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,960
<12-14,MARTHA>我们穷其一生都想重温这种感觉
<12-14,MARTHA>We spend our whole lives trying to feel that way again.

322
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,310
<12-14,MARTHA>觉得怎样

00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,960
<12-14,MARTHA>就是你了
<12-14,MARTHA>I think it's you.

324
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,490
<13-1,RYAN>翻看了所有的档案
<13-1,RYAN>Staff just went through all the files.

325
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,640
<13-1,RYAN>没有危险人物  你查到什么秘密吗
<13-1,RYAN>No other red flags. Any dark secrets in here?

326
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,820
<13-2,ESPOSITO>有  利兹医生有个弱点
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah... Dr. Leeds had a weakness.

327
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,340
<13-2,ESPOSITO>能量棒
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Energy bars.

328
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,130
<13-2,ESPOSITO>他是国际医生协会的自愿者
<13-2,ESPOSITO>He volunteered at doctors international,

329
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,010
<13-2,ESPOSITO>作公益事业  这家伙是个童子军
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Did pro bono work. The guy's a boy scout.

330
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,580
<13-2,ESPOSITO>他电脑里甚至没有A片
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Hell, he didn't even have any porn on his computer.

331
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,580
<13-3,RYAN>真奇怪
<13-3,RYAN>That's weird.

332
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,400
<13-4,ESPOSITO>没错  知道他上锁抽屉有什么吗
<13-4,ESPOSITO>I know. You know what he had in his locked desk drawer?

333
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,370
<13-5,RYAN>中文字幕
<13-5,RYAN>?? Scotch

334
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,220
<13-6,ESPOSITO>支票本  抽屉里锁的是支票本
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Checkbook. The guy locked up his checkbook.

335
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,160
<13-7,RYAN>-这些文件夹是什么  -婚礼资料
<13-7,RYAN>- What about these folders? - Wedding stuff-

336
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,980
<13-8,ESPOSITO>礼服订金  酒席发票
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Tux deposits, catering invoices.

337
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,300
<13-9,RYAN>也许是疯狂的夫妇
<13-9,RYAN>Maybe some angry couple killed him

338
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,070
<13-9,RYAN>为了婚礼地点才杀了他
<13-9,RYAN>For their wedding venue, hmm?

339
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,770
<13-10,ESPOSITO>推理的不错
<13-10,ESPOSITO>It's as good a theory as any.

340
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,540
<13-11,RYAN>这些不全是婚礼资料
<13-11,RYAN>These aren't all wedding files.

341
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,790
<13-12,ESPOSITO>奇怪
<13-12,ESPOSITO>That's odd.

342
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,810
<13-12,ESPOSITO>病人的信息都被隐去
<13-12,ESPOSITO>All the patient information is blacked out.

343
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,970
<13-13,RYAN>也许利兹医生终究有自己的小秘密
<13-13,RYAN>Maybe Dr. Leeds has a secret after all.

344
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,990
<13-14,JULIA>是他的笔迹  但
<13-14,JULIA>It's his handwriting, but...

345
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,230
<13-14,JULIA>我从未见过这个档案
<13-14,JULIA>I've never seen this file before.

346
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,270
<13-15,ESPOSITO>你知道这病人是谁吗
<13-15,ESPOSITO>Can you identify that patient?

347
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,190
<13-16,JULIA>这里没写
<13-16,JULIA>Not from his notes.

348
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,770
<13-16,JULIA>只说明是个男性  55岁
<13-16,JULIA>Just that it was a male, 55 years old.

349
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,840
<13-17,RYAN>这个程序是怎么回事
<13-17,RYAN>How about this kind of procedure?

350
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,990
<13-18,JULIA>这不可能  我是他的护士长
<13-18,JULIA>This is impossible. I'm his primary nurse.

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,280
<13-18,JULIA>我管理手术小组  没有我他不能做手术
<13-18,JULIA>I run his surgical team. He never operates without me.

352
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,730
<13-19,ESPOSITO>显然  他做了手术
<13-19,ESPOSITO>Apparently, he did.

353
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,600
<13-20,JULIA>马里奥  查查利兹医生的日程
<13-20,JULIA>Mario, check on Dr. Leeds' calendar.

354
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,620
<13-20,JULIA>3月18号的安排
<13-20,JULIA>What do you have for march 18th?

355
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
<13-21,MARIO>他应该去墨西
<13-21,MARIO>He... Was supposed to be down at mercy

356
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,910
<13-21,MARIO>出席整形外科的专家组会
<13-21,MARIO>Attending a panel on reconstructive surgery.

357
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,060
<13-22,JULIA>他为什么撒谎
<13-22,JULIA>Why would he lie?

358
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,360
<13-22,JULIA>没有我  他怎么做了手术
<13-22,JULIA>Why would he operate without me?

359
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,990
<14-1,ESPOSITO>据医院说  手术进行了9个小时
<14-1,ESPOSITO>According to the hospital, the procedure lasted nine hours.

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,170
<14-1,ESPOSITO>助手和麻醉师都不是医院的人
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Neither the assisting nor the anesthesiologist were with the hospital.

361
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,870
<14-1,ESPOSITO>都是利兹医生带来的人
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Both were brought in by Dr. Leeds.

362
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,590
<14-1,ESPOSITO>可也不是他自己的人
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Neither of his regulars.

363
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,910
<14-2,MONTGOMERY>9小时神秘的手术
<14-2,MONTGOMERY>A 9-hour mystery operation

364
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,230
<14-2,MONTGOMERY>他不想自己人知道
<14-2,MONTGOMERY>He didn't want his own people to know about.

365
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,770
<14-3,BECKETT>医院肯定有病人的记录
<14-3,BECKETT>The hospital must've had some record of the patient.

366
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,220
<14-4,RYAN>医院找不到记录
<14-4,RYAN>Get this-the hospital can't find the file.

367
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,340
<14-5,CASTLE>-好像没发生过一样  -你问的是谁
<14-5,CASTLE>-It's like it never happened. -Who did you talk to?

368
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,400
<14-6,RYAN>-病人资料处  -那你错了
<14-6,RYAN>- Patient information. - Well...that was your first mistake.

369
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,130
<14-7,CASTLE>想在医院里找个病人
<14-7,CASTLE>If you want to find someone at a hospital who had a treatment there

370
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,200
<14-7,CASTLE>只有一个部门
<14-7,CASTLE>There's only one department

371
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,320
<14-7,CASTLE>什么资料也跑不了
<14-7,CASTLE>To go to where nothing ever falls through the cracks.

372
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,250
<14-7,CASTLE>收费处
<14-7,CASTLE>Billing.

373
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,240
<14-7,CASTLE>总得有人买单
<14-7,CASTLE>Someone had to pay for it, right?

374
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,110
<14-7,CASTLE>谢谢
<14-7,CASTLE>Thank you.

375

<14-8,BECKETT>No, I appreciate it.

376
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,530
<14-8,BECKETT>看来我们神秘病人的账单
<14-8,BECKETT>Well, it looks like our mystery patient's hospital bills

377

<14-8,BECKETT>-已经迅速付清了  -谁付的
<14-8,BECKETT>- Were paid promptly and in full. -By whom?

<14-10,BECKETT>Wire transfer. Esposito. Yeah.

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,340
<14-13,ESPOSITO>-查查这个帐号  -好的
<14-13,ESPOSITO>- See what you can find on this account number.  - All right.

380
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,340
<14-14,BECKETT>-阿丽克西斯挑到礼服了吗  -很可爱
<14-14,BECKETT>- So did Alexis find a dress yet? - Yeah. A cute one, too.

381
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,550
<14-15,CASTLE>天  真不敢相信我女儿要参加舞会了
<14-15,CASTLE>Boy. I can't believe my little girl's going to prom.

382
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,800
<14-15,CASTLE>我唯一的安慰  是折磨女儿男友的传统
<14-15,CASTLE>My only comfort now is the long-standing tradition of torturing the boyfriend

383
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,600
<14-16,BECKETT>什么意思
<14-16,BECKETT>What do you mean?

384
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,510
<14-17,CASTLE>当我和他单独相处时
<14-17,CASTLE>You know, the time-honored hazing that goes on

385
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,130
<14-17,CASTLE>等我女儿下楼的那一刻
<14-17,CASTLE>In those few moments we share where he and I are alone

386
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,700
<14-17,CASTLE>我就可以好好折磨那小子
<14-17,CASTLE>Just before my daughter descends the stairs.

387
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,220
<14-18,RYAN>我记得和我女友老爸见面时的恐惧
<14-18,RYAN>I remember the terror of meeting my date's old man.

388
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,570
<14-19,CASTLE>-他怎么做  -没收我钱包里的套套
<14-19,CASTLE>- What did he do?   - Checked my wallet for condoms,

389
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,040
<14-20,RYAN>向我展示他的手枪收藏
<14-20,RYAN>Showed me his gun collection.

390
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,890
<14-20,RYAN>我的手抖的厉害  连胸花都戴不好
<14-20,RYAN>My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely put corsage on

391
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,390
<14-21,CASTLE>你爸又怎么做
<14-21,CASTLE>What'd your dad do?

392
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,480
<14-22,BECKETT>我不知道  我当时在房里
<14-22,BECKETT>I... I don't know. I was in my room.

393
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,160
<14-23,CASTLE>当你出现后  你的男友怎样
<14-23,CASTLE>How was your date when you finally came out

394
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,880
<14-24,BECKETT>经你提起  他好像挺害怕的
<14-24,BECKETT>You know what. Now that you mention it, he looked terrified.

395
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,590
<14-24,BECKETT>我一直以为他怕我
<14-24,BECKETT>And this whole time, I thought he was scared of me.

396
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,460
<14-25,CASTLE>不是  现在到我出手了
<14-25,CASTLE>Nope. And now it's my turn.

397
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,990
<14-26,RYAN>你打算怎么做
<14-26,RYAN>What are you planning?

398
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,700
<14-27,CASTLE>符合我卡塞尔风格的事
<14-27,CASTLE>Something be fitting name the Castle.

399
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,540
<14-28,ESPOSITO>你们一定不会相信的
<14-28,ESPOSITO>Yo, you're never gonna believe this.

400
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,420
<14-29,BECKETT>-发现什么  -猜猜看汇款帐号
<14-29,BECKETT>-What'd you find?  -That account the money was wired from?

401
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,350
<14-30,ESPOSITO>来自美国司法部
<14-30,ESPOSITO>It belongs to the U.S. Attorney's office.

402
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,330
<14-30,ESPOSITO>不知道是什么手术  是政府买单
<14-30,ESPOSITO>Whatever the procedure was, uncle Sam paid for it.

403
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,880
<14-31,CASTLE>肯定不是隆胸手术
<14-31,CASTLE>I guess we can rule out boob job.

404
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,490
<14-32,RYAN>为什么司法部要为整容手术买单呢
<14-32,RYAN>Why would the D.O.J. pay for a cosmetic procedure?

405
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,190
<14-33,BECKETT>唯一原因  替某人改头换面
<14-33,BECKETT>There's only one reason- to change someone's identity.

406
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,170
<14-34,ESPOSITO>你觉得神秘人是受保护证人
<14-34,ESPOSITO>So you think the guy was in witness protection?

407
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,510
<14-35,CASTLE>利兹医生受折磨而死  凶手要找神秘人
<14-35,CASTLE>If Dr. Leeds was tortured, I think our killer is trying to find this guy.

408
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,470
<14-36,BECKETT>那我们要抢先找到他
<14-36,BECKETT>Then we better find him first.

409
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,630
<14-37,CASTLE>你怎么找受保护证人
<14-37,CASTLE>How do you find someone who's in witness protection?

410
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,130
<14-38,BECKETT>问保护他的人
<14-38,BECKETT>We ask the people who were protecting him

411
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,060
<14-39,RYAN>问“硬糖”  祝你好运
<14-39,RYAN>Ask "hard candy"? Good luck.

412
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,760
<14-40,CASTLE>"硬糖"是谁
<14-40,CASTLE>Hard-hard candy?

413

<14-41,ESPOSITO>坎迪斯·罗宾逊  联邦助理检察长
<14-41,ESPOSITO>Assistant U.S. Attorney Candace Robinson.

414
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,850
<14-41,ESPOSITO>让歹徒大哭的人
<14-41,ESPOSITO>She makes mobsters cry.

415
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,990
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>抱歉  探长  但你知道
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>I'm sorry, detective, but you must know that

416
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,570
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>受保护证人的资料是绝密的
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>Information on a protected witness is confidential.

417
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,940
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>就算你有我们雇佣利兹医生的证据
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>Whether or not you have proof that we employed Dr. Leeds

418
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,130
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>也就算你们有动手术的证据
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>Or whether or not you have proof that an operation to pay

419
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,460
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>都与我无关
<14-42,CANDACE ROBINSON>Is irrelevant.

420
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,960
<14-43,BECKETT>与我的受害人有关
<14-43,BECKETT>Not to my victim it's not.

421
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,140
<14-43,BECKETT>与他的家人有关
<14-43,BECKETT>Not to his family

422
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,040
<14-43,BECKETT>与他的未婚妻有关
<14-43,BECKETT>And certainly not to his fiance.

423
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,340
<14-43,BECKETT>他们打算厮守终生  但已经没有机会
<14-43,BECKETT>They were planning a life together that they will never have.

424
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,210
<14-43,BECKETT>我很同情你的处境
<14-43,BECKETT>Look, I am not unsympathetic to your situation,

425
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,180
<14-44,BECKETT>但我们都有自己的本职工作
<14-44,BECKETT>But we all have our jobs to do.

426
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,660
<14-44,BECKETT>罗宾逊小姐
<14-44,BECKETT>Ms. Robinson, doesn't it matter to you

427
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,040
<14-44,BECKETT>你雇的医生被杀了
<14-44,BECKETT>That the man that you employed was killed

428
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,730
<14-44,BECKETT>凶手很可能在找你的证人
<14-44,BECKETT>And whoever murdered him might be looking for your witness?

429
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,330
<14-44,BECKETT>探长
<14-44,BECKETT>Detective,

430
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,050
<14-45,CASTLE>你想我透露的是
<14-45,CASTLE>You are asking me to expose a witness

431
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,350
<14-45,CASTLE>一个正在接受联邦调查的证人
<14-45,CASTLE>During an ongoing federal investigation,

432
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,720
<14-46,BECKETT>告诉你  这是不可能的
<14-46,BECKETT>And I am telling you, that is not going to happen.

433
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,810
<14-46,BECKETT>现在怎么办  这个证人是关键
<14-46,BECKETT>So what now? This witness of theirs is key.

434
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,910
<14-46,BECKETT>不知道证人身份
<14-46,BECKETT>Without knowing who he is

435
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,000
<14-46,BECKETT>也不知道谁在追杀他
<14-46,BECKETT>Or who's after him,

436
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,540
<14-46,BECKETT>无法安排下一步行动
<14-46,BECKETT>There's no way of getting to the next step.

437
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,070
<14-47,CASTLE>还有个办法
<14-47,CASTLE>There's another way

438
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,800
<14-47,CASTLE>-能确定证人身份  -可以吗  怎么做
<14-47,CASTLE>- We could figure out who that witness is. - Yeah? How?

439
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,990
<14-49,CASTLE>坎迪斯·罗宾逊办公室几乎只负责
<14-49,CASTLE>Candace Robinson's office deals almost exclusively

440
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,760
<14-49,CASTLE>-有组织罪案  -所以呢
<14-49,CASTLE>- With organized crime. - So?

441
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,550
<14-51,CASTLE>如果问问对方呢
<14-51,CASTLE>So what if we ask the other side?

442
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,710
<14-52,BECKETT>你想问黑社会谁是证人
<14-52,BECKETT>You want to ask the mob who the witness is?

443
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,750
<14-53,CASTLE>他们显然知道他是谁
<14-53,CASTLE>Clearly, they already know who he is

444
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,980
<14-53,CASTLE>要不怎么追杀他
<14-53,CASTLE>If they're trying to kill him.

445
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,680
<14-53,CASTLE>正如你所言  他肯定是要案的
<14-53,CASTLE>Like you said, he's got to be a significant witness

446
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,950
<14-54,BECKETT>-重要证人  -那怎么做  跳上车
<14-54,BECKETT>- In a pretty big case. - So what do we do, hop in the car,

447
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,360
<14-54,BECKETT>直接开到巴达冰[电影《黑道家族》中脱衣舞俱乐部]
<14-54,BECKETT>Drive down to the bada bing?

448
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,770
<14-55,CASTLE>我认识个家伙  他欠我一个人情
<14-55,CASTLE>I know a guy. He owes me a favor.

449
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,470
<14-56,BECKETT>你"认识个家伙"  你以为这是梅特的戏吗
<14-56,BECKETT>You "know a guy"? What is this, a Mamet play?

450
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,130
<14-57,CASTLE>德里克·斯道姆年轻的时候
<14-57,CASTLE>From the early days of Derrick storm.

451
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,630
<14-57,CASTLE>他就是黑道家族的首领
<14-57,CASTLE>He's a capo with one of the families.

452
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,740
<14-57,CASTLE>-其实他人挺好的  -你在说犯罪分子
<14-57,CASTLE>- He's actually pretty nice. - For a criminal.

453
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,740
<14-59,CASTLE>我就是说  也许他知道什么呢
<14-59,CASTLE>I'm just saying, maybe he knows something.

454
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,420
<14-59,CASTLE>他的料连联邦探员都未必知道
<14-59,CASTLE>Maybe he can tell us something the feds won't.

455
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,890
<14-59,CASTLE>我总是忘记你常读戏剧
<14-59,CASTLE>I keep forgetting you read plays.

456
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,430
<15-1,CASTLE>我不是坏人  是朋友
<15-1,CASTLE>I'm-I'm a friend!

457
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,100
<15-1,CASTLE>是朋友  萨尔
<15-1,CASTLE>I'm a friend. Sal?

458
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,590
<15-2,SAL>从后面带出去  解决掉
<15-2,SAL>Take him out back. Kill him.

459
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,120
<15-3,CASTLE>萨尔  你不会
<15-3,CASTLE>Sal, whoa! Oh! Sal! Whoa, you're go-

<15-3,CASTLE>是我  哥们儿
<15-3,CASTLE>It's...it's me, buddy.

461
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,800
<15-4,SAL>等等  维托
<15-4,SAL>Vito! Vito, wait! Vito, wait!

462
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,290
<15-4,SAL>等等  就是给他个警告
<15-4,SAL>Hold up. I was just messing with him.

463
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,770
<15-4,SAL>抱歉  兄弟
<15-4,SAL>Sorry, man.

464
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,220
<15-5,CASTLE>萨尔  这可不好笑
<15-5,CASTLE>Not funny, Sal.

465
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,810
<15-6,SAL>说得对  不好笑
<15-6,SAL>Oh, you're right. No, it wasn't funny.

466
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,670
<15-6,SAL>是极度好笑
<15-6,SAL>It was frickin' hilarious!

467
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,320
<15-6,SAL>理查德·卡塞尔
<15-6,SAL>Richard frickin' Castle-

468
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,650
<15-6,SAL>恐怖大师
<15-6,SAL>Master of the macabre. Ha.

469
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,480
<15-6,SAL>什么风把你带来寒舍了
<15-6,SAL>What brings you down off your cloud of money?

470
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
<15-7,CASTLE>谢谢
<15-7,CASTLE>Thank you.

471
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,870
<15-8,SAL>你说的那家伙
<15-8,SAL>The guy you're talkin' about-

472
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,650
<15-8,SAL>在斯普拉诺家手下做事
<15-8,SAL>He worked for the Spolano family.

473
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,830
<15-8,SAL>老鼠吉米·莫然  是二当家
<15-8,SAL>Jimmy "the rat" Moran. He was an underboss.

474
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,310
<15-8,SAL>老头最器重他  但是
<15-8,SAL>He was a favorite of the old man's, but he got

475
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,000
<15-8,SAL>老头下台后  他被少爷排挤
<15-8,SAL>Squeezed out by junior when the old man bit it.

476
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,150
<15-8,SAL>传闻说几个月前他咸鱼翻身
<15-8,SAL>Rumor has it that he turned state's a few months ago,

477
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,350
<15-8,SAL>斯普拉诺家惊慌失措
<15-8,SAL>And the Spolanos are running scared.

478
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,920
<15-8,SAL>莫然似乎手握装载账单  日历
<15-8,SAL>Apparently, Moran's got it all- Bills of lading, calendars,

479
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,330
<15-8,SAL>账簿  什么都有
<15-8,SAL>Ledgers, the whole shooting match.

480
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,460
<15-8,SAL>足够把老大们都拉下水
<15-8,SAL>Enough to take down all the top guys.

481
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,590
<15-9,CASTLE>难怪他要改头换面
<15-9,CASTLE>Well, no wonder he wanted to change his face.

482
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,140
<15-10,SAL>不过  既然他们已经找到了医生
<15-10,SAL>Hey, if they got to the surgeon,

483
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,560
<15-10,SAL>找到他是早晚的问题
<15-10,SAL>It's only a matter of time before they get to him.

484
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,810
<15-11,CASTLE>-写《斯道姆之警告》时  -爱死那本书了
<15-11,CASTLE>- When I wrote "Storm Warning" - Oh, I love that book.

485
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,050
<15-12,SAL>谢谢
<15-12,SAL>Thank you.

486
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,180
<15-14,SAL>你说过某些职业杀手
<15-14,SAL>You told me that certain mob hit men

487
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,210
<15-15,CASTLE>-有标志性的杀人手法或武器  -没错
<15-15,CASTLE>- Have signature styles or weapons. - That's right.

488
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,280
<15-17,CASTLE>这个杀手用塑料袋和喉管胶布
<15-17,CASTLE>Okay, well, this killer used a plastic bag with duct tape

489
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,480
<15-17,CASTLE>使死者窒息而亡
<15-17,CASTLE>To suffocate his victim.

490
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,220
<15-17,CASTLE>听说过这样的杀手吗
<15-17,CASTLE>Does that sound like anyone you know?

491
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,480
<15-18,SAL>这点你得问斯普拉诺家的人了
<15-18,SAL>You'd have to ask the Spolanos about that one.

492
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,430
<15-19,CASTLE>不过我觉得他们不会说的
<15-19,CASTLE>Yeah, I don't think they'd like that.

493
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,070
<15-20,SAL>的确
<15-20,SAL>Heh. Probably not.

494
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,440
<15-20,SAL>-但你肯定认识其他知道答案的人  -谁
<15-20,SAL>- I bet you I know somebody else who might know. - Who?

495
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,110
<15-22,SAL>老鼠吉米
<15-22,SAL>Jimmy the rat.

496
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,440
<15-23,ESPOSITO>老鼠吉米·莫然  警方重点对象
<15-23,ESPOSITO>Jimmy "the rat" Moran, A.K.A. Jimmy pretty.

497
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,790
<15-23,ESPOSITO>他曾涉及赌博  放高利贷
<15-23,ESPOSITO>He's been linked to gambling, loan sharking

498
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,150
<15-23,ESPOSITO>以及勒索
<15-23,ESPOSITO>And extortion schemes.

499
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,670
<15-24,RYAN>想要手下忠诚
<15-24,RYAN>You know, you want a guy to be loyal,

500
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,530
<15-24,RYAN>就不该给他取老鼠这个绰号
<15-24,RYAN>You probably shouldn't nickname him "the rat."

501
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,390
<15-25,BECKETT>我们从斯普拉诺家族
<15-25,BECKETT>Okay, let's start off by digging up

502
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,190
<15-25,BECKETT>已知关系人着手调查
<15-25,BECKETT>All known associates of the Spolano family.

503
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,990
<15-26,RYAN>当然  查案时
<15-26,RYAN>Yeah, sure, and while we're at it,

504
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,280
<15-26,RYAN>我们直接拿头撞墙
<15-26,RYAN>We'll just bang our heads against a brick wall,

505
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,330
<15-26,RYAN>多好玩
<15-26,RYAN>You know, just for fun.

506
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,370
<15-27,ESPOSITO>职业杀手根本难以接近
<15-27,ESPOSITO>Professional hits are the hardest to close.

507
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,570
<15-27,ESPOSITO>因为凶手匿名
<15-27,ESPOSITO>Because of the anonymous nature of the murders, the usual rules

508
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,980
<15-27,ESPOSITO>从动机和关系着手并不起作用
<15-27,ESPOSITO>Like motive and relationship to victim don't apply.

509
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,930
<15-28,BECKETT>审问莫然  看他知道些什么
<15-28,BECKETT>We need to talk to Moran. Gotta see what he knows.

510
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,520
<15-29,ESPOSITO>何以确信"硬糖"朋友
<15-29,ESPOSITO>What makes you think your friend "hard candy"

511
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,750
<15-30,CASTLE>会和警方合作呢
<15-30,CASTLE>Is going to cooperate with you now?

512
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,110
<15-31,BECKETT>你有线人  我也有
<15-31,BECKETT>You have your sources. I have mine.

513
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,000
<15-32,CASTLE>是前任男友  对吗
<15-32,CASTLE>Oh, it's not your ex-boyfriend, is it?

514
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,300
<15-32,CASTLE>联邦探员  高大爱沉思  冲动武断
<15-32,CASTLE>Mr. FBI-Tall, brooding and judgmental?

515
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,220
<15-33,BECKETT>-算是事实  有问题吗  -我没问题
<15-33,BECKETT>- Why, yes, in fact, it is. Is that a problem? - No. Not for me.

516
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,840
<15-34,CASTLE>说起来  他又不是来找我复合
<15-34,CASTLE>But then again, I'm not the one He's trying to get back together with.

517
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,180
<16-1,WILL>真是美妙的惊喜
<16-1,WILL>Well, this is a nice surprise.

518
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,090
<16-2,BECKETT>是吗  希望这也是美妙的惊喜
<16-2,BECKETT>Yeah? Hopefully, this is a nice surprise as well.

519
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,800
<16-3,WILL>思缤客[著名蛋糕店]  我真的是一成不变
<16-3,WILL>Sprinkles. Am I really that predictable?

520
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,190

<16-4,BECKETT>Well, maybe I just know you too well.

521
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,120
<16-4,BECKETT>毕竟我们约会过
<16-4,BECKETT>I mean, we did date once.

522
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,570
<16-6,BECKETT>不  谢了  早不吃思缤客了
<16-6,BECKETT>Oh, no, thanks. I don't eat sprinkles anymore.

<16-7,WILL>凯特  你这样
<16-7,WILL>So, Kate, is this the part where you

525
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,740
<16-7,WILL>放弃原则  是有案子要我帮忙吗
<16-7,WILL>Ask me to bend the rules to help you on your case?

526
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,430
<16-8,BECKETT>我太一成不变了吗
<16-8,BECKETT>Am I really that predictable?

527
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,830
<16-9,WILL>我就是太了解你了
<16-9,WILL>Maybe I just know you too well.

<16-11,WILL>Jimmy Moran the mobster?

531
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,440
<16-13,WILL>为何觉得我能帮得了
<16-13,WILL>What makes you think I can help with that?

532
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,680
<16-14,BECKETT>联调局和司法部
<16-14,BECKETT>The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office

533
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,560
<16-15,WILL>-正对他进行证人保护  -你从何而知
<16-15,WILL>- Have him in witness protection. - And you know this how?

534
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,040
<16-16,BECKETT>流言蜚语
<16-16,BECKETT>Word on the street.

535
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,550
<16-17,WILL>就算是真的
<16-17,WILL>Look, even if it's true,

536
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,890
<16-17,WILL>有组织犯罪不在我的职责范围
<16-17,WILL>I don't work organized crime cases.

539
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,280
<16-18,BECKETT>他去找负责此案的司法部助理检察官
<16-18,BECKETT>He talks to the A.U.S.A. Running the case,

540
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,380
<16-19,WILL>-那我就能审吉米·莫然了  -我为何要帮你
<16-19,WILL>- And then I get to talk to Jimmy Moran. - And I do this for you why?

541
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,550
<16-20,BECKETT>那我这么说好了
<16-20,BECKETT>All right, let me put this another way.

542
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,250
<16-20,BECKETT>斯普拉诺家族已经知道
<16-20,BECKETT>The Spolanos know

543
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,740
<16-20,BECKETT>吉米在和警方合作
<16-20,BECKETT>That jimmy is cooperating with the government.

544
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,030
<16-20,BECKETT>我们知道他们在追杀他
<16-20,BECKETT>We know that they want him dead

545
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,370
<16-20,BECKETT>是因为他们杀了你们
<16-20,BECKETT>Because they murdered the surgeon

546
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,690
<16-20,BECKETT>雇来帮他整容的医生
<16-20,BECKETT>You feds hired to change his face.

547
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,600
<16-20,BECKETT>是你们让医生丧命黄泉
<16-20,BECKETT>You guys put that doctor in harm's way,

548
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
<16-20,BECKETT>你这么做只为他  而非我

<18-17,MORAN>我什么都告诉联调局了
<18-17,MORAN>Well, look, I already told the feds everything I know.

613
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,790
<18-17,MORAN>想要了解斯普拉诺家  问他们
<18-17,MORAN>You want info on the Spolanos, ask them.

614
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,570
<18-18,BECKETT>不过我们找你和斯普拉诺无关
<18-18,BECKETT>Actually, we're not here about the Spolanos.

615
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,160
<18-18,BECKETT>是关于帮你做手术的利兹医生
<18-18,BECKETT>We're here about Dr. Leeds, the man who operated on you.

616
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,220
<18-19,MORAN>他怎么了
<18-19,MORAN>What about him?

618
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,070
<18-21,MORAN>被杀  医生被杀

<18-22,CASTLE>头部被用塑料袋蒙住后  贴上喉管胶布
<18-22,CASTLE>They duct taped a plastic bag over his head.

621
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,530
<18-23,BECKETT>我们认为斯普拉诺可能与此有关
<18-23,BECKETT>We believe the Spolanos may have been involved.

622
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,300
<18-24,MORAN>可能
<18-24,MORAN>"May have been"?

623
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,500
<18-24,MORAN>可能
<18-24,MORAN>"May have been"?!

624
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,820
<18-25,BECKETT>鉴于利兹的死法
<18-25,BECKETT>Given how Leeds was killed

625
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,490
<18-25,BECKETT>以及你对组织知之甚多
<18-25,BECKETT>And given your knowledge of the organization,

630
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,530
<18-29,BECKETT>前提是你告诉我在斯普拉诺家族中
<18-29,BECKETT>But you have to let me know if there was anyone

631
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,990
<18-29,BECKETT>谁会这么杀人
<18-29,BECKETT>In the Spolano family that kills this way.

<18-30,MORAN>喉管胶布  塑料袋  正是我的办事手法
<18-30,MORAN>The duct tape, the bag- That was my M.O.

634
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,270
<18-30,MORAN>还不明白吗  他们是杀鸡儆猴
<18-30,MORAN>Don't you get it? They're sending a message to me,

635
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,580
<18-30,MORAN>他们连医生都找到了
<18-30,MORAN>And if they got to the doc...

636
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,540
<18-30,MORAN>带我回去  现在马上

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,200
<20-6,BECKETT>没什么好说的  是我促成这事的
<20-6,BECKETT>There's nothing to talk about. I'm the one who pushed for it,

658
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,040
<20-6,BECKETT>是我害威尔身陷险境
<20-6,BECKETT>And I'm the one who got will involved.

659
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,890
<20-7,CASTLE>你也不没料到会这样的
<20-7,CASTLE>There's no way you could have known this was gonna happen.

660
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,160
<20-8,BECKETT>你肯定吗
<20-8,BECKETT>Are you sure about that?

661
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,850
<20-8,BECKETT>-他们的车在我们见面后才遭攻击  -所以呢
<20-8,BECKETT>- Because their vehicle was attacked leaving our meet. - So?

662
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,200
<20-10,BECKETT>所以有人跟踪了我们
<20-10,BECKETT>So we were followed.

663
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,390
<20-10,BECKETT>知晓调查的人
<20-10,BECKETT>Someone who knew about the investigation

664
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,560
<20-10,BECKETT>发现了我们的见面
<20-10,BECKETT>Found out about the meet.

665
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,180
<20-10,BECKETT>我们把凶手带到莫然跟前  我本该知道的
<20-10,BECKETT>We led them to Moran. So yeah, I should've known.

666
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,650
<20-10,BECKETT>如果我是个好警察  我就应该知道
<20-10,BECKETT>And if I were a better cop, I would've.

667
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,450
<20-11,CASTLE>你责怪自己吗
<20-11,CASTLE>You think this is your fault?

668
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,370
<20-11,CASTLE>没错  是你促成会面
<20-11,CASTLE>Yeah, you pushed for it,

669
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,810
<20-11,CASTLE>但你这么做不是为工作  而是因为你在乎
<20-11,CASTLE>Not because it's your job, but because you care.

670
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,310
<20-11,CASTLE>多数人遇到拦路虎  会逃之夭夭
<20-11,CASTLE>Most people come up against a wall, they give up.

671
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,730
<20-11,CASTLE>你不会
<20-11,CASTLE>Not you.

673
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,530
<20-11,CASTLE>你不会退缩
<20-11,CASTLE>You don't back down.

674
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,970
<20-11,CASTLE>你可不是普通人
<20-11,CASTLE>That's what makes you extraordinary.

675
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,460
<20-12,RYAN>他会熬过去的  没事的
<20-12,RYAN>He's gonna make it. He's gonna be okay.

676
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,850
<21-1,OWEN>我

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,240
<21-6,ALEXIS>事实上  是的
<21-6,ALEXIS>As a matter of fact, I did.

683
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,740
<21-6,ALEXIS>约会挺美妙的
<21-6,ALEXIS>This dating thing is kind of nice.

684
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,700
<21-7,CASTLE>欧文怎么样
<21-7,CASTLE>How was Owen?

685
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,130
<21-7,CASTLE>别担心  你们接吻时我闭上眼睛了
<21-7,CASTLE>Don't worry. I closed my eyes for the kissing part.

686
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,660
<21-8,ALEXIS>我也是
<21-8,ALEXIS>Yeah, me, too.

687
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,680
<21-8,ALEXIS>其实你不需要等我的
<21-8,ALEXIS>You know you didn't have to wait up.

688
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,680
<21-9,CASTLE>分内事儿  等你是为保证你安全归来
<21-9,CASTLE>That's my job. I wait up. I make sure you're all right.

689
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,560
<21-9,CASTLE>但是今夜我意识到
<21-9,CASTLE>But tonight I realized

690
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,710
<21-9,CASTLE>这份工作我做不了多久了
<21-9,CASTLE>I'm not going to be doing it for much longer.

691
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,180
<21-11,CASTLE>-老爸  -过几年  你得离家念大学
<21-11,CASTLE>- Dad. - A couple years, you're gonna go off to college,

692
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,650
<21-11,CASTLE>然后结婚  生子
<21-11,CASTLE>You're gonna get married, you're gonna have kids,

693
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,920
<21-11,CASTLE>只有假期才能见面了
<21-11,CASTLE>And I'm only gonna see you on holidays.

694
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,900
<21-11,CASTLE>除非有小贼偷光我的财产
<21-11,CASTLE>Until some gold digger steals all my money,

695
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,610
<21-11,CASTLE>我才能搬去和你同住
<21-11,CASTLE>But then I get to move in with you.

696
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,080
<21-12,ALEXIS>怎么觉得一下过去了三十年
<21-12,ALEXIS>Wow. I feel like I just lost 30 years of my life.

697
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,960
<21-13,CASTLE>生活就是这样
<21-13,CASTLE>That's how it happens.

698
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,660
<21-13,CASTLE>头一天你还穿芭蕾舞短裙  第二天
<21-13,CASTLE>One day you're in tutus, and the next day you're...

699
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,430
<21-13,CASTLE>我都见过你男朋友了
<21-13,CASTLE>Too old for severed heads.

700
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,130
<21-14,ALEXIS>爸爸  别担心
<21-14,ALEXIS>Dad, don't worry.

701
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,180
<21-14,ALEXIS>不管我会有多老
<21-14,ALEXIS>No matter how old I get,

702
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,430
<21-14,ALEXIS>永远都是你的小小女儿
<21-14,ALEXIS>I'll always be your little girl.

703
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,850
<21-15,CASTLE>发誓
<21-15,CASTLE>Promise?

704
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,130
<21-15,CASTLE>发誓
<21-15,CASTLE>Promise.

705
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,820
<21-17,CASTLE>谢谢
<21-17,CASTLE>Thank you.

706
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,450
<21-18,ALEXIS>去睡觉吧
<21-18,ALEXIS>Now go to bed.

707
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,170
<21-18,ALEXIS>好
<21-18,ALEXIS>Okay.

708
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,680
<22-1,RYAN>值班同事说她早上四点就来了
<22-1,RYAN>Desk officer said she came in at 4:00 this morning.

709
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,510
<22-1,RYAN>然后一直在白板前忙活
<22-1,RYAN>She's been at the board ever since.

710
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,590
<22-2,ESPOSITO>早上六点给我们打电话
<22-2,ESPOSITO>She called us in at 6:00 A.M.

711
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,220
<22-2,ESPOSITO>重新确认已调查的所有涉案人员
<22-2,ESPOSITO>To recheck every person we talked to on the case.

712
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,540
<22-3,RYAN>喝了九杯双份浓缩咖啡[一般为男性饮料]
<22-3,RYAN>And she's had, like, nine double espressos.

713
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,610
<22-4,CASTLE>早上好  一直在网上
<22-4,CASTLE>Hey. Been reading on the internet

714
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,390
<22-4,CASTLE>看关于"睡觉"这个新事物
<22-4,CASTLE>About this new thing called "sleep."

715
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,000
<22-4,CASTLE>睡觉对你会有好处的
<22-4,CASTLE>Supposed to be real good for ya.

716
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,750
<22-6,CASTLE>昨晚我对你说的那番话
<22-6,CASTLE>When I gave you that little speech last night,

717
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,590
<22-6,CASTLE>可不是让你
<22-6,CASTLE>I really didn't mean for you

718
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,520
<22-6,CASTLE>模仿《美丽心灵》
<22-6,CASTLE>To go all "Beautiful Mind" on me.

719
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,030
<22-7,BECKETT>肯定不是司法部的人
<22-7,BECKETT>It wasn't anyone at the U.S. Attorney's office.

720
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,450
<22-7,BECKETT>他们无需通过我们来找到目标
<22-7,BECKETT>They wouldn't need us to find him.

721
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,550
<22-7,BECKETT>那就是我们审问过的人
<22-7,BECKETT>So it had to be someone that we talked to.

722
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,270
<22-8,CASTLE>不是因为我找的黑道吗
<22-8,CASTLE>You don't think it was my mafia connection?

723
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,050
<22-9,BECKETT>如果他属于那伙人
<22-9,BECKETT>If he's in a rival family,

724
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,890
<22-9,BECKETT>他们会希望莫然活着作证
<22-9,BECKETT>Then they would want Moran alive to testify

725
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,670
<22-9,BECKETT>因为如果联调局打垮斯普拉诺家族
<22-9,BECKETT>Because if the feds take down the Spolanos,

726
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,680
<22-9,BECKETT>其他人就能瓜分他们的地盘
<22-9,BECKETT>Then the other families can take over their territories.

727
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,040
<22-9,BECKETT>我们要找的人  在我们介入前
<22-9,BECKETT>No, we are looking for someone who had access

728
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,240
<22-9,BECKETT>就能接触到医生
<22-9,BECKETT>To the doctor before we got the case.

729
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,910
<22-10,CASTLE>那就是死者的未婚妻和员工
<22-10,CASTLE>So that leaves the fiance and his staff.

730
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,100
<22-11,RYAN>不过未婚妻没有嫌疑
<22-11,RYAN>Yeah, except the fiance is clean,

731
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,320
<22-11,RYAN>昨晚有不在场证明
<22-11,RYAN>Alibied and accounted for last night.

732
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,490
<22-11,RYAN>电话记录显示她未和未知号码通话
<22-11,RYAN>Phone records don't indicate any calls to unknown numbers.

733
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,340
<22-12,CASTLE>我想你们肯定也查过职员了
<22-12,CASTLE>I thought you already ran his staff up.

734
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,130
<22-13,ESPOSITO>的确  没有任何记录
<22-13,ESPOSITO>We did, and there were no records of anything

735
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,970
<22-13,ESPOSITO>-显示他们和犯罪团伙有关   -昨晚呢
<22-13,ESPOSITO>- That indicate ties to organized crime. - What about last night?

736
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,930
<22-15,ESPOSITO>玛姬·道地和朋友聚餐
<22-15,ESPOSITO>Maggie Dowd was at dinner with friends.

737
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,680
<22-15,ESPOSITO>马力欧·格雷罗加班整理病人资料
<22-15,ESPOSITO>Mario Guerrero worked late packing patient files,

738
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,950
<22-15,ESPOSITO>护士长茱莉亚·哈蒙德
<22-15,ESPOSITO>And the senior nurse, Julia Hammond,

739
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,080
<22-15,ESPOSITO>说她独自一人在家
<22-15,ESPOSITO>Claims she was home alone.

740
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,220
<22-16,BECKETT>马力欧为什么要整理病人资料
<22-16,BECKETT>What was Mario doing packing patient files last night?

741
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,520
<22-17,ESPOSITO>诊所要关门  病人资料要转给
<22-17,ESPOSITO>They're closing up shop. Patient files are all going

742
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,810
<22-18,BECKETT>-新医生  -周五晚上整理资料
<22-18,BECKETT>- To new doctors. - It's just, doesn't that seem like a weird thing

743
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,920
<22-19,RYAN>-不觉得怪异吗  -底层人民的生活
<22-19,RYAN>- To be doing on a Friday night? - Yeah, well, when you're low man on the totem pole,

744
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,030
<22-19,RYAN>就是这样  领导觉得
<22-19,RYAN>That's what life is like. People think they can

745
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,500
<22-19,RYAN>周六早上六点也能打电话叫你工作
<22-19,RYAN>Call you in to work at 6:00 A.M. On a Saturday.

746
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,970
<22-20,BECKETT>茱莉亚·哈蒙德和玛姬·道地
<22-20,BECKETT>Julia Hammond and Maggie Dowd-

747
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,100
<22-20,BECKETT>在利兹医生手下做多久了
<22-20,BECKETT>How long did they work for Dr. Leeds?

748
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,770
<22-21,ESPOSITO>哈蒙德跟他十年了
<22-21,ESPOSITO>Uh, Hammond was with him ten years.

749
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,560
<22-21,ESPOSITO>-玛姬是几个月前来的  -怎么了
<22-21,ESPOSITO>- Maggie came on a few months back. - Why?

750
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,420
<22-22,BECKETT>因为我们的底层人民马力欧·格雷罗
<22-22,BECKETT>Because our low man on the totem pole Mario Guerrero

751
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,080
<22-22,BECKETT>一个月前才跟的利兹医生
<22-22,BECKETT>Started working for the doctor about a month ago.

752
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,350
<22-23,RYAN>查过他了  还打电话给护校了
<22-23,RYAN>We checked him. We even called his nursing school.

753
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,910
<22-24,BECKETT>-他没问题  -再查一遍  不可能都没问题
<22-24,BECKETT>- He's clean. - Check again. They can't all be clean.

754
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,630
<22-25,CASTLE>去哪里
<22-25,CASTLE>Where are you going?

755
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,770
<22-26,BECKETT>看看周五晚马力欧是否真在办公室
<22-26,BECKETT>To see if Mario was actually at the office Friday night.

756
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,840
<23-1,JULIA>探长
<23-1,JULIA>Detective.

757
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,110
<23-2,BECKETT>-出什么事了  -马力欧  跟我走一趟
<23-2,BECKETT>- Is everything okay? - Mario, I need you to come with me.

758
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,250
<23-4,BECKETT>-为什么  -警方有问题要问你
<23-4,BECKETT>- Why? - We need to ask you some questions.

759
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,970
<23-5,MARIO>我做错了什么

<23-9,ESPOSITO>而且又给护校打了电话
<23-9,ESPOSITO>Even called the nursing schools again.

763
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,070
<23-9,ESPOSITO>这次我们让校方发了照片
<23-9,ESPOSITO>This time we had 'em send pictures,

<23-11,JULIA>-是玛姬  玛姬·道地人呢  -她今天没来  怎么了
<23-11,JULIA>- It's Maggie. Where's Maggie Dowd? - She didn't come in today. Why?

767
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,660
<23-12,CASTLE>探长
<23-12,CASTLE>Detective?

768
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,210
<23-13,BECKETT>利兹医生隶属于圣马革士医院吗
<23-13,BECKETT>Is Dr. Leeds affiliated with st. Marcus hospital?

769
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,280
<23-14,JULIA>-对  在那边办手续  -如果她找到医院
<23-14,JULIA>- Yeah. That's where we do our procedures. - If she has a hospital I.D.-

770
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,120
<23-16,BECKETT>-就能达到目的   -你没事了
<23-16,BECKETT>- She can finish the job. - You're off the hook...

771
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,560
<23-17,CASTLE>但别出城
<23-17,CASTLE>But don't leave town.

772
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,900
<23-18,GUARD>这间病房限制进入  请出示身份证
<23-18,GUARD>Oh. Room's restricted. Need to see your I.D.

773
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,160
<23-20,GUARD>-好的  -名单上有玛姬·道地吗
<23-20,GUARD>- Sure. - You have a Maggie Dowd on your list?

774
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,520
<23-21,FEMALE GUARD>在花名册上  让她进来
<23-21,FEMALE GUARD>She's on the roster. You can let her through.

775
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,100
<23-22,MAGGIE>吉米  你可真难找
<23-22,MAGGIE>I gotta say, jimmy, you're a hard man to find.

776
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,970
<23-22,MAGGIE>我花了好几周才发现你整容了
<23-22,MAGGIE>Took me weeks to even find out that you changed your face.

777
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,840
<23-22,MAGGIE>硫喷妥钠  注射死刑用药
<23-22,MAGGIE>Sodium thiopental. It's what they use in lethal injections.

778
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,070
<23-22,MAGGIE>倒是没有塑料袋那么有意思
<23-22,MAGGIE>It's not as much fun as a plastic bag...

779
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,430
<23-22,MAGGIE>但效果相同
<23-22,MAGGIE>But it does the trick.

780
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,730
<23-22,MAGGIE>少爷有话要我转告
<23-22,MAGGIE>Oh, and, uh, I got a message from junior, jimmy.

781
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,680
<23-22,MAGGIE>他说
<23-22,MAGGIE>He says,

782
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,450
<23-22,MAGGIE>去死吧
<23-22,MAGGIE>"Go to hell."

783
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,620
<23-23,BECKETT>你好
<23-23,BECKETT>Hi.

784
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,260
<23-23,BECKETT>你因谋杀利兹医生
<23-23,BECKETT>You're under arrest for the murder of Dr. Leeds

785
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,790
<23-23,BECKETT>-以及谋杀吉米·莫然未遂被捕  -太迟了
<23-23,BECKETT>- And the attempted murder of Jimmy Moran. - You're too late.

786
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,010
<23-24,MAGGIE>天哪
<23-24,MAGGIE>Oh, no. Oh, god.

787
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,210
<23-25,CASTLE>没事  没连着的
<23-25,CASTLE>Oh, don't worry. It's not attached to anything.

788
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,910
<23-25,CASTLE>怎么好像我们知道你要来
<23-25,CASTLE>It's like we knew you were coming.

789
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,790
<23-26,BECKETT>谋杀联邦证人未遂
<23-26,BECKETT>Attempted murder of a federal witness-

790
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,940
<23-26,BECKETT>-现在怎么判刑  -25年到终生监禁
<23-26,BECKETT>- What's that going for these days? - 25 to life.

791
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:49,950
<24-1,BECKETT>交给你了
<24-1,BECKETT>She's all yours.

792
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,560
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>似乎学会了如何
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>Looks like you managed to set things right with

793
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,470
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>同司法部合作
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>The U.S. Attorney's office.

794
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,390
<24-3,BECKETT>她现在是联邦证人  等莫然康复
<24-3,BECKETT>She turned state's. When Moran recovers,

795
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,470
<24-3,BECKETT>联调局就有两名证人指正斯普拉诺家族
<24-3,BECKETT>The feds will have two witnesses against the Spolanos.

796
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,290
<24-4,MONTGOMERY>不过玛姬能指证他们谋杀
<24-4,MONTGOMERY>But only Maggie back there can link them to murder.

797
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,110
<24-5,BECKETT>她的真名叫做卡拉·但丁
<24-5,BECKETT>Oh, but her real name is Carla Dante.

798
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,860
<24-5,BECKETT>他们叫她冷血卡拉
<24-5,BECKETT>They call her "Carla Coldblood."

799
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,720
<24-5,BECKETT>她为他们当了五年杀手
<24-5,BECKETT>She's been killing for the family for five years now.

800
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,260
<24-5,BECKETT>吉米和警方合作后
<24-5,BECKETT>When jimmy dropped dime,

801
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,550
<24-5,BECKETT>斯普拉诺派出了最好的杀手
<24-5,BECKETT>The Spolanos sent their best.

802
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,340
<24-6,MONTGOMERY>女杀手  真会打击到女权
<24-6,MONTGOMERY>Lady hit man-A real blow for women's rights.

803
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,840
<24-6,MONTGOMERY>真正的玛姬·道地呢
<24-6,MONTGOMERY>And the real Maggie Dowd?

804
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,350
<24-7,BECKETT>在西雅图一家医院工作
<24-7,BECKETT>Works for a hospital in Seattle.

805
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,100
<24-7,BECKETT>不知道自己身份被盗用
<24-7,BECKETT>She had no idea that they had stolen her identity.

806
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,550
<24-7,BECKETT>卡拉甚至成功地
<24-7,BECKETT>Carla even pulled a recommendation

807
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,900
<24-7,BECKETT>从求职网站拿到推荐信
<24-7,BECKETT>Off of a job-Hunting site

808
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,000
<24-7,BECKETT>才申请了利兹医生手下的职位
<24-7,BECKETT>In order to apply for the position with Leeds.

809
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,600
<24-7,BECKETT>起初想找到莫然的照片
<24-7,BECKETT>Originally she thought she was gonna get a photograph of Moran,

810
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,060
<24-7,BECKETT>没拿到  就对利兹医生下手了
<24-7,BECKETT>And when she couldn't, she went after Leeds.

811
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,520
<24-8,MONTGOMERY>但利兹医生不合作 于是杀了他
<24-8,MONTGOMERY>And then when Leeds didn't talk, she killed him.

812
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,350
<24-8,MONTGOMERY>但为何还留下不走
<24-8,MONTGOMERY>But why stay around the office?

813
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,190
<24-9,BECKETT>如果在利兹医生尸首被发现前就走
<24-9,BECKETT>If she left before Leeds' body was found,

814
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,340
<24-9,BECKETT>自己就有嫌疑了  而且她可能没料到
<24-9,BECKETT>It would have looked suspicious, and she probably didn't think

815
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,030
<24-9,BECKETT>尸体一周后才被发现
<24-9,BECKETT>He'd be sitting around for a week.

816
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,670
<24-9,BECKETT>我们出现后  她想知道
<24-9,BECKETT>Then we showed up, and she waited to see

817
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,640
<24-9,BECKETT>我们的进度
<24-9,BECKETT>How far we'd get.

818
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,580
<24-10,MONTGOMERY>做的好  探长  非常好
<24-10,MONTGOMERY>That's good work, detective. Very good work.

819
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,000
<24-11,BECKETT>谢谢长官  我从未想过
<24-11,BECKETT>Thank you, sir. You know, sir, I never thought

820
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,330
<24-11,BECKETT>自己会说这番话  不过
<24-11,BECKETT>That I would be saying this, but...

821
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,060
<24-11,BECKETT>没有卡塞尔  我破不了案
<24-11,BECKETT>I don't think I could have done it without Castle.

822
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,130
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>那卡塞尔人呢
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>Where is Castle, anyway?

823
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,810
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>原来的法医定性为随机案件
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>The original M.E. concluded that the stab wounds were random.

824
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,790
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>但也许是凶手走运  你看此处刀伤
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>Now maybe the killer got lucky, but you see this wound here?

825
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,590
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>低角度对准肾脏
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>It's a low-angle thrust to the kidney.

826
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,880
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>伤口尺寸显示刀子是有角度的
<24-12,MONTGOMERY>The wound size indicated that the knife was twisted.

827
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,510
<25-1,CASTLE>死者当时就休克了
<25-1,CASTLE>Her body would have gone into immediate shock.

828
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,140
<25-2,CASTLE>这些呢
<25-2,CASTLE>What about these?

829
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,050
<25-2,CASTLE>这些角度显示伤口是在死者
<25-2,CASTLE>Well, their angles indicate that they were delivered

830
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,800
<25-2,CASTLE>在地上不动时造成的
<25-2,CASTLE>After she was immobilized and on the ground.

831
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:19,050
<25-3,CASTLE>只是幌子
<25-3,CASTLE>They're just for show.

832
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,210
<25-3,CASTLE>这刀是致命伤
<25-3,CASTLE>This is the one that killed her.

833
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,720
<25-3,CASTLE>这听着不像意外
<25-3,CASTLE>This is sounding less like a random killing,

834
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,790
<25-3,CASTLE>而像蓄意谋杀
<25-3,CASTLE>More like a targeted murder.

835
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,980
<25-3,CASTLE>还有呢
<25-3,CASTLE>There's more.

836
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,280
<25-3,CASTLE>凭直觉  我查了这位法医的其他资料
<25-3,CASTLE>On a hunch, I checked the city M.E. Files

837
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,750
<25-4,CASTLE>求证此案是否是独立的
<25-4,CASTLE>To see if this was an isolated incident

838
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,720
<25-4,CASTLE>发现当时有三起持刀杀人案
<25-4,CASTLE>And found three other stabbings around that time

839
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,640
<25-4,CASTLE>都被这位法医判为随机案件
<25-4,CASTLE>That the M.E. Working the case dismissed as... Random.

840
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,530
<25-4,CASTLE>有关联吗
<25-4,CASTLE>Were they related?

841
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,830
<25-4,CASTLE>你真想知道吗
<25-4,CASTLE>Are you sure you want to know?

842
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,010
<25-5,MARTHA>你得告诉她
<25-5,MARTHA>You have to tell her, you know.

843
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,100
<25-6,CASTLE>你知道她听到会怎样吗
<25-6,CASTLE>Do you know what this would do to her?

844
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,880
<25-7,MARTHA>你有了关于她母亲被杀的新情况
<25-7,MARTHA>You have information that could lead to her mother's killer.

845
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,410
<25-7,MARTHA>-不能不告诉她  -我知道
<25-7,MARTHA>- You can't keep that from her. - I know.

846
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,850
<25-8,CASTLE>可她说如果我调查此案  我们就结束了
<25-8,CASTLE>But she said if I opened the file, that we'd be through.

847
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,740
<25-9,MARTHA>有什么关系
<25-9,MARTHA>It doesn't matter.

849
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,560
<26-1,WILL>别这样
<26-1,WILL>No, you didn't.

850
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,860
<26-1,WILL>别让我发笑了
<26-1,WILL>Stop making me laugh.

851
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,960
<26-2,BECKETT>得了  你又不是中枪
<26-2,BECKETT>Oh, come on. It's not like you've been shot or something.

852
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,660
<26-3,WILL>我以为你不再吃思缤客了
<26-3,WILL>I thought you were over sprinkles.

853
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,210
<26-4,BECKETT>也许还没
<26-4,BECKETT>Maybe not.

854
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,790
<26-5,WILL>是那个作家猴子
<26-5,WILL>It's the writer monkey.

855
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,970
<26-6,WILL>他还在这里干嘛
<26-6,WILL>What is he still doing here?

856
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,780
<26-6,WILL>书还没写好吗
<26-6,WILL>Haven't you finished your book yet?

857
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,960
<26-7,CASTLE>最后一张
<26-7,CASTLE>Last chapter.

858
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,230
<26-7,CASTLE>能说句话吗
<26-7,CASTLE>Do you have a sec?

859
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,870
<26-9,WILL>当心  凯特  他喜欢你
<26-9,WILL>Watch it, Kate. He likes you.

860
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,560
<26-10,BECKETT>你得原谅他  药吃多了
<26-10,BECKETT>You'll have to forgive him. He is heavily medicated.

861
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,230
<26-11,BECKETT>怎么这么严肃  没事吧
<26-11,BECKETT>You look awfully serious. Is everything okay?

862
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,850
<26-12,CASTLE>坐下
<26-12,CASTLE>Take a seat.

863
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,830
<26-13,BECKETT>怎么了
<26-13,BECKETT>What?

864
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,270
<26-14,CASTLE>坐下
<26-14,CASTLE>Sit down.

865
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,920
<26-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  怎么了
<26-15,BECKETT>Castle, what's going on?

866
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,530
<26-16,CASTLE>是关于你母亲的
<26-16,CASTLE>It's about your mother.
