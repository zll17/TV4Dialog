7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,720
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>你居然下厨
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>You're cooking.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,610
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>我肯定在做梦  有可能是
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>This must be a dream or perhaps

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,650
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>噩梦
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>a nightmare.

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,070
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我心胸宽广
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>I choose to take the higher ground

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,250
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>不跟你计较
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>and ignore that.

12
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,800
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>早餐好了
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Breakfast is served.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,810
<1-3,CASTLE>这是我专为阿丽克西斯准备的
<1-3,CASTLE>These are my patented special pancakes

14
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,340
<1-3,CASTLE>特别煎饼
<1-3,CASTLE>ahat I make for Alexis.

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,680
<1-4,MARTHA>也没那么特别
<1-4,MARTHA>Well, not so special.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,620
<1-4,MARTHA>过去这些年我也学会了怎么做
<1-4,MARTHA>I learned how to prepare it for her this past year.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,430
<1-5,CASTLE>学生变成了
<1-5,CASTLE>so the student becomes...

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,680
<1-5,CASTLE>不及格的学生
<1-5,CASTLE>the failed student,

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,070
<1-5,CASTLE>辍学生
<1-5,CASTLE>the dropout.

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,960
<1-5,CASTLE>你给她吃过吗  妈
<1-5,CASTLE>You fed her this? Mother...

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,590
<1-5,CASTLE>您老人家永远不要
<1-5,CASTLE>You are forever forbidden

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,140
<1-5,CASTLE>再拿煎饼练手了
<1-5,CASTLE>from practicing the art of pan-cake-do.

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,300
<1-6,MARTHA>我哪里做错了
<1-6,MARTHA>Where did I go wrong?

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,480
<1-7,CASTLE>叫我从何说起
<1-7,CASTLE>Where do I begin?

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,730
<1-7,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯不在家  你怎么要做这个
<1-7,CASTLE>But Alexis isn't even here. Why are you making these?

26
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,120
<1-8,CASTLE>你想她了
<1-8,CASTLE>You miss her.

27
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,460
<1-9,MARTHA>你不想吗
<1-9,MARTHA>Well, don't you?

28
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,750
<1-10,CASTLE>我当然想了
<1-10,CASTLE>Yes, of course I do.

29
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,370
<1-10,CASTLE>可是坐计程车就能到哥伦比亚大学
<1-10,CASTLE>But Columbia's just a cab ride away.

30
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,320
<1-11,MARTHA>这么多年来她都是我们生活的重心
<1-11,MARTHA>Oh, she was the center of our lives for so long,

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,110
<1-11,MARTHA>现在她就这样  走了
<1-11,MARTHA>And now she's just... Gone?

32
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,170
<1-12,CASTLE>现在是让阿丽克西斯
<1-12,CASTLE>Right now is just Alexis' time

33
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,190
<1-12,CASTLE>过自己的生活的时候了
<1-12,CASTLE>to make her own way in the world.

34
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,940
<1-12,CASTLE>但她会回来的
<1-12,CASTLE>But she'll be back.

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,580
<1-12,CASTLE>就像《狮子王》里的辛巴一样
<1-12,CASTLE>Like Simba in "The Lion King,"

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,320
<1-12,CASTLE>这是生命的循环
<1-12,CASTLE>it's the circle of life.

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,250
<1-13,MARTHA>亲爱的
<1-13,MARTHA>Oh, darling.

38
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,480
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>你对这件事似乎
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>you seem to have adopted

39
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,210
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>有了禅的顿悟啊  卡塞尔
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>a real zen-like attitude about all this, Castle.

40
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,000
<2-2,CASTLE>我意识到自己偶尔对阿丽克西斯
<2-2,CASTLE>Well, I realized I've been a little overprotective

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,410
<2-2,CASTLE>有点保护过度
<2-2,CASTLE>of Alexis at times.

42
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,040
<2-2,CASTLE>好吧  经常如此
<2-2,CASTLE>Okay, constantly.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,300
<2-2,CASTLE>但自从她上哥伦比亚大学后
<2-2,CASTLE>But since she's left for Columbia,

44
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,130
<2-2,CASTLE>我学会了放手
<2-2,CASTLE>I've learned to let go.

45
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,120
<2-2,CASTLE>我不再去看她的视频博客
<2-2,CASTLE>I've stopped checking her video blog.

46
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,740
<2-2,CASTLE>不再要求见她的男朋友
<2-2,CASTLE>I don't ask to meet her boyfriend anymore.

47
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,700
<2-2,CASTLE>我开始意识到就像小鸟一样
<2-2,CASTLE>I've come to realize that, like a bird,

48
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,200
<2-2,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯需要离巢
<2-2,CASTLE>Alexis needed to leave the nest.

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,910
<2-2,CASTLE>所以我让她高飞
<2-2,CASTLE>So I let her fly...

50
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,720
<2-2,CASTLE>我转过身潇洒地大步离开
<2-2,CASTLE>I turned around and I strode away.

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,830
<2-2,CASTLE>这叫做接受现实
<2-2,CASTLE>That's acceptance.

52
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,760
<2-3,BECKETT>让她高飞  知道她往哪飞
<2-3,BECKETT>But wouldn't acceptance be letting her go,

53
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,470
<2-3,BECKETT>并且能够接受  这才叫真的接受吧
<2-3,BECKETT>seeing where she flies, and then being okay with it?

54
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,430
<2-4,CASTLE>那我可受不了
<2-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but I wouldn't be okay with that.

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,810
<2-4,CASTLE>我不想知道她飞到哪里了
<2-4,CASTLE>I don't want to see where she goes,

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,030
<2-4,CASTLE>外面有些什么样的猛禽
<2-4,CASTLE>What other birds of prey are out there

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,220
<2-4,CASTLE>其它的鸟巢...
<2-4,CASTLE>and what other nests are--

58
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,100
<2-5,BECKETT>你这到底是接受还是拒绝接受
<2-5,BECKETT>So is that acceptance or denial?

59
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,070
<2-6,CASTLE>本来接受的
<2-6,CASTLE>Well, it was acceptance

60
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,010
<2-6,CASTLE>直到你搬出这套残酷的逻辑
<2-6,CASTLE>till you started applying your fiendish logic.

61
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,590
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>不如你们把残酷的逻辑运用到这里吧
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>How about you guys apply some fiendish logic to this?

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,130
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>这是哈希姆·法鲁克
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>Meet Hasim Farouk.

63
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,870
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>昨晚一点被货车撞上
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>Man versus van at 1:00 a.m. last night.

64
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,350
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>当场死亡
<2-7,LANIE PARISH>He was killed instantly.

65
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,500
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>撞车时鞋子被甩了出去
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Knocked right out of his shoes at the point of impact.

66
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,790
<2-9,BECKETT>撞人逃逸吗
<2-9,BECKETT>So a hit and run.

67
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,340
<2-10,ESPOSITO>这只是冰山一角
<2-10,ESPOSITO>Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg.

68
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,230
<2-10,ESPOSITO>据目击证人  一个流浪汉说
<2-10,ESPOSITO>A witness, homeless guy, said that

69
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,550
<2-10,ESPOSITO>被害人一直站在街中央
<2-10,ESPOSITO>the victim emptied his gun at the van

70
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,270
<2-10,ESPOSITO>对着货车射击
<2-10,ESPOSITO>and just stood in the middle of the street shooting

71
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,260
<2-10,ESPOSITO>然后被货车撞上
<2-10,ESPOSITO>right until it hit him.

72
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,000
<2-11,CASTLE>他为什么这样做
<2-11,CASTLE>Why would he do that?

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,560
<2-11,CASTLE>我不知道
<2-11,CASTLE>I don't know.

74
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,440
<2-12,ESPOSITO>但他对用枪很在行  小詹
<2-12,ESPOSITO>But he definitely knew his way around guns. Jan.

75
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,100
<2-12,ESPOSITO>这是西格P220S手枪
<2-12,ESPOSITO>This is a sig p-220-s

76
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,540
<2-12,ESPOSITO>上面有重量校正器
<2-12,ESPOSITO>with a weight compensator,

77
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,290
<2-12,ESPOSITO>瞄准器  定制枪把
<2-12,ESPOSITO>target sights, and a custom-molded grip to his hand.

78
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,630
<2-12,ESPOSITO>他是非常专业的枪手
<2-12,ESPOSITO>This was a serious shooter.

79
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,910
<2-13,BECKETT>对他还有什么了解
<2-13,BECKETT>What else do we know about him?

80
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,940
<2-14,KEVIN RYAN>哈希姆·法鲁克是沙特阿拉伯人
<2-14,KEVIN RYAN>Well, Hasim Farouk is a Saudi national

81
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,110
<2-14,KEVIN RYAN>他是在校学生
<2-14,KEVIN RYAN>living here as a student.

82
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,970
<2-15,CASTLE>专业是什么  都市战争吗
<2-15,CASTLE>Majoring in what, urban warfare?

83

<2-16,RYAN>哥伦比亚大学  未申报专业
<2-16,RYAN>Uh, undeclared, actually, up at columbia.

84
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,980
<2-17,BECKETT>他在曼哈顿下城区做什么
<2-17,BECKETT>So what was he doing in lower manhattan?

85
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,250
<2-18,CASTLE>更重要的是
<2-18,CASTLE>More importantly...

86
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,350
<2-18,CASTLE>哥伦比亚大学
<2-18,CASTLE>what is Columbia doing

87
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,000
<2-18,CASTLE>怎么会收这种持枪行凶的疯子
<2-18,CASTLE>admitting gun-toting lunatics

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,620
<2-18,CASTLE>还有这样的人吗
<2-18,CASTLE>and are there any more of them?

89
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,130
<2-18,CASTLE>说清楚一下  我不是打给阿丽克西斯
<2-18,CASTLE>For the record, I'm not calling to check on Alexis.

90
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,610
<2-18,CASTLE>我只是在收邮件
<2-18,CASTLE>I'm just checking my e-mail.

91
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,450
<2-19,CASTLE>接受现实
<2-19,CASTLE>Acceptance.

92
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,660
<2-20,BECKETT>叫技术人员查看交通监控带
<2-20,BECKETT>Have tech search traffic cam footage

93
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,840
<2-20,BECKETT>找到这辆货车的视频
<2-20,BECKETT>for any video of that van,

94
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
<2-20,BECKETT>调查哈希姆·法鲁克的背景
<2-20,BECKETT>and let's look into Hasim Farouk's life.

95
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,150
<2-20,BECKETT>看看他有没有敌人
<2-20,BECKETT>See if he had any enemies.

96
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,090
<2-21,RYAN>看起来他似乎至少有一个敌人
<2-21,RYAN>Well, it looks like he had at least one.

97
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,180
<2-21,RYAN>两天前有人起诉他人身攻击
<2-21,RYAN>Assault charges were filed against him two days ago

98
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,680
<2-21,RYAN>起诉人是布莱姆·斯托克
<2-21,RYAN>by one Bram Stoker.

99
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,400
<2-22,CASTLE>布莱姆·斯托克  《德古拉》的作者  1912年去世
<2-22,CASTLE>Bram Stoker, author of "Dracula," died in 1912?

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,140
<2-23,RYAN>如果是他的话  我只能说他是永生的
<2-23,RYAN>Uh, if it's him, I'd say he's immortal.

101
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,290
<3-1,BECKETT>打扰下  布莱姆·斯托克
<3-1,BECKETT>Excuse me. Bram Stoker?

102
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:24,900
<3-2,BRAM STOKER>什么事
<3-2,BRAM STOKER>Yeah.

103
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,580
<3-3,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特探长  纽约警局
<3-3,BECKETT>Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

104
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,980
<3-4,CASTLE>请容我说句  你看起来真年轻
<3-4,CASTLE>And might I say how youthful you look?

105
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,000
<3-5,BRAM>真会说俏皮话  没人这样说过
<3-5,BRAM>Witty. Never heard that before.

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,980
<3-6,CASTLE>我以前从未听说有人叫布莱姆·斯托克
<3-6,CASTLE>I've never heard of anyone named Bram Stoker before

107
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,650
<3-6,CASTLE>除了布莱姆·斯托克本人
<3-6,CASTLE>except Bram Stoker .

108
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,160
<3-7,BRAM>显然  他是我家的远亲
<3-7,BRAM>Apparently, he's a distant relative,

109
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,490
<3-7,BRAM>我父母都是英国学者
<3-7,BRAM>and both my parents are english scholars.

110
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,650
<3-7,BRAM>他们觉得起这名字很可爱
<3-7,BRAM>They thought it'd be cute.

111
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
<3-7,BRAM>一点不可爱
<3-7,BRAM>It wasn't.

112
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,920
<3-7,BRAM>什么事
<3-7,BRAM>So what is this about?

113
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,430
<3-8,BECKETT>已故的哈希姆·法鲁克
<3-8,BECKETT>The late Hasim Farouk.

114
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,560
<3-8,BECKETT>已故的
<3-8,BECKETT>The late?

115
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,640
<3-9,BRAM>他死了
<3-9,BRAM>He's dead?

116
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,110
<3-10,BECKETT>是的  在你告他伤人
<3-10,BECKETT>Yes, he was murdered the day after you filed

117
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,460
<3-10,BECKETT>之后一天被杀了
<3-10,BECKETT>an assault charge against him.

118
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,190
<3-11,BRAM>肯定不是我杀的
<3-11,BRAM>Well, I certainly did not kill him.

119
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,770
<3-11,BRAM>我告他是为了保护自己
<3-11,BRAM>I filed those charges to protect myself.

120
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,860
<3-12,BECKETT>为什么
<3-12,BECKETT>From what?

121
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,790
<3-13,BRAM>哈希姆是我的学生
<3-13,BRAM>Hasim was a student of mine.

122
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,620
<3-13,BRAM>我是一门关于乔依斯的课程的助教
<3-13,BRAM>I'm a T.A. for a seminar on Joyce.

123
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,700
<3-14,BECKETT>你俩之间有什么过节
<3-14,BECKETT>What was the problem with the two of you?

124
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,290
<3-15,BRAM>之前没有
<3-15,BRAM>I didn't think that there was one.

125
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,460
<3-15,BRAM>直到三天前
<3-15,BRAM>And then three days ago,

126
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,090
<3-15,BRAM>他课后堵了我
<3-15,BRAM>he confronts me after class.

127
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,410
<3-15,BRAM>指责我...
<3-15,BRAM>Starts accusing me of being...

128
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,990
<3-15,BRAM>跟某些女学生混得太熟
<3-15,BRAM>overly familiar with some female students.

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,310
<3-15,BRAM>他说我要继续这样的话
<3-15,BRAM>Said if I didn't stop,

130
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
<3-15,BRAM>就杀了我
<3-15,BRAM>he'd kill me.

131
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,250
<3-16,BECKETT>为了骚扰那些女学生
<3-16,BECKETT>For harassing those women?

132
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,230
<3-17,BRAM>不  我没有骚扰她们
<3-17,BRAM>No, I was not harassing them.

133
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,420
<3-17,BRAM>我  我也许偶尔
<3-17,BRAM>I... I might flirt

134
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,440
<3-17,BRAM>会跟女学生调调情
<3-17,BRAM>with students on occasion.

135
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,830
<3-17,BRAM>但相信我  她们并不讨厌这样
<3-17,BRAM>But believe me, it was never unwelcome.

136
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,380
<3-17,BRAM>最近妹子们都很迷吸血鬼那套
<3-17,BRAM>Ladies are kind of digging on vampires right now.

137
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,240
<3-17,BRAM>我又叫布莱姆·斯托克
<3-17,BRAM>My name is Bram Stoker.

138
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,400
<3-17,BRAM>这名字终于给我带来了桃花运
<3-17,BRAM>For once in my life, it's working for me.

139
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,480
<3-18,CASTLE>也许哈希姆吃醋了
<3-18,CASTLE>Maybe Hasim was jealous.

140
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,940
<3-18,CASTLE>那些女学生中  有没有哪个是他女朋友
<3-18,CASTLE>Were any of those students his girlfriend?

141
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,210
<3-19,BRAM>没有  他没有女朋友
<3-19,BRAM>No, I-I don't think he had a girlfriend

142
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,590
<3-19,BRAM>甚至连朋友都没有
<3-19,BRAM>or friends at all, for that matter.

143
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,100
<3-20,BECKETT>我需要跟你调过情的
<3-20,BECKETT>Okay, well, I'm gonna need a list of all the girls

144
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,300
<3-20,BECKETT>所有女学生的名单
<3-20,BECKETT>that you flirted with.

145
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,850
<4-1,RYAN>瞧瞧这栋楼
<4-1,RYAN>Look at this building.

146
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,240
<4-1,RYAN>作为一个大学生  哈希姆过得可真舒坦
<4-1,RYAN>Hasim was living large for a college student.

147
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,650
<4-2,ESPOSITO>是啊  这老兄的不思议事件簿里
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, add that to the list of things

148
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,890
<4-2,ESPOSITO>又要再添一笔
<4-2,ESPOSITO>about this dude that don't add up.

149
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,080
<4-2,ESPOSITO>他档案里写着  24岁刚上大学
<4-2,ESPOSITO>His records say he started as a freshman at 24.

150
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,170
<4-2,ESPOSITO>谁会这么晚上大学啊
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Now who does that?

151
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,140
<4-3,RYAN>发育得晚吧
<4-3,RYAN>A late bloomer.

152
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,720
<4-4,ESPOSITO>或者是个潜伏的恐怖分子
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Or a sleeper-cell terrorist.

153
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,510
<4-5,ESPOSITO>你想啊
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Think about it.

154
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,500
<4-5,ESPOSITO>沙特阿拉伯人
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Saudi national,

155
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,940
<4-5,ESPOSITO>手持一支定制枪向货车射击
<4-5,ESPOSITO>he shot up a van with a customized SIG.

156
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,180
<4-5,ESPOSITO>我就这么一说
<4-5,ESPOSITO>I'm just saying...

157
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,680
<4-5,ESPOSITO>也许真是恐怖分子
<4-5,ESPOSITO>could be a terrorist.

158
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,560
<4-7,ESPOSITO>看看他这地方
<4-7,ESPOSITO>Look at all this gear.

159
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,370
<4-7,ESPOSITO>这家伙有自己的道场啊
<4-7,ESPOSITO>This guy practically has his own dojo.

162
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,030
<4-9,RYAN>要是他赤手空拳搞不定
<4-9,RYAN>And if his black-belt skills didn't get it done,

163
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,810
<4-9,RYAN>随时还有这些呢
<4-9,RYAN>he always had this.

164
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,200
<4-10,ESPOSITO>不止这些
<4-10,ESPOSITO>That's not all he's got.

165
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,630
<4-10,ESPOSITO>看  还有监控设备
<4-10,ESPOSITO>Look. Surveillance gear.

166
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,680
<4-11,RYAN>挺先进啊
<4-11,RYAN>State of the art.

167
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
<4-11,RYAN>比警局那些强太多了
<4-11,RYAN>Light-years ahead of anything the department has.

168
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,750
<4-11,RYAN>是啊
<4-11,RYAN>Yeah.

169
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,910
<4-12,ESPOSITO>这家伙到底是谁
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Who the hell is this guy?

170
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,420
<5-1,BECKETT>枪支可以说是恐怖分子
<5-1,BECKETT>Look, the guns could fit with terrorism,

171
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,110
<5-1,BECKETT>但那些窃听器材呢
<5-1,BECKETT>but the wiretapping equipment?

172
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,300
<5-2,CASTLE>也许他是间谍
<5-2,CASTLE>Maybe he's a spy.

173
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,450
<5-2,CASTLE>他受过军事训练
<5-2,CASTLE>He's got military training.

174
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,110
<5-2,CASTLE>这里写着  他曾是沙特特种部队的突击队员
<5-2,CASTLE>It says here he was a commando in the Saudi special forces.

175
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,250
<5-3,BECKETT>还有这个
<5-3,BECKETT>But then there's this--

176
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,260
<5-3,BECKETT>每个月都有人从瑞士的银行账户
<5-3,BECKETT>25 grand wired to him every month

177
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,050
<5-3,BECKETT>汇两万五给他
<5-3,BECKETT>from a Swiss bank account.

178
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,600
<5-3,BECKETT>不管他是干什么的  他资金充沛
<5-3,BECKETT>Whatever he was doing, he was well funded.

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,590
<5-4,CASTLE>他同学怎么说
<5-4,CASTLE>What did his fellow students have to say?

180
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,320
<5-5,BECKETT>我找布莱姆·斯托克名单上的
<5-5,BECKETT>Well, I talked to most of the girls

181
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,950
<5-5,BECKETT>大部分女学生谈过
<5-5,BECKETT>on Bram Stoker's list,

182
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,150
<5-5,BECKETT>她们都不知道哈希姆也上那课
<5-5,BECKETT>and none of them noticed Hasim in class

183
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,220
<5-5,BECKETT>甚至根本不认识他
<5-5,BECKETT>or even know who he was.

184
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,010
<5-5,BECKETT>这家伙像是隐形人
<5-5,BECKETT>It's like the guy was invisible.

185
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
<5-6,CASTLE>他就潜藏在别人眼皮子底下
<5-6,CASTLE>He was hiding in plain sight.

186
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,770
<5-6,CASTLE>一名外国特工
<5-6,CASTLE>A foreign agent

187
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,390
<5-6,CASTLE>为某项特别侦查任务极尽伪装
<5-6,CASTLE>in deep cover on some kind of special reconnaissance mission.

188
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,170
<5-7,BECKETT>那他为什么要向货车开枪
<5-7,BECKETT>So then why would he shoot up a van?

189
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,620
<5-8,CASTLE>也许开车的是杰克·鲍尔
<5-8,CASTLE>Maybe Jack Bauer was driving.

191
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,200
<5-8,CASTLE>莱恩正在交通监控录像里
<5-8,CASTLE>Yo. Ryan's hunting through traffic cam footage

192
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
<5-9,ESPOSITO>找那辆货车
<5-9,ESPOSITO>looking for that van.

193
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,880
<5-9,ESPOSITO>而哈希姆的事
<5-9,ESPOSITO>In the meantime, things with Hasim

194
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,380
<5-9,ESPOSITO>愈发奇怪了
<5-9,ESPOSITO>just keeping getting weirder.

195
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,140
<5-9,ESPOSITO>技术部查过那些监控设备
<5-9,ESPOSITO>Tech went over that surveillance gear.

196
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,180
<5-9,ESPOSITO>看样子他是在监控
<5-9,ESPOSITO>It looks like he was using it to monitor

197
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,010
<5-9,ESPOSITO>离他家半英里左右一栋公寓内
<5-9,ESPOSITO>an active bug installed in some apartment

198
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,480
<5-9,ESPOSITO>已开启的窃听器
<5-9,ESPOSITO>about a half a mile from his place.

199
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
<5-10,BECKETT>谁的公寓
<5-10,BECKETT>Whose apartment was it?

200
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,150
<5-11,ESPOSITO>根据租约来看  公寓主人是
<5-11,ESPOSITO>According to the lease, it belonged

201
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,870
<5-11,ESPOSITO>是这姑娘  莎拉·艾尔玛
<5-11,ESPOSITO>to this chick-- Sara El-Masri.

202
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,880
<5-11,ESPOSITO>我给她打了电话  还留了言
<5-11,ESPOSITO>I called and left a message on her cell phone.

203
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,090
<5-12,BECKETT>等一下  莎拉·艾尔玛是
<5-12,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Sara El-Masri was one of the students

204
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,440
<5-12,BECKETT>乔伊斯课程的学生
<5-12,BECKETT>in the Joyce class.

205
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,530
<5-12,BECKETT>她也在布莱姆·斯托克的名单上
<5-12,BECKETT>She was one of the girls on Bram Stoker's flirt list.

206
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,960
<5-13,CASTLE>她怎么说哈希姆
<5-13,CASTLE>What did she say about Hasim?

207
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
<5-14,BECKETT>没找到她  就留了言
<5-14,BECKETT>I-I couldn't reach her. I just left a message.

208
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,590
<5-15,RYAN>伙计们  你们快过来看看
<5-15,RYAN>Hey, guys. I got something here you need to see.

209
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,570
<6-1,RYAN>不幸的是  犯罪现场附近
<6-1,RYAN>Unfortunately, there were no traffic

210
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,260
<6-1,RYAN>没有交通或监控摄像头
<6-1,RYAN>or security cams near the crime scene.

211
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,390
<6-1,RYAN>但我们找到了这段片子
<6-1,RYAN>But we did find this footage,

212
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,610
<6-1,RYAN>拍下了哈希姆案发那条街的情况
<6-1,RYAN>shot down the street from where Hasim was hit.

213
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,680
<6-2,ESPOSITO>这辆绝对是撞他的货车
<6-2,ESPOSITO>That's definitely the van that took him out.

214
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,650
<6-2,ESPOSITO>前后都撞烂了  还能看到弹孔
<6-2,ESPOSITO>Front end's all crunched up. You can see the bullet holes.

215
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,890
<6-3,RYAN>再看这个
<6-3,RYAN>Yeah, now watch this.

216
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,080
<6-3,RYAN>等等
<6-3,RYAN>Wait. Uh...

217
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,220
<6-4,BECKETT>倒回她跑出来那里
<6-4,BECKETT>Go back to where she ran out.

218
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,370
<6-4,BECKETT>把脸放大
<6-4,BECKETT>Zoom in on her face.

219
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,500
<6-4,BECKETT>这是莎拉·艾尔玛
<6-4,BECKETT>That's Sara El-Masri.

220
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,120
<6-4,BECKETT>她被绑架了
<6-4,BECKETT>She was abducted.

221
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,310
<6-5,CASTLE>哈希姆为了救她被杀了
<6-5,CASTLE>And Hasim died trying to stop it.

231
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,670
<7-1,BECKETT>无论是谁  这个人绑架了一个女孩
<7-1,BECKETT>Whoever this is, he abducted a girl

232
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,990
<7-1,BECKETT>还杀了我们的被害人
<7-1,BECKETT>and he killed our victim.

233
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,740
<7-1,BECKETT>从视频中能看出他什么特征
<7-1,BECKETT>So what do we know about him from the video?

234
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,140
<7-2,RYAN>年近四十的男性
<7-2,RYAN>He's a male, late 30s,

235
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,190
<7-2,RYAN>无明显伤疤或文身
<7-2,RYAN>no distinguishing scars or tattoos.

236
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,870
<7-2,RYAN>我们把录像送往了联调局
<7-2,RYAN>But we sent the footage over to the FBI

237
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,800
<7-2,RYAN>看他们能否用面部识别软件识别出来
<7-2,RYAN>to see if they can run it through their facial recognition software.

238
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
<7-3,BECKETT>告诉他们绑架的事了吗
<7-3,BECKETT>Are they updated on the abduction?

239
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,420
<7-4,RYAN>对  他们要派一个探员过来保持联络
<7-4,RYAN>Yes, and they're sending over an agent to liaise.

240
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,430
<7-4,RYAN>与此同时  我们在检查其他交通摄像头
<7-4,RYAN>Meanwhile, we're checking other traffic cams

241
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,590
<7-4,RYAN>看看能否找到莎拉企图逃离后
<7-4,RYAN>to see if we can track where that van went

242
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,010
<7-4,RYAN>卡车的去向
<7-4,RYAN>after Sara tried to escape.

243
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,760
<7-5,CASTLE>哈希姆在监控她的公寓
<7-5,CASTLE>Hasim was surveilling her apartment

244
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,750
<7-5,CASTLE>并死在她被绑架地附近
<7-5,CASTLE>and he was nearby when she was kidnapped.

245
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,280
<7-5,CASTLE>这是为何  他们是什么关系
<7-5,CASTLE>But why? What was their relationship?

246
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,790
<7-6,RYAN>莎拉的室友要过来
<7-6,RYAN>Well, Sara's roommate's coming in.

247
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,120
<7-6,RYAN>或许她会有答案
<7-6,RYAN>Maybe she has an answer.

248
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,560
<7-6,RYAN>他们之间没有通话记录
<7-6,RYAN>There were no phone calls between them.

249
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,010
<7-6,RYAN>看来更像是他在跟踪她
<7-6,RYAN>It's looking more like he was stalking her.

250
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,620
<7-6,RYAN>他不仅在她家安了窃听器
<7-6,RYAN>Not only did he wiretap her place,

251
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,790
<7-6,RYAN>还上了两门跟她一起的课
<7-6,RYAN>he was also taking two classes that she was in.

252
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,450
<7-7,CASTLE>或许就像那部《窃听大阴谋》电影
<7-7,CASTLE>Maybe it's like "The Conversation."

253
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,470
<7-8,RYAN>不好意思  我没
<7-8,RYAN>I'm sorry. I don't--

254
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,410
<7-9,CASTLE>弗朗西斯·福特·科波拉导演
<7-9,CASTLE>Francis ford coppola.

255
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,670
<7-10,BECKETT>-吉恩·哈克曼主演  被低估的佳片  -谢谢
<7-10,BECKETT>- Gene hackm. Very underrated. - Thank you.

256
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,650
<7-11,CASTLE>在电影里  一个窃听专家
<7-11,CASTLE>Um, in it, a surveillance expert

257
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,420
<7-11,CASTLE>偶然听到一件针对被他监听的女人的阴谋
<7-11,CASTLE>overhears a plot against the woman he's bugging.

258
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,650
<7-11,CASTLE>或许哈希姆听到绑架的风声
<7-11,CASTLE>Maybe Hasim got wind of the kidnapping,

259
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,070
<7-11,CASTLE>企图阻止  却付出了生命的代价
<7-11,CASTLE>tried to thwart it, and paid with his life.

260
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,320
<7-12,BECKETT>那也无法解释他公寓中那些枪支
<7-12,BECKETT>Ah, that still doesn't explain the guns in his apartment.

261
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,540
<7-13,CASTLE>的确  吉恩·哈克曼可没有军火库
<7-13,CASTLE>True. Gene Hackman did not possess an arsenal.

262
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,200
<7-14,RYAN>有可能哈希姆也参与了绑架
<7-14,RYAN>So it could be that Hasim was in on the kidnapping

263
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,470
<7-14,RYAN>但中途出了差错
<7-14,RYAN>and it went sideways.

264
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,520
<7-14,RYAN>或是他临阵退缩了
<7-14,RYAN>Or he got cold feet.

265
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,400
<7-15,BECKETT>好  彻查他的电子邮件和通话记录
<7-15,BECKETT>All right, dig into his e-mails and phone records.

266
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,700
<7-15,BECKETT>看看他在和谁联系
<7-15,BECKETT>Let's see who he was in touch with.

267
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,550
<7-16,RYAN>这就去
<7-16,RYAN>On it.

268
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,060
<7-17,ESPOSITO>我查到莎拉·艾尔玛以下资料
<7-17,ESPOSITO>So here's what I've dug up on Sara El-Masri.

269
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,640
<7-17,ESPOSITO>她是大二学生  主修海洋生物学
<7-17,ESPOSITO>She's a sophomore majoring in marine biology.

270
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,570
<7-17,ESPOSITO>生于开罗  家中有亿万家产
<7-17,ESPOSITO>She was born in Cairo to an uber-wealthy Egyptian family.

271
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,340
<7-18,BECKETT>所以有可能是以赎金为目的的绑架
<7-18,BECKETT>So this could've been a kidnapping for ransom.

272
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,360
<7-18,BECKETT>她的父母呢
<7-18,BECKETT>Where are her parents?

273
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
<7-19,ESPOSITO>艾尔玛家在达科塔有处住宅
<7-19,ESPOSITO>The El-Masris have a place at the Dakota.

274
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,230
<7-19,ESPOSITO>他们正在赶来
<7-19,ESPOSITO>They're on their way in now.

275
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,610
<7-19,ESPOSITO>我难过得要死
<7-19,ESPOSITO>I am sick in my heart.

276
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,970
<7-19,ESPOSITO>我只
<7-19,ESPOSITO>I-I just...

277
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,030
<7-19,ESPOSITO>我只希望女儿平安归来
<7-19,ESPOSITO>I just want my daughter back.

278
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,640
<8-1,BECKETT>我们正在竭尽所能
<8-1,BECKETT>And we're doing everything that we can

279
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,240
<8-1,BECKETT>找到您的女儿  艾尔玛先生
<8-1,BECKETT>to make that happen, Mr. El-Masri,

280
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,640
<8-1,BECKETT>联调局也介入了
<8-1,BECKETT>along with the FBI.

281
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,410
<8-1,BECKETT>她才20岁
<8-1,BECKETT>She's only 20 years old,

282
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,080
<8-2,BECKETT>还是个孩子
<8-2,BECKETT>a child.

283
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,330
<8-2,BECKETT>是谁绑架了她
<8-2,BECKETT>Who did this to her?

284
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,890
<8-2,BECKETT>目前就我们了解
<8-2,BECKETT>Well, so far we know that

285
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,760
<8-2,BECKETT>至少有两人与其有关
<8-2,BECKETT>at least two people were involved.

286
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,010
<8-2,BECKETT>司机和这个男人
<8-2,BECKETT>The driver and this man.

287
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,750
<8-2,BECKETT>你们认识他吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Does he look familiar to you?

288
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,380
<8-3,ANWAR>我不认识  莉娜你呢
<8-3,ANWAR>No, not to me. Lina?

289
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,700
<8-4,LINA>不
<8-4,LINA>No.

290
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,850
<8-5,ANWAR>我会交赎金的
<8-5,ANWAR>I will pay them.

291
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,950
<8-5,ANWAR>不管他们要多少都给
<8-5,ANWAR>I will pay whatever they ask.

292
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,790
<8-6,LINA>如果他们要的不是钱呢
<8-6,LINA>What if that isn't what they want?

293
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,440
<8-6,LINA>你树敌无数  安瓦尔
<8-6,LINA>You've made enemies, Anwar.

294
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,840
<8-7,ANWAR>那是在埃及  不是这里  这就是为了钱
<8-7,ANWAR>In egypt, not here. This is about money.

295
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,920
<8-7,ANWAR>绑架案总是为了要钱
<8-7,ANWAR>It is--it's always about money.

296
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,430
<8-8,CASTLE>还跟这个男人有关
<8-8,CASTLE>It's also about this man.

297
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,290
<8-8,CASTLE>哈希姆·法鲁克  你见过他吗
<8-8,CASTLE>Hasim Farouk-- have you ever seen him?

298
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,550
<8-9,ANWAR>见过  我闻讯后曾尝试与他联络
<8-9,ANWAR>Yeah, I tried to reach hasim when I learned of this.

299
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,620
<8-9,ANWAR>或许他能帮助我们
<8-9,ANWAR>Perhaps he can help us I--

300
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,810
<8-10,CASTLE>等等  你认识他
<8-10,CASTLE>Wait. You know him?

301
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,280
<8-11,ANWAR>莎拉不愿带保镖
<8-11,ANWAR>Sara would not accept a bodyguard,

302
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,570
<8-11,ANWAR>所以我雇了哈希姆悄悄保护她
<8-11,ANWAR>so I hired Hasim to watch over her discreetly.

303
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,760
<8-11,ANWAR>他在哪
<8-11,ANWAR>Where is he?

304
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,580
<8-12,BECKETT>他为保护她而死
<8-12,BECKETT>He died trying to protect her.

305
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,960
<8-13,BECKETT>你雇了他保护莎拉
<8-13,BECKETT>Now you hired him to guard Sara.

306
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,460
<8-13,BECKETT>她有受到过威胁吗
<8-13,BECKETT>Was she receiving threats?

307
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,860
<8-13,BECKETT>没有
<8-13,BECKETT>No.

308
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,660
<8-14,ANWAR>但是我这地位的男人难免...
<8-14,ANWAR>But a man in my... position...

309
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,060
<8-14,ANWAR>我求过莎拉谨慎行事
<8-14,ANWAR>I-I begged Sara to be careful,

310
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,360
<8-14,ANWAR>但是她说"爸爸  你操心太过了"
<8-14,ANWAR>but she said, "Papa, you-- you worry too much."

311
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,050
<8-14,ANWAR>她现在像美国人一样思考  一样轻信
<8-14,ANWAR>She thinks like an American now. Tr-trusts like an American.

312
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,940
<8-14,ANWAR>我愿付出一切
<8-14,ANWAR>I will pay anything.

313
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,790
<8-15,ANWAR>她是我的独女
<8-15,ANWAR>She's my only child.

314
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,460
<8-15,ANWAR>求求你们
<8-15,ANWAR>Please.

315
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,000
<8-16,BECKETT>失陪
<8-16,BECKETT>Would you excuse us for a moment?

316
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,740
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>贝克特探长
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective Beckett,

317
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,190
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>卡塞尔先生
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Mr. Castle,

318
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>这位是哈里斯探员
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>this is Agent Harris.

319
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,930
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>他将负责这起绑架案
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>He'll be running point on the kidnapping.

320
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,670
<9-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>幸会
<9-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>Good to meet you.

321
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,950
<9-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>莱恩警探跟我汇报了进展
<9-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>Detective Ryan brought me up to speed on things.

322
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,430
<9-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>艾尔玛夫妇状态如何
<9-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>How are the El-Masris?

323
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,690
<9-3,BECKETT>饱受惊吓  心痛欲绝
<9-3,BECKETT>Scared. Devastated.

324
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,130
<9-4,HARRIS>这是好事
<9-4,HARRIS>Okay, that's good.

325
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,150
<9-5,CASTLE>是吗
<9-5,CASTLE>It is?

326
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,760
<9-6,HARRIS>比愤怒或是戒备好
<9-6,HARRIS>It beats angry or defensive.

327
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,140
<9-6,HARRIS>他们愿意诚实回答并提供帮助  这很重要
<9-6,HARRIS>They want to be helpful and honest, which is important,

328
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,070
<9-6,HARRIS>因为归根结底
<9-6,HARRIS>'cause at the end of the day,

329
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,630
<9-6,HARRIS>我们信息来源的准确度
<9-6,HARRIS>it's the accuracy of our information

330
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,000
<9-6,HARRIS>是决定案件是否告破的关键
<9-6,HARRIS>that can determine whether this ends well or badly.

331
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,510
<9-6,HARRIS>有事随时联系
<9-6,HARRIS>I'll keep you in the loop.

332
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,500
<9-7,BECKETT>我们也是
<9-7,BECKETT>We'll do the same.

333
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,640
<10-1,BECKETT>我派了莱恩和埃斯波西托去调查
<10-1,BECKETT>So I got Ryan and Esposito looking into

334
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,500
<10-1,BECKETT>莎拉昨晚之后的行踪
<10-1,BECKETT>Sara's movements from last night.

335
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,040
<10-1,BECKETT>我想能查明
<10-1,BECKETT>I figure if we can find out

336
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,340
<10-1,BECKETT>她去曼哈顿下区干什么
<10-1,BECKETT>what she was doing in lower Manhattan,

337
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,600
<10-1,BECKETT>可以帮助我们找到撞死哈希姆的人
<10-1,BECKETT>that could lead us to whoever killed Hasim.

338
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,290
<10-2,BECKETT>你还好吗
<10-2,BECKETT>Are you okay?

339
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,450
<10-3,CASTLE>我只是
<10-3,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. I just...

340
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,510
<10-3,CASTLE>无法想象他们此刻的感受
<10-3,CASTLE>can't imagine what they're going through right now.

341
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,130
<10-4,BECKETT>你觉得这真是为钱吗
<10-4,BECKETT>Do you think that this is really about money?

342
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,370
<10-5,CASTLE>我在网上搜了艾尔玛
<10-5,CASTLE>Did a web search on El-Masri.

343
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,110
<10-5,CASTLE>身价超过三亿美元
<10-5,CASTLE>He's worth over $300 million.

344
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,140
<10-6,BECKETT>但是谁会雇佣前突击队员
<10-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but still, who hires an ex-commando

345
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,760
<10-6,BECKETT>监护自己女儿呢
<10-6,BECKETT>to babysit their daughter?

346
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,240
<10-7,CASTLE>我也考虑这么做
<10-7,CASTLE>I've considered it.

347
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,120
<10-8,BECKETT>我毫不怀疑
<10-8,BECKETT>And I don't doubt that,

348
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,500
<10-8,BECKETT>但你注意到她妈妈提起敌人的时候
<10-8,BECKETT>but did you see how he shut her down

349
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,950
<10-8,BECKETT>他打断了她吗
<10-8,BECKETT>when she brought up enemies?

350
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,570
<10-9,CASTLE>他只是不想考虑那个最坏的可能
<10-9,CASTLE>He just doesn't want to believe the worst,

351
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,850
<10-9,CASTLE>老实说  我不怪他
<10-9,CASTLE>and frankly, I can't blame him.

352
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,230
<10-10,RYAN>我刚刚见过莎拉的室友安玻
<10-10,RYAN>Hey. So I just interviewed Sara's roommate Amber.

353
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,240
<10-10,RYAN>她对哈希姆和绑架的事一无所知
<10-10,RYAN>She wasn't any help with Hasim or the kidnapping,

354
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,170
<10-10,RYAN>不过她说莎拉昨晚出去了
<10-10,RYAN>but she did say that Sara went out last night.

355
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,080
<10-11,BECKETT>去哪里了
<10-11,BECKETT>Where did she go?

356
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,130
<10-12,RYAN>安玻只记得是
<10-12,RYAN>All Amber could remember

357
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,040
<10-12,RYAN>是什么科学活动
<10-12,RYAN>is that it was some kind of science thing.

358
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,030
<11-1,ESPOSITO>我找到三个昨晚在曼哈顿下区
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Okay, I found three science-related events

359
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,740
<11-1,ESPOSITO>举行的有关科学的活动
<11-1,ESPOSITO>in lower Manhattan from last night.

360
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,240
<11-1,ESPOSITO>离哈希姆遇害八街区远的地方
<11-1,ESPOSITO>First, a sci-fi movie marathon

361
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,040
<11-1,ESPOSITO>有个艺术剧院举办的科幻电影马拉松
<11-1,ESPOSITO>at an art house theater eight blocks from where Hasim got clocked.

362
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,830
<11-2,CASTLE>不过严格讲  科幻电影是不科学的
<11-2,CASTLE>Though, by definition, science fiction is not science.

363
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,650
<11-3,ESPOSITO>里面有那个词
<11-3,ESPOSITO>It has the word in it.

364
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,510
<11-4,CASTLE>说得好
<11-4,CASTLE>It's-- that's an excellent point.

365
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,550
<11-5,BECKETT>另外两个呢
<11-5,BECKETT>What are the other two?

366
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,510
<11-6,ESPOSITO>一个天文学家举办的观星之旅
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Uh, a stargazing tour led by an actual astronomer

367
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,340
<11-6,ESPOSITO>和一个叫海登·波斯纳的科学家的演讲
<11-6,ESPOSITO>and a speech from a scientist named Hayden Posner,

368
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
<11-6,ESPOSITO>在波蒙特酒店的宴会厅
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Uh, in the ballroom of the Beaumont Hotel.

369
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,330
<11-7,CASTLE>波斯纳博士  他是研究气候变化的专家
<11-7,CASTLE>Dr. Posner--he's an expert on climate change.

370
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,790
<11-7,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯给我买过他的书  不过我还没看
<11-7,CASTLE>Alexis bought me his book, which I still haven't read.

371
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,380
<11-8,BECKETT>波蒙特酒店也解释了
<11-8,BECKETT>And the Beaumont Hotel would explain

372
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,970
<11-8,BECKETT>为什么莎拉会去曼哈顿下区
<11-8,BECKETT>why Sara was in lower Manhattan.

373
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,120
<11-9,CASTLE>她是海洋生物学专业的
<11-9,CASTLE>And she's a marine biology major,

374
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,410
<11-9,CASTLE>意味着她会对气候变化有兴趣
<11-9,CASTLE>which means she would be interested in climate change.

375
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,290
<11-9,CASTLE>走吧
<11-9,CASTLE>Let's go.

376
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,440
<12-1,MANAGER>我记得她
<12-1,MANAGER>Yes, I remember her.

377
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,120
<12-1,MANAGER>一位漂亮的年轻女孩
<12-1,MANAGER>A very lovely young woman.

378
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,230
<12-1,MANAGER>莎拉·艾尔玛  对  她的确参加了
<12-1,MANAGER>Sara El-Masri. Yes, she definitely attended.

379
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,500
<12-1,MANAGER>是我为她登记的
<12-1,MANAGER>I checked her in myself.

380
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,310
<12-2,BECKETT>你注意到她有不对劲的地方吗
<12-2,BECKETT>Did you notice anything unusual about her?

381
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,000
<12-2,BECKETT>没有
<12-2,BECKETT>No.

382
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,570
<12-3,MANAGER>波斯纳博士演讲结束后
<12-3,MANAGER>After Dr. Posner's presentation,

383
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,020
<12-3,MANAGER>她留下参加了问答环节
<12-3,MANAGER>she stayed for the Q&A,

384
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,880
<12-3,MANAGER>很晚才结束  然后她就走了
<12-3,MANAGER>Which went rather late, and then she left.

385
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,040
<12-4,CASTLE>知道她去哪儿了吗
<12-4,CASTLE>Any idea where she went?

386
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,820
<12-5,MANAGER>我只知道她离开了宴会厅
<12-5,MANAGER>All I know is that she exited the ballroom.

387
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,090
<12-5,MANAGER>我留下来做婚宴的准备了
<12-5,MANAGER>I stayed on to set up for a wedding reception.

388
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,420
<12-6,CASTLE>她有和别人交流吗
<12-6,CASTLE>Did she speak with anyone?

389
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,290
<12-7,MANAGER>只有和她一起来的人
<12-7,MANAGER>Just the person she was with.

390
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,060
<12-8,CASTLE>是谁
<12-8,CASTLE>Who was that?

391
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,970
<12-9,MANAGER>一个年轻女孩
<12-9,MANAGER>A young woman.

392
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,670
<12-9,MANAGER>她们坐在一起  看起来是朋友
<12-9,MANAGER>They sat together. They seemed to be friends.

393
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,970
<12-9,MANAGER>但是我不知道她的名字
<12-9,MANAGER>But I couldn't tell you her name.

394
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,720
<12-10,BECKETT>可以描述一下吗
<12-10,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe this woman?

395
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,710
<12-11,MANAGER>红头发  白皮肤  也很漂亮
<12-11,MANAGER>Red hair, uh, pale skin, uh, also very lovely.

396
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,610
<12-12,CASTLE>我能看一下吗
<12-12,CASTLE>Can I... see that for a moment?

397
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,520
<12-12,CASTLE>是阿丽克西斯  她也在
<12-12,CASTLE>It's Alexis. She's on the list.

398
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,570
<12-12,CASTLE>她昨晚也在这儿
<12-12,CASTLE>She was here last night.

399
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,880
<12-13,BECKETT>也许她们认识呢
<12-13,BECKETT>Well, maybe she knows her.

400
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,290
<12-13,BECKETT>也许昨晚在活动认识的
<12-13,BECKETT>Maybe they met at the event.

401
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,330
<12-14,CASTLE>最起码  我知道她能帮我们
<12-14,CASTLE>At the very least, I'm sure she can help us out.

402
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,720
<12-15,CASTLE>这是她的铃声
<12-15,CASTLE>That's her ringtone.

403
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,040
<12-16,CASTLE>这是什么
<12-16,CASTLE>What's that?

404
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,180
<12-17,MANAGER>我们的失物招领处
<12-17,MANAGER>Our lost and found.

405
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,880
<12-17,MANAGER>实际上是昨晚有位客人交过来的
<12-17,MANAGER>In fact, a guest turned in a phone last night.

406
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,800
<12-17,MANAGER>在门前街上发现的
<12-17,MANAGER>They found it in the street out front.

407
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,980
<12-18,CASTLE>他们把阿丽克西斯也绑走了
<12-18,CASTLE>They took Alexis, too.

408
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,230
<13-1,HARRIS>卡塞尔先生
<13-1,HARRIS>Mr. Castle,

409
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,280
<13-1,HARRIS>我们会竭尽所能
<13-1,HARRIS>We will do everything in our power

410
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,450
<13-1,HARRIS>找回你的女儿的
<13-1,HARRIS>to get your daughter back.

411
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,420
<13-2,CASTLE>别这么应付我
<13-2,CASTLE>I don't want to be handled.

412
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,010
<13-2,CASTLE>告诉我进展如何
<13-2,CASTLE>Just let me know where things stand.

413
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,010
<13-3,HARRIS>从我们掌握的事实开始吧
<13-3,HARRIS>Let's start with the facts as we now understand them.

414
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,780
<13-3,HARRIS>你女儿和莎拉·艾尔玛一起参加了
<13-3,HARRIS>Your daughter attended last night's event

415
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,220
<13-3,HARRIS>昨晚的活动
<13-3,HARRIS>with Sara El-Masri.

416
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,070
<13-3,HARRIS>她们在环境科学课上认识
<13-3,HARRIS>Apparently they met in an environmental science class

417
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,150
<13-3,HARRIS>成为了朋友
<13-3,HARRIS>and became friends.

418
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,670
<13-3,HARRIS>定位系统显示昨晚活动结束后不久
<13-3,HARRIS>GPS on her phone shows that it was left outside the hotel

419
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,470
<13-3,HARRIS>她的手机就被扔在了酒店外
<13-3,HARRIS>shortly after the event ended.

420
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,800
<13-3,HARRIS>加上自此以后16小时内
<13-3,HARRIS>That plus the fact that no one has seen

421
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,920
<13-3,HARRIS>没人见过她或联系到她
<13-3,HARRIS>or heard from her in the 16 hours since

422
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,720
<13-3,HARRIS>我们可以断定她也被绑架了
<13-3,HARRIS>leads us to conclude that she, too, was forced into the van.

423
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,700
<13-4,BECKETT>如果莎拉是目标的话
<13-4,BECKETT>Now why would they take Alexis

424
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,120
<13-4,BECKETT>为什么也绑走阿丽克西斯呢
<13-4,BECKETT>if Sara was the target?

425
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,920
<13-5,HARRIS>她可能当时和莎拉在一起
<13-5,HARRIS>She was probably with Sara at the time.

426
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,900
<13-5,HARRIS>目击了一切
<13-5,HARRIS>She was a witness.

427
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,200
<13-5,HARRIS>把她一起带走
<13-5,HARRIS>It would've been easier to take her

428
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,240
<13-5,HARRIS>比...不带走要好
<13-5,HARRIS>than... not.

429
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,210
<13-6,CASTLE>你的意思是
<13-6,CASTLE>So you're saying she was

430
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,670
<13-6,CASTLE>她只是在错的时间出现在错的地方
<13-6,CASTLE>just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

431
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,000
<13-7,HARRIS>看起来是这样的
<13-7,HARRIS>It appears that way.

432
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,310
<13-8,BECKETT>有嫌疑人了吗
<13-8,BECKETT>Do you have any suspects?

433
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,420
<13-9,HARRIS>有了名字
<13-9,HARRIS>We have a name.

434
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,340
<13-9,HARRIS>面部识别系统查出了
<13-9,HARRIS>Facial recognition gave us an I.D.

435
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,000
<13-9,HARRIS>录像里那个男人的身份
<13-9,HARRIS>on the man in the video.

436
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,380
<13-9,HARRIS>罗杰·汉森
<13-9,HARRIS>Roger Henson.

437
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,640
<13-9,HARRIS>他是个中级毒品走私贩
<13-9,HARRIS>We know him mainly as a mid-level narcotics smuggler.

438
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,570
<13-10,BECKETT>知道他是谁
<13-10,BECKETT>If we know he's out there,

439
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,310
<13-10,BECKETT>我们就能抓到他
<13-10,BECKETT>we can get him.

440
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,760
<13-10,BECKETT>我们可以开始搜捕
<13-10,BECKETT>We can initiate a manhunt.

441
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,290
<13-11,HARRIS>我们已经开始寻找汉森了
<13-11,HARRIS>We're already searching for Henson

442
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,210
<13-11,HARRIS>以及他已知的全部同伙
<13-11,HARRIS>along with all his known associates.

443
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,960
<13-11,HARRIS>但他是个职业重犯
<13-11,HARRIS>But he is a career felon.

444
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,680
<13-11,HARRIS>要找到他很难
<13-11,HARRIS>Finding him won't be easy.

445
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,820
<13-12,CASTLE>一个毒品走私贩为什么会卷入绑架案呢
<13-12,CASTLE>What's a drug smuggler doing involved in a kidnapping?

446
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,760
<13-12,CASTLE>我们尚不确定
<13-12,CASTLE>We're not sure.

447
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,890
<13-13,HARRIS>但罗杰·汉森并不是发号施令的老大
<13-13,HARRIS>But Roger Henson is not a shot caller.

448
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,760
<13-13,HARRIS>他是个中间人  供人雇佣
<13-13,HARRIS>He's a middleman, a hired gun.

449
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,170
<13-13,HARRIS>或许有人雇佣他绑架那些女孩
<13-13,HARRIS>He may have been hired to abduct the girls.

450
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,430
<13-14,CASTLE>我们现在要怎么做
<13-14,CASTLE>What happens now?

451
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,700
<13-15,HARRIS>我们现在集合各方力量重点追捕汉森
<13-15,HARRIS>We press ahead on multiple fronts with a focus on Henson.

452
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,800
<13-15,HARRIS>找到他就可以破案
<13-15,HARRIS>Locating him could crack the case.

453
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,550
<13-15,HARRIS>我们也制定了一些临时计划
<13-15,HARRIS>We're also creating contingency plans

454
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,060
<13-15,HARRIS>以防绑匪突然主动联系
<13-15,HARRIS>for when and if the kidnappers make contact.

455
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,540
<13-16,CASTLE>以防  什么意思
<13-16,CASTLE>If? What do you mean if?

456
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,320
<13-17,BECKETT>我们知道艾尔玛很富有
<13-17,BECKETT>We know that the El-Masris are wealthy,

457
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,210
<13-17,BECKETT>你也告诉我们莎拉才是目标
<13-17,BECKETT>and you told us Sara was the target.

458
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,160
<13-18,HARRIS>艾尔玛先生承认
<13-18,HARRIS>Mr. El-masri admitted he had close ties

459
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,500
<13-18,HARRIS>他和埃及前任政要关系密切
<13-18,HARRIS>with the previous regime in Egypt.

460
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,870
<13-18,HARRIS>换来的是一些相当有权势的人成了他的敌人
<13-18,HARRIS>As a result, he made some very powerful enemies.

461
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,170
<13-18,HARRIS>他女儿被绑架很可能是针对他的报复行为
<13-18,HARRIS>It's possible his daughter's abduction was motivated by revenge.

462
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,730
<13-19,CASTLE>那我女儿会怎样
<13-19,CASTLE>Okay, where does that leave my daughter?

463
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,450
<13-19,CASTLE>我是说  如果...
<13-19,CASTLE>I mean, if...

464
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,950
<13-19,CASTLE>如果他们想绑的不是她
<13-19,CASTLE>If she wasn't the one they were after

465
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,290
<13-19,CASTLE>她只是个多余的...
<13-19,CASTLE>and she's just in the way--

466
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,930
<13-20,HARRIS>卡塞尔先生  你得积极一点
<13-20,HARRIS>Mr. Castle, you need to stay positive.

467
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,490
<13-20,HARRIS>不管他们的动机是什么
<13-20,HARRIS>Whatever their motives,

468
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,920
<13-20,HARRIS>绑匪都会意识到她是有价值的
<13-20,HARRIS>the kidnappers will realize she has value.

469
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,390
<13-20,HARRIS>我们接下来要做的  就是去你家
<13-20,HARRIS>Now what we need to do next is go to your home

470
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,650
<13-20,HARRIS>设圈套并追踪你家的电话
<13-20,HARRIS>and set up a trap and trace on your phone lines

471
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,060
<13-20,HARRIS>准备好  等他们来电
<13-20,HARRIS>so we're ready for their call.

472
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,140
<13-21,HARRIS>我在外面等你
<13-21,HARRIS>I'll wait for you outside.

473
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,130
<13-22,CASTLE>盖茨会看到的
<13-22,CASTLE>Gates will see.

474
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,320
<13-23,BECKETT>我不在乎
<13-23,BECKETT>I don't care.

475
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,610
<13-24,CASTLE>我真不敢相信竟然发生这样的事
<13-24,CASTLE>I can't believe this is happening.

476
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,280
<13-25,BECKETT>我们会找到她的  卡塞尔
<13-25,BECKETT>We're gonna find her, Castle.

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,690
<13-25,BECKETT>我们一定会的
<13-25,BECKETT>We will.

478
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,700
<14-1,GATES>你尽你所能
<14-1,GATES>You do whatever you need to do

479
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,430
<14-1,GATES>帮他救回宝贝女儿
<14-1,GATES>to get him back his little girl.

480
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,770
<14-1,GATES>需要什么尽管开口  探长
<14-1,GATES>Anything you need, Detective.

481
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,340
<14-2,BECKETT>谢谢你  长官
<14-2,BECKETT>Thank you, sir.

482
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,300
<14-3,ESPOSITO>他怎么样了
<14-3,ESPOSITO>How's he doing?

483
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,890
<14-4,RYAN>那可是阿丽克西斯  他一定崩溃了
<14-4,RYAN>It's Alexis. He's gotta be wrecked.

484
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,930
<14-4,RYAN>我都崩溃了
<14-4,RYAN>Hell, I'm wrecked.

485
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,490
<14-5,BECKETT>是啊  我们必须把个人情绪放到一边
<14-5,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we gotta put all of that aside

486
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,700
<14-5,BECKETT>帮助他找回女儿
<14-5,BECKETT>and help him find her.

487
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,610
<14-5,BECKETT>货车查得怎么样了
<14-5,BECKETT>Where are we on the van?

488
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,920
<14-6,ESPOSITO>我们一直在查看交通摄像头拍摄的录像
<14-6,ESPOSITO>We've been working the traffic cam footage

489
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,150
<14-6,ESPOSITO>有了进展
<14-6,ESPOSITO>and we made some headway.

490
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,420
<14-7,RYAN>货车离开曼哈顿下城区以后
<14-7,RYAN>After the van left lower Manhattan,

491
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,680
<14-7,RYAN>我们在东河快车道上发现了它
<14-7,RYAN>we picked it up on East River Drive,

492
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,650
<14-7,RYAN>驶向皇后区的城中隧道
<14-7,RYAN>heading towards the queens midtown tunnel.

493
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,310
<14-8,BECKETT>我们必须查清那辆车的去向
<14-8,BECKETT>We gotta figure out where that van went.

494
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,380
<14-8,BECKETT>我们再找些人手来查看监控录像
<14-8,BECKETT>Let's bring in some more bodies to review the footage.

495
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,500
<14-8,BECKETT>找到那辆货车  就能找到阿丽克西斯
<14-8,BECKETT>We find the van, we'll find Alexis.

496
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,620
<15-1,CASTLE>你如果需要什么  就告诉我们
<15-1,CASTLE>You'll let us know if you need anything?

497
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,570
<15-2,FBI TECH GUY>当然  先生
<15-2,FBI TECH GUY>Certainly, sir.

498
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,710
<15-3,CASTLE>妈...
<15-3,CASTLE>Oh, mother...

499
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,750
<15-3,CASTLE>我很抱歉
<15-3,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

500
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,740
<15-3,CASTLE>我真的很抱歉
<15-3,CASTLE>I am so sorry.

501
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,100
<15-4,MARTHA>理查德  这不是你的错
<15-4,MARTHA>Richard, this is not your fault.

502
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,350
<15-5,CASTLE>我不知道  如果我...
<15-5,CASTLE>I don't know. Maybe if I'd just--

503
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,330
<15-6,MARTHA>没有如果  别拿如果来折磨自己
<15-6,MARTHA>No ifs. Do not torture yourself with ifs.

504
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,760
<15-6,MARTHA>唯一该怪罪的就是抓走她的那些人
<15-6,MARTHA>The only people to blame for this are the ones who took her.

505
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,140
<15-6,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯遗传了她父亲的品质
<15-6,MARTHA>Alexis is her father's daughter.

506
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,100
<15-6,MARTHA>她很坚强  很聪明
<15-6,MARTHA>She is strong and she is smart

507
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,470
<15-6,MARTHA>她一定会挺过这一关的
<15-6,MARTHA>and she is going to get through this.

508
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,410
<15-7,CASTLE>是啊  我知道
<15-7,CASTLE>Yeah, I know.

509
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,080
<15-8,MARTHA>不不不  我不是随便说说
<15-8,MARTHA>No, no, no. I'm not just saying this.

510
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,100
<15-8,MARTHA>她一定会平安无事的
<15-8,MARTHA>She's gonna be all right.

511
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,430
<15-8,MARTHA>我的心能感觉到  我的心是从来不会错的
<15-8,MARTHA>I feel it in my heart, and my heart is never wrong.

512
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,370
<15-9,CASTLE>那你的第一次婚姻呢
<15-9,CASTLE>What about your first marriage?

513
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,840
<15-11,CASTLE>第二次呢
<15-11,CASTLE>And your second?

514
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,500
<15-12,MARTHA>好吧  行了行了
<15-12,MARTHA>Okay, fine, fine.

515
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,810
<15-12,MARTHA>有时候  我的心也会失误
<15-12,MARTHA>Occasionally, my heart is wrong.

516
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,140
<15-12,MARTHA>但在这件事上不会
<15-12,MARTHA>But it is not in this case.

517
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,590
<15-13,CASTLE>我一直在想
<15-13,CASTLE>I just keep wondering,

518
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,840
<15-13,CASTLE>那些绑匪是怎么知道
<15-13,CASTLE>how did the kidnappers know

519
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,460
<15-13,CASTLE>莎拉会出现在波蒙特宾馆的呢
<15-13,CASTLE>Sara was gonna be at the Beaumont hotel?

520
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,670
<15-14,MARTHA>有凯特·贝克特
<15-14,MARTHA>You have Kate Beckett

521
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,040
<15-14,MARTHA>和联调局的人寻找阿丽克西斯
<15-14,MARTHA>and the FBI tracking Alexis down.

522
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,560
<15-14,MARTHA>让他们好好做自己的工作
<15-14,MARTHA>Just let them do their job.

523
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,000
<15-14,MARTHA>他们需要你守在这儿
<15-14,MARTHA>And they need for you to be here.

524
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,910
<15-14,MARTHA>好的
<15-14,MARTHA>Okay.

525
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,070
<16-1,BECKETT>你们查到什么了
<16-1,BECKETT>What do you got?

526
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,070
<16-2,ESPOSITO>货车出了皇后区  进了城中隧道
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Our van exited the Queens to midtown tunnel...

527
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,050
<16-2,ESPOSITO>到达绿点
<16-2,ESPOSITO>to Greenpoint.

528
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,990
<16-2,ESPOSITO>上了绿点大道  到达麦吉尼斯
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Took Greenpoint Ave. To McGuinness...

529
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,920
<16-2,ESPOSITO>他们向西上了休伦大街
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Then went west on Huron.

530
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,840
<16-3,BECKETT>然后货车去哪儿了
<16-3,BECKETT>Then where'd the van go?

531
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,610
<16-4,RYAN>还不确定  但基本就是这块区域
<16-4,RYAN>Well, we're not sure, but this area right here,

532
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,190
<16-4,RYAN>由绿点  麦吉尼斯和弗兰克林大道围成的
<16-4,RYAN>It's pretty much boxed in by Greenpoint ave, McGuinness and Franklin.

533
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,610
<16-5,ESPOSITO>我们调取了那些街道上的监控录像
<16-5,ESPOSITO>We check the video feeds from those streets.

534
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,490
<16-5,ESPOSITO>货车驶入了那片街区
<16-5,ESPOSITO>The van went into that neighborhood,

535
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,420
<16-5,ESPOSITO>但再也没出来
<16-5,ESPOSITO>but never came out.

536
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,340
<16-6,RYAN>两个女孩一定是在那片区域
<16-6,RYAN>The girls have to be somewhere in there...

537
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,610
<16-6,RYAN>汉森也是
<16-6,RYAN>along with Henson.

538
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,920
<16-7,BECKETT>要搜索的区域有多大
<16-7,BECKETT>Okay, so how big is our search zone?

539
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,780
<16-8,ESPOSITO>20个街区
<16-8,ESPOSITO>20 square blocks.

540
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,940
<16-9,BECKETT>和联调局以及皇后区的警察合作
<16-9,BECKETT>Okay, coordinate with the feds and Queens P.D.

541
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,310
<16-9,BECKETT>我们需要逐条街搜索那辆货车
<16-9,BECKETT>We need to do a street by street search for that van.

542
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,590
<16-9,BECKETT>只能穿便衣  不能开警车
<16-9,BECKETT>Plainclothes and unmarked cars only.

544
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,130
<17-1,ALEXIS>我今早坐在南院喷泉边
<17-1,ALEXIS>So I'm sitting by the fountain on the south quad this morning,

545
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,360
<17-1,ALEXIS>啜饮着黑糖玛奇朵
<17-1,ALEXIS>sipping my macchiato,

546
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,650
<17-1,ALEXIS>想复习化学考试时
<17-1,ALEXIS>trying to study for a chem quiz,

547
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,830
<17-1,ALEXIS>我心想
<17-1,ALEXIS>and I had this...

548
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,330
<17-1,ALEXIS>我想这是又一次"新生时刻"
<17-1,ALEXIS>I guess it was another freshman moment.

549
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,830
<17-1,ALEXIS>我肯定最终我会变得厌倦  愤世嫉俗
<17-1,ALEXIS>I'm sure eventually I'll become jaded and cynical,

550
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,650
<17-1,ALEXIS>可今天还没有
<17-1,ALEXIS>but not today.

551
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,170
<17-1,ALEXIS>今天我环顾四周  看到漂亮的楼群
<17-1,ALEXIS>Today I look around, and I see beautiful buildings,

552
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,790
<17-1,ALEXIS>我看到学生们和我一样
<17-1,ALEXIS>I see students who are just like me

553
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,120
<17-1,ALEXIS>却没有共同之处  我感到...
<17-1,ALEXIS>and nothing like me, and I feel...

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,310
<17-1,ALEXIS>不知所措  各种各样的可能性中
<17-1,ALEXIS>overwhelmed... with all the possibilities,

555
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,420
<17-1,ALEXIS>我如此幸运  成为了其中一份子
<17-1,ALEXIS>with how lucky I am to be a part of this

556
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,200
<17-1,ALEXIS>这一刻  我是有多不情愿置身别处
<17-1,ALEXIS>and... how there's nowhere on earth I'd rather be right now.

557
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,230
<17-2,ALEXIS>现在准备拉响极客警报
<17-2,ALEXIS>Now stand by for a geek alert.

558
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,010
<17-2,ALEXIS>我和我朋友莎拉
<17-2,ALEXIS>Me and my friend Sara

566
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,120
<18-3,BECKETT>如果绑匪知道阿丽克西斯和莎拉是朋友
<18-3,BECKETT>if the kidnappers knew that Alexis and Sara were friends--

567
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,450
<18-4,CASTLE>他们知道  他们一定知道
<18-4,CASTLE>They did know. They had to know.

<18-4,CASTLE>他们通过这段视频追踪莎拉到了宾馆
<18-4,CASTLE>They tracked Sara to the hotel from this video.

<18-4,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯昨天下午2点36分上传的视频
<18-4,CASTLE>Alexis posted it yesterday afternoon at 2:36.

570
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,500
<18-4,CASTLE>绑匪一定登陆了她的网站
<18-4,CASTLE>The kidnappers must have accessed her web site.

571
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,170
<18-5,BECKETT>好  我这就联系技术部
<18-5,BECKETT>Okay, I'm contacting tech right now.

574
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,560
<18-7,BECKETT>这可能需要时间  得看...
<18-7,BECKETT>Which might take time, depending on--

575
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,220
<18-8,CASTLE>如果她没时间了呢
<18-8,CASTLE>What if she doesn't have time?

<18-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  听我说
<18-9,BECKETT>Castle, listen to me--

578
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,510
<18-10,CASTLE>除非你能找到她  不然别给我打包票
<18-10,CASTLE>Don't promise me you'll find her unless you can do it,

579
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,280
<18-10,CASTLE>因为
<18-10,CASTLE>because...

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,270
<18-10,CASTLE>我永远也不会原谅你

<19-1,CASTLE>Okay, thanks.

590
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,500
<19-1,CASTLE>好  我会的
<19-1,CASTLE>Yeah, I will.

591
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,570
<19-1,CASTLE>刚刚跟分局警督通了电话
<19-1,CASTLE>That was L.T. from the precinct.

592
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,550
<19-1,CASTLE>他说他只知道
<19-1,CASTLE>He said all he knows is that

593
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,860
<19-1,CASTLE>他们发现货车从昨晚一直停到现在
<19-1,CASTLE>they found the van parked since last night.

594
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,580
<19-2,MARTHA>贝克特一有消息就会联系你
<19-2,MARTHA>Well, Beckett will call you as soon as she has some news.

595
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,630
<19-3,CASTLE>货车在绿点
<19-3,CASTLE>The van's in Greenpoint.

596
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,680
<19-3,CASTLE>她在一小时前就应该到了
<19-3,CASTLE>She would've gotten there over an hour ago.

597
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,380
<19-3,CASTLE>她还没联系我的唯一原因是...
<19-3,CASTLE>The only reason she wouldn't have called--

598
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,990
<19-4,MARTHA>别说了  理查德
<19-4,MARTHA>Stop it, Richard.

599
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,840
<19-4,MARTHA>别往坏处想
<19-4,MARTHA>We--we don't know that.

600
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,400
<19-5,MARTHA>亲爱的  去绿点  快去
<19-5,MARTHA>Oh, darling, go to Greenpoint. Go.

601
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,100
<19-5,MARTHA>快去  这里我来打理
<19-5,MARTHA>Go. I can handle things here.

602
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,520
<20-1,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你来干什么
<20-1,CASTLE>Castle, what are you doing here?

603
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,960
<20-2,BECKETT>分局的人告诉我你们发现了那辆货车
<20-2,BECKETT>The precinct told me that you found the van.

604
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,890
<20-3,CASTLE>你为什么不联系我
<20-3,CASTLE>Why the hell wouldn't you call me?

605
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,180
<20-4,BECKETT>因为我们还没确定
<20-4,BECKETT>'cause we don't know what this is yet.

606
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,610
<20-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  拜托  你没必要看这个  好吗
<20-4,BECKETT>Castle, please, you don't need to see this, okay?

607
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,420
<20-6,BECKETT>-车里是什么  -卡塞尔  拜托别...
<20-6,BECKETT>- What's in the van? - Castle, just please--

608
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,570
<20-5,CASTLE>车里是什么
<20-5,CASTLE>What's in the van?!

609
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,730
<20-8,CASTLE>蕾妮  这是谁的血
<20-8,CASTLE>Oh, Lanie. Whose blood is that?

610
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,000
<20-9,CASTLE>有人死在里面吗
<20-9,CASTLE>Did someone die in there?

611
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,660
<20-9,CASTLE>蕾妮  她死在车里了吗
<20-9,CASTLE>Lanie, did she die in there?

612
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,600
<20-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们还不确定  好吗
<20-10,BECKETT>Castle, we don't know, okay?

613
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,320
<20-10,BECKETT>还没查明  蕾妮才赶到
<20-10,BECKETT>Not yet. Lanie just got here.

614
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,000
<20-11,LANIE>阿丽克西斯是什么血型
<20-11,LANIE>What is Alexis' blood type?

615
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,080
<20-12,CASTLE>A型阳性
<20-12,CASTLE>A-positive.

616
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,470
<20-13,LANIE>好  马上就好
<20-13,LANIE>Okay, just give me a minute.

617
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,060
<20-14,BECKETT>快  到这边来
<20-14,BECKETT>Come on. Let's go over here.

618
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,220
<20-15,CASTLE>血型匹配吗
<20-15,CASTLE>Is it a match?

619
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,350
<20-16,LANIE>这是B型阴性  不是你女儿的血
<20-16,LANIE>It's B-negative. It's not from your baby.

620
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,270
<20-17,BECKETT>天呐  谢谢
<20-17,BECKETT>Oh, god. Thank you.

621
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,430
<20-18,LANIE>我马上回来  亲爱的
<20-18,LANIE>I'm right there with you, honey.

622
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,480
<20-18,LANIE>我得去告诉哈里斯探员
<20-18,LANIE>I gotta go let Agent Harris know.

623
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,290
<20-19,CASTLE>那她安全了  她就在这里某个地方  对吗
<20-19,CASTLE>So she's safe. She's here somewhere, right?

624
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,840
<20-19,CASTLE>她肯定就在附近
<20-19,CASTLE>She's gotta be around here somewhere?

625
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,660
<20-19,CASTLE>现在不在了
<20-19,CASTLE>She was.

626
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,160
<20-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  从车上留下的血迹
<20-20,BECKETT>Castle, there was a blood trail

627
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,800
<20-20,BECKETT>一路下来中断了
<20-20,BECKETT>that led from the van, and it stopped.

628
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,850
<20-20,BECKETT>我们认为绑匪换了车
<20-20,BECKETT>We think that the kidnappers changed cars.

629
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,010
<20-21,CASTLE>谁的车
<20-21,CASTLE>Whose van is it?

630
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,280
<20-22,BECKETT>一周前就失窃了
<20-22,BECKETT>It was stolen a week ago.

631
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,120
<20-23,CASTLE>有指纹吗
<20-23,CASTLE>Any fingerprints?

632
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,230
<20-23,CASTLE>鉴证组在找
<20-23,CASTLE>C.S.U. is looking.

633
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,890
<20-24,BECKETT>警员们已经在排查这片区域了
<20-24,BECKETT>We've got uniforms canvassing the area.

634
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,900
<20-24,BECKETT>卡塞尔  听着  如果有线索
<20-24,BECKETT>Castle, listen, if there is a lead,

635
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,990
<20-25,LANIE>我们会找到的
<20-25,LANIE>we are gonna find it.

637
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,270
<20-26,BECKETT>我去去就回  好吗
<20-26,BECKETT>I'll be right back. Okay?

638
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,710
<20-26,BECKETT>艾尔玛夫妇  我得和你们谈谈
<20-26,BECKETT>Mr. And Mrs. El-Masri, I need to speak to you for a moment.

639
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,990
<20-27,LINA>我们相当肯定
<20-27,LINA>We're absolutely positive.

640
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,790
<20-27,LINA>我们验了两遍血以确保准确性
<20-27,LINA>We tested the blood twice just to be sure.

641
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,730
<20-27,LINA>那血不是莎拉的
<20-27,LINA>The blood, it's not from Sara.

642
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,030
<20-28,CASTLE>也不是阿丽克西斯的
<20-28,CASTLE>And not Alexis either.

643
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,140
<20-29,ANWAR>那就还有希望
<20-29,ANWAR>Then there's hope.

644
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,390
<20-30,CASTLE>对
<20-30,CASTLE>Yeah.

645
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,710
<20-31,ANWAR>你女儿也牵扯了进来  很遗憾
<20-31,ANWAR>I-I regret that your daughter was drawn into this.

646
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,970
<20-32,CASTLE>他们到底被牵扯进了什么事
<20-32,CASTLE>What is it exactly they've been drawn into?

647
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,230
<20-33,ANWAR>我要知道就好了
<20-33,ANWAR>I wish I knew.

648
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,070
<21-1,ALEXIS>莎拉
<21-1,ALEXIS>Sara?

649
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,750
<21-1,ALEXIS>莎拉
<21-1,ALEXIS>Sara?

650
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,680
<21-1,ALEXIS>莎拉  你还好吗
<21-1,ALEXIS>Sara, are you okay?

651
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,350
<21-2,ALEXIS>我想是的
<21-2,ALEXIS>I think.

652
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,510
<21-2,ALEXIS>我们在哪儿
<21-2,ALEXIS>Where are we?

653
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,350
<21-2,ALEXIS>我不知道
<21-2,ALEXIS>I don't know.

654
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,190
<21-3,SARA>等等  那场讲座  酒店
<21-3,SARA>Wait. The speech. The hotel.

655
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,970
<21-3,SARA>我们离开了酒店  然后那个人
<21-3,SARA>We left the hotel and then that guy,

656
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,960
<21-3,SARA>他把我们拖进一辆货车
<21-3,SARA>He forced us into a van

657
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,650
<21-3,SARA>我脑子里一片混沌
<21-3,SARA>and... it's all a bit of a blur.

658
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,540
<21-4,ALEXIS>我想我们是被下药了
<21-4,ALEXIS>I think we were drugged.

659
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,770
<21-5,SARA>我们还穿着衣服
<21-5,SARA>We still have our clothes on.

660
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,320
<21-5,SARA>至少这是个好兆头
<21-5,SARA>At least that's a good sign.

661
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,210
<21-6,SARA>都是我的错
<21-6,SARA>This is all my fault.

662
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,810
<21-6,SARA>从我进寄宿学校开始
<21-6,SARA>My parents warned me about this

663
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,050
<21-6,SARA>他们就一直警告我
<21-6,SARA>since they first sent me to boarding school.

664
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,810
<21-6,SARA>他们甚至强迫我听了一场
<21-6,SARA>They even made me sit through a lecture on kidnapping

665
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,720
<21-6,SARA>企业安保负责人关于绑架的讲座
<21-6,SARA>from the head of corporate security.

666
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,810
<21-7,ALEXIS>等等  为什么会有人绑架你
<21-7,ALEXIS>Wait. Why would somebody kidnap you?

667
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,480
<21-8,SARA>我父亲很富有
<21-8,SARA>My father's crazy rich.

668
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,180
<21-8,SARA>好的一面是  他付得起赎金
<21-8,SARA>Well, the good news is, is that he'll pay the ransom.

669
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,210
<21-8,SARA>这就是他绑架我们的目的  对吧
<21-8,SARA>I mean, that's what this must be, right?

670
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,040
<21-9,ALEXIS>是的
<21-9,ALEXIS>Right.

671
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,110
<21-10,ALEXIS>无论如何  我爸爸会找到我们的
<21-10,ALEXIS>Anyway, my dad will find us.

672
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,790
<21-10,ALEXIS>他和警察一起工作
<21-10,ALEXIS>He works with the police.

673
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,380
<21-10,ALEXIS>他肯定正在找我们
<21-10,ALEXIS>I'm sure he's looking for us right now.

674
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
<21-11,SARA>那他们会救我们出去的吧
<21-11,SARA>So they'll get us out of here?

675
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,220
<21-12,ALEXIS>我很好奇里面有什么
<21-12,ALEXIS>I wonder what's in there.

676
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,390
<21-13,SARA>好吧  这太诡异了
<21-13,SARA>Okay, this is creepy.

677
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,060
<21-14,ALEXIS>浴衣  毛巾
<21-14,ALEXIS>Clothes, towels?

678
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,070
<21-14,ALEXIS>这至少证明他们想让我们活着
<21-14,ALEXIS>At least this means they want us alive.

679
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,070
<21-14,ALEXIS>对吧
<21-14,ALEXIS>See?

680
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,370
<21-15,ALEXIS>他们要留活口
<21-15,ALEXIS>They're taking care of us.

681
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,300
<22-1,BECKETT>是哈里斯探员打来的电话
<22-1,BECKETT>That was Agent Harris.

682
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,750
<22-1,BECKETT>目击者看到一辆黑色的育空汽车
<22-1,BECKETT>A witness saw a black Yukon leaving Greenpoint

683
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,720
<22-1,BECKETT>刚好在货车到达后离开了绿色区域
<22-1,BECKETT>just after the van arrived.

684
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,760
<22-1,BECKETT>绑架者一定换乘了那辆育空
<22-1,BECKETT>The kidnappers must have switched over to the Yukon.

685
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,340
<22-2,CASTLE>他们领先我们整整一天
<22-2,CASTLE>They've had a 24-hour head start.

686
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,680
<22-2,CASTLE>他们现在可能在任何地方
<22-2,CASTLE>They could be anywhere by now.

687
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,840
<22-2,CASTLE>血液调查鉴证组有消息吗
<22-2,CASTLE>Where's C.S.U. on the blood?

688
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,130
<22-3,BECKETT>根据血液飞溅分析  血是司机的
<22-3,BECKETT>Spatter analysis shows that it came from the driver.

689
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,530
<22-3,BECKETT>他被哈希姆击中了
<22-3,BECKETT>He was shot by Hasim.

690
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,720
<22-4,CASTLE>他可能在货车里留下了指纹
<22-4,CASTLE>He would've left prints in the van.

691
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,670
<22-4,CASTLE>他的指纹一定在指纹库里
<22-4,CASTLE>He must be in the system.

692
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,890
<22-5,BECKETT>不  犯罪现场组只找到了罗杰·汉森的指纹
<22-5,BECKETT>No. C.S.U. only found Roger Henson's prints.

693
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,480
<22-5,BECKETT>没有其他匹配者
<22-5,BECKETT>There's no other matches.

694
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,690
<22-6,CASTLE>这其中一定有线索
<22-6,CASTLE>We must have a lead here somewhere.

695
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,960
<22-7,ESPOSITO>可能是这个
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Maybe we do.

696
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,220
<22-7,ESPOSITO>鉴证组调查了那辆货车
<22-7,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. inspected the van.

697
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,010
<22-7,ESPOSITO>发现车被改装过
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Found that a bunch of performance tweaks were done to it--

698
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,790
<22-7,ESPOSITO>汽油罐里加了马力加强剂
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Octane booster in the tank,

699
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,800
<22-7,ESPOSITO>催化式排气净化器被改装
<22-7,ESPOSITO>catalytic converter was bypassed,

700
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,410
<22-7,ESPOSITO>电子控制器被重新切割以加大马力
<22-7,ESPOSITO>the E.C.U. was re-chipped to boost up the horsepower.

701
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,980
<22-8,CASTLE>有人改装了车子以方便逃跑
<22-8,CASTLE>Somebody upgraded it to a getaway car.

702
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,640
<22-9,ESPOSITO>不是随便什么人
<22-9,ESPOSITO>Not just somebody.

703
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,570
<22-9,ESPOSITO>他是专业的
<22-9,ESPOSITO>A real pro.

704
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,590
<22-9,ESPOSITO>可能是司机
<22-9,ESPOSITO>Probably our driver.

705
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,930
<22-10,BECKETT>找出这个人
<22-10,BECKETT>Okay, look for a wheelman

706
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,270
<22-10,BECKETT>他的作案手法是偷车并将其改装
<22-10,BECKETT>whose M.O. is to steal getaway cars and retune them.

707
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,710
<22-10,BECKETT>他是B型Rh阴性血
<22-10,BECKETT>Someone with B-negative blood.

708
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,350
<22-10,BECKETT>好的
<22-10,BECKETT>Right.

709
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,020
<23-1,ALEXIS>那个安保负责人
<23-1,ALEXIS>That security guy,

710
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,010
<23-1,ALEXIS>你说他告诉过你关于绑架的事
<23-1,ALEXIS>you said he talked to you about kidnapping.

711
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,150
<23-1,ALEXIS>他具体说了什么
<23-1,ALEXIS>What kind of stuff did he say?

712
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,470
<23-2,SARA>要是没人在找我们怎么办
<23-2,SARA>What if no one's looking for us?

713
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,060
<23-2,SARA>要是根本没人发现我们失踪了怎么办
<23-2,SARA>What if they don't even realize that we're gone?

714
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,400
<23-3,ALEXIS>莎拉  我们想想目前能解决的问题吧
<23-3,ALEXIS>Sara, let's focus on the questions we can answer,

715
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,190
<23-3,ALEXIS>基于我们知道的事情
<23-3,ALEXIS>build on what we know.

716
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,090
<23-4,SARA>我们一无所知  这才是问题所在
<23-4,SARA>We don't know anything. That's the problem.

717
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,190
<23-4,SARA>我们不知道谁绑架了我们
<23-4,SARA>We don't know who took us

718
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,360
<23-4,SARA>我们还要在这儿呆多久  身在何方
<23-4,SARA>Or for how long we'll be here or even where we are.

719
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,890
<23-5,ALEXIS>那我们来推测一下
<23-5,ALEXIS>Okay. Well, let's figure that out.

720
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,860
<23-5,ALEXIS>来想想我们在哪儿
<23-5,ALEXIS>Let's figure out where we are.

721
00:26:59,370 --> 00:26:59,990
<23-5,ALEXIS>听到了吗
<23-5,ALEXIS>Hear that?

722
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,580
<23-5,ALEXIS>地下是空的  所以我们不在地下室里
<23-5,ALEXIS>Space under the floor. So we're not in a basement.

723
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,440
<23-6,SARA>这栋建筑年代较久
<23-6,SARA>And this is a much older building,

724
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,110
<23-6,SARA>从破旧的地板可以看出
<23-6,SARA>based on how worn the floor is.

725
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,370
<23-7,ALEXIS>还有声音
<23-7,ALEXIS>And there's the sound.

726
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,250
<23-8,SARA>什么声音
<23-8,SARA>What sound?

727
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,810
<23-8,SARA>没声音
<23-8,SARA>Exactly.

728
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,730
<23-9,ALEXIS>没有汽笛声
<23-9,ALEXIS>No car honks,

729
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,980
<23-9,ALEXIS>没有车辆的噪音
<23-9,ALEXIS>No traffic noise.

730
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,590
<23-9,ALEXIS>要么是这间房间隔音效果好
<23-9,ALEXIS>Either this room is seriously soundproof

731
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,620
<23-9,ALEXIS>要么是我们不在纽约
<23-9,ALEXIS>Or we're not in new york.

732
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,070
<24-1,ESPOSITO>被你说中了
<24-1,ESPOSITO>Looks like your hunch paid off.

733
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,930
<24-1,ESPOSITO>道格拉斯·斯蒂文森
<24-1,ESPOSITO>Douglas Stevens.

734
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,550
<24-1,ESPOSITO>他在一次银行抢劫案中
<24-1,ESPOSITO>He did a nickel as a getaway driver

735
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,390
<24-1,ESPOSITO>充当逃跑汽车的司机
<24-1,ESPOSITO>for a bank robbery.

736
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,560
<24-1,ESPOSITO>猜猜谁是他的同伙
<24-1,ESPOSITO>And guess who did time with him.

737
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,030
<24-1,ESPOSITO>正是罗杰·汉森
<24-1,ESPOSITO>None other than Roger Henson.

738
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,720
<24-2,BECKETT>监狱记录里有他的血型吗
<24-2,BECKETT>Do the prison records show his blood type?

739
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,390
<24-3,ESPOSITO>B型Rh阴性血
<24-3,ESPOSITO>B-negative.

740
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,510
<24-4,BECKETT>我要发出罪犯的全境通告
<24-4,BECKETT>Okay, I'm gonna put out an APB.

741
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,030
<24-4,BECKETT>通知所有医院
<24-4,BECKETT>And alert all hospitals.

742
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,440
<24-4,BECKETT>他失了那么多血
<24-4,BECKETT>With the amount of blood that he lost,

743
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,980
<24-4,BECKETT>一定需要医疗救助
<24-4,BECKETT>he's gonna need medical treatment.

744
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,540
<24-5,RYAN>他也许用不着去医院
<24-5,RYAN>He might not need a hospital.

745
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,880
<24-5,RYAN>道格拉斯·斯蒂文森有个做护士的姐姐
<24-5,RYAN>Douglas Stevens has a sister who's a nurse.

746
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,150
<24-5,RYAN>猜猜今天谁请了病假
<24-5,RYAN>Guess who called in sick today.

<25-1,BECKETT>纽约警察局  开门

<26-3,BECKETT>那所有的罪名就都由你来扛
<26-3,BECKETT>Well, then you're gonna go down for all of it.

<27-9,BECKETT>你查出那个农场是谁的了吗
<27-9,BECKETT>Did you find out who owns the farm?

806
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,640
<27-10,ESPOSITO>没有主人
<27-10,ESPOSITO>Nobody.

<27-11,BECKETT>联调局的人都很厉害
<27-11,BECKETT>Look, the FBI knows what they're doing.

<28-1,HARRIS>Okay, sooner or later someone will show up to bring us more food,

816
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,530
<29-1,ALEXIS>所以我们得做好准备
<29-1,ALEXIS>and we need to be prepared.

817
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,560
<29-1,ALEXIS>安保负责人跟你说什么了
<29-1,ALEXIS>So what did that security guy tell you?

818
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,250
<29-2,SARA>避免跟挟持者有眼神接触
<29-2,SARA>Avoid eye contact with the captor.

819
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,950
<29-2,SARA>那样他们就不会认为你是目击者
<29-2,SARA>So they don't perceive you to be a witness.

820
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,870
<29-3,ALEXIS>很好  还有什么
<29-3,ALEXIS>Good. What else?

821
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,770
<29-4,SARA>装得可怜一些
<29-4,SARA>Be vulnerable.

822
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,620
<29-4,SARA>尽量让劫持者把你当作人来对待
<29-4,SARA>Try to let the captor see you as human,

823
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,510
<29-4,SARA>当作与他们有关的人来对待
<29-4,SARA>as someone they can relate to.

824
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,000
<29-4,SARA>尽量与他们建立信任  建立关系
<29-4,SARA>Try to build up trust, build a relationship.

825
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,270
<29-5,ALEXIS>没有眼神交流又怎么能建立关系呢
<29-5,ALEXIS>How are we supposed to build a relationship without eye contact?

826
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,230
<29-6,SARA>这问题问得好
<29-6,SARA>That's a good question.

827
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,710
<30-1,BECKETT>她一有消息就会告诉你的
<30-1,BECKETT>The minute she knows,you'll know.

828
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,160
<30-2,CASTLE>我想现在就知道
<30-2,CASTLE>I just wish that minute was now.

829
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,510
<30-2,CASTLE>这一切发生得太快又太慢
<30-2,CASTLE>It's all happening too fast and too slow at the same time.

830
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,870
<30-3,BECKETT>你对道格拉斯·斯蒂文森做了什么
<30-3,BECKETT>Tell me what happened with Douglas Stevens.

831
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,380
<30-4,CASTLE>我让他发发慈悲
<30-4,CASTLE>I appealed to his humanity.

832
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,970
<30-5,BECKETT>我没想到你还有这一面
<30-5,BECKETT>I didn't think you had that side to you.

833
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,790
<30-6,CASTLE>涉及到我爱的人  我就会展现出这一面
<30-6,CASTLE>When it comes to the people I love, I do.

834
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,350
<31-1,CAPTOR>把下面的食物托盘推出来
<31-1,CAPTOR>Put the food tray under the door.

835
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,160
<31-2,ALEXIS>我叫阿丽克西斯  这是莎拉
<31-2,ALEXIS>My name's Aexis. This is Sara.

836
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,730
<31-1,CAPTOR>把下面的食物托盘推出来
<31-1,CAPTOR>Put the food tray under the door.

837
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,340
<32-1,ALEXIS>这里有点冷
<32-1,ALEXIS>It's kind of cold in here.

838
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,560
<32-1,ALEXIS>能再给我们几条毯子吗
<32-1,ALEXIS>Is there any way we could get some more blankets?

839
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,340
<32-2,ALEXIS>刚才怎么了
<32-2,ALEXIS>What just happened?

840
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,980
<32-2,ALEXIS>对讲机里的那个人说的是阿拉伯语
<32-2,ALEXIS>That man on the radio, he was speaking arabic.

841
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,110
<32-3,SARA>他说  回到各自岗位  有人来了
<32-3,SARA>He said, "Return to your post. We have visitors. "

842
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,920
<32-3,SARA>冲  冲  冲
<32-3,SARA>Go! Go! Go! Go!

843
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,050
<32-3,SARA>联邦调查局  举起手来
<32-3,SARA>FBI! Hands up!

844
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,750
<32-3,SARA>你知道吗  我还仍然记得
<32-3,SARA>You know, I still remember...

845
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,470
<32-3,SARA>阿丽克西斯刚出生的时候  他们把这个
<32-3,SARA>when Alexis was born, they handed me this...

846
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,840
<34-1,CASTLE>小孩子交给我  她被包裹着
<34-1,CASTLE>tiny person, all bundled up.

847
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,450
<34-1,CASTLE>她  一直盯着我看
<34-1,CASTLE>She just... stared up at me.

848
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:19,050
<34-1,CASTLE>当我也看着她时  有种感觉袭来
<34-1,CASTLE>And when I looked down at her, This feeling hit me...

849
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,740
<34-1,CASTLE>就像是被闪电击中了一样
<34-1,CASTLE>Like I'd been struck by lightning.

850
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,060
<34-1,CASTLE>那就是爱
<34-1,CASTLE>It was love.

851
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,990
<34-1,CASTLE>那一瞬间
<34-1,CASTLE>That instant,

852
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,090
<34-1,CASTLE>我感到了只会对自己孩子产生的无法解释的爱
<34-1,CASTLE>inexplicable love you can only feel for your child.

853
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,230
<34-2,CASTLE>那时我知道
<34-2,CASTLE>In that moment, I knew.

854
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,590
<34-2,CASTLE>我的人生永远改变了
<34-2,CASTLE>I knew my life had changed forever.

855
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,330
<34-2,CASTLE>而现在我的人生又要改变了
<34-2,CASTLE>And now it's about to change again.

856
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,600
<34-2,CASTLE>我是盖茨
<34-2,CASTLE>Gates.

857
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,080
<34-3,GATES>好的
<34-3,GATES>Okay.

858
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,300
<34-3,GATES>农舍是空的
<34-3,GATES>The farmhouse was empty.

859
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,300
<34-4,GATES>阿丽克西斯和莎拉不在那
<34-4,GATES>Alexis and Sara are not there.

860
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,200
<35-1,CASTLE>你确定地下室或者密室里都没有她
<35-1,CASTLE>You're sure she's not in the cellar or some hidden room somewhere?

861
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,390
<35-2,HARRIS>我们都找遍了  她们不在这
<35-2,HARRIS>We searched top to bottom. They're gone.

862
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,610
<35-2,HARRIS>我们倒是发现了这些
<35-2,HARRIS>We did find these.

863
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,500
<35-2,HARRIS>有阿丽克西斯的东西吗
<35-2,HARRIS>Either of 'em belong to Alexis?

864
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,770
<35-3,CASTLE>是的  那是她的
<35-3,CASTLE>Yeah, that one there. That's--that's hers.

865
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,650
<35-3,CASTLE>她的外套在这而人不在这说明了什么
<35-3,CASTLE>What does it mean that her coat's here and she's not?

866
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,050
<35-4,HARRIS>这里一定是个中转站
<35-4,HARRIS>This must have been a way station

867
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,910
<35-4,HARRIS>他们把女孩们带到别处去了
<35-4,HARRIS>until they moved the girls someplace else.

868
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,940
<35-5,BECKETT>他们总是能快我们一步
<35-5,BECKETT>They've been one step ahead of us this whole time.

869
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,500
<35-6,HARRIS>我们对付的这帮人非常老练
<35-6,HARRIS>These people we're dealing with are sophisticated.

870
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,220
<35-6,HARRIS>外面有摄像头
<35-6,HARRIS>There are web cams outside.

871
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,060
<35-6,HARRIS>将我们的行踪暴露给了一个匿名IP
<35-6,HARRIS>Our approach was streamed to an anonymous IP address.

872
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,700
<35-6,HARRIS>也正是这个IP上了你女儿的网站
<35-6,HARRIS>That same IP accessed your daughter's web site.

873
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,680
<35-7,CASTLE>你们无法追踪吗
<35-7,CASTLE>And you can't trace it?

874
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,070
<35-8,HARRIS>踪迹横跨四个洲  很难查到
<35-8,HARRIS>It was routed across four continents. We're not optimistic.

875
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,980
<35-9,BECKETT>那罗杰·汉森呢
<35-9,BECKETT>What about Roger Henson?

876
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,840
<35-10,HARRIS>他被某个知道他们所作所为的人严刑拷打
<35-10,HARRIS>He was shot to death after being tortured at length

877
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,950
<35-10,HARRIS>最后一枪毙命
<35-10,HARRIS>by someone who knew what they were doing.

878
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,880
<35-11,BECKETT>他的指甲被拔了
<35-11,BECKETT>His fingernails were pulled off.

879
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,100
<35-12,CASTLE>我不明白
<35-12,CASTLE>I don't understand.

880
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,320
<35-12,CASTLE>汉森是在为绑架者干活  他们为何拷打他
<35-12,CASTLE>Henson was working for the kidnappers. Why would they torture him?

881
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,780
<35-13,HARRIS>我不知道
<35-13,HARRIS>I don't know.

882
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,560
<35-14,CASTLE>那你觉得是怎么回事呢
<35-14,CASTLE>Well,then what do you think?

883
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,380
<35-14,CASTLE>你猜测呢  这意味着阿丽克西斯会怎样
<35-14,CASTLE>What is your best guess as to what this means for Alexis,

884
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,740
<35-14,CASTLE>她们会怎样
<35-14,CASTLE>for the girls?

885
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,540
<35-15,HARRIS>这意味着  要把她们找回来可不容易
<35-15,HARRIS>It means getting them back may be a little more complicated.

886
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,030
<36-1,ALEXIS>你在里面哭吗
<36-1,ALEXIS>Were you crying in there?

887
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,760
<36-2,SARA>我还以为流水声会盖住呢
<36-2,SARA>I thought the running water would cover it up.

888
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,680
<36-3,ALEXIS>莎拉  我们会没事的
<36-3,ALEXIS>We'll be all right,Sara.

889
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,330
<36-4,SARA>我还以为他们只是要钱
<36-4,SARA>I thought this was all about the money.

890
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,500
<36-4,SARA>但这伙人讲阿拉伯语
<36-4,SARA>But these people speak Arabic.

891
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,520
<36-4,SARA>我爸在埃及敌人很多
<36-4,SARA>My father is a hated man back in Egypt.

892
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,360
<36-5,ALEXIS>我们必须逃出去
<36-5,ALEXIS>We need to get out of here.

893
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,110
<36-6,SARA>那扇门是唯一的出路  可是被锁了
<36-6,SARA>The only way out is through that door, and it's locked.

894
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,830
<36-7,ALEXIS>你这是发夹吗
<36-7,ALEXIS>Hey,are those bobby pins?

895
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,520
<37-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们还是有希望的
<37-1,BECKETT>There are hopeful signs here,Castle.

896
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,020
<37-1,BECKETT>他们并没有伤害女孩们
<37-1,BECKETT>They've gone out of their way not to harm the girls.

897
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,180
<37-1,BECKETT>他们想留活口
<37-1,BECKETT>They want them alive.

898
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,730
<37-1,BECKETT>这会给我们时间来查明幕后黑手
<37-1,BECKETT>That'll give us time to track down whoever's behind this.

899
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,480
<37-1,BECKETT>怎么查
<37-1,BECKETT>How?

900
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,750
<37-2,CASTLE>我们的首要嫌疑人死了
<37-2,CASTLE>Our main suspect is dead,

901
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,900
<37-2,CASTLE>斯蒂文森只知道那农场在哪里  而且
<37-2,CASTLE>The only thing Stevens knew was where the farmhouse is, and...

902
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,190
<37-2,CASTLE>我们根本不知道找的是什么人
<37-2,CASTLE>we have no idea who we're looking for.

903
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,390
<37-3,BECKETT>联邦调查局已经在搜查农场了
<37-3,BECKETT>The FBI is searching the farm for evidence.

904
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,460
<37-3,BECKETT>他们在寻找目击者
<37-3,BECKETT>They're canvassing the area for witnesses

905
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,410
<37-3,BECKETT>也许有人看到是谁在农场里
<37-3,BECKETT>that might have seen whoever was on the property.

906
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,210
<37-4,CASTLE>这些只不过是说明
<37-4,CASTLE>All of which is just another way of saying

907
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,180
<37-4,CASTLE>我们又回到起点了
<37-4,CASTLE>that we're back to square one.

908
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,480
<37-5,BECKETT>不会像之前那样了
<37-5,BECKETT>Won't be the first time.

909
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,150
<37-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们会解决的  会有出路的
<37-5,BECKETT>We're gonna solve this, Castle. We will find a way.

910
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,290
<37-5,BECKETT>"线索更少的情况下我们都办到了"
<37-5,BECKETT>"We've done it before with less to go on. "

911
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,220
<37-5,BECKETT>这是谁教我的
<37-5,BECKETT>You know who told me that?

912
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,430
<37-6,CASTLE>是我
<37-6,CASTLE>I did...

913
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,550
<37-6,CASTLE>我那是盲目乐观
<37-6,CASTLE>In a fit of irrational optimism.

914
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,320
<37-7,BECKETT>去看看你妈妈吧  好好休息  明早再回来
<37-7,BECKETT>Castle, go see your mom. Get some rest. Come back in the morning.

915
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,130
<37-7,BECKETT>没有人放弃
<37-7,BECKETT>No one is giving up here.

916
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,060
<37-8,CASTLE>不行  我不行
<37-8,CASTLE>No, I-I can't. I'm--

917
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,410
<37-9,BECKETT>无咖啡因咖啡
<37-9,BECKETT>Here's a decaf.

918
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,790
<37-9,BECKETT>路上喝
<37-9,BECKETT>It's for the road.

919
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,930
<37-9,BECKETT>谢谢
<37-9,BECKETT>Thank you.

920
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,720
<38-1,SARA>都试了几小时了
<38-1,SARA>It's been hours now.

921
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,690
<38-2,ALEXIS>我爸教过我这个
<38-2,ALEXIS>My dad taught me how to do this

922
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,650
<38-2,ALEXIS>那时他是为写书做研究
<38-2,ALEXIS>when he was researching for one of his books.

923
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,710
<38-2,ALEXIS>他还弄了一扇门让我们练习
<38-2,ALEXIS>He actually bought a door for us to practice on.

924
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,200
<38-3,SARA>这是最近的事吗
<38-3,SARA>This was recently?

925
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,830
<38-4,ALEXIS>是我十岁时
<38-4,ALEXIS>I was 10.

926
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,370
<38-5,SARA>-老天  -我可以的
<38-5,SARA>- Oh,god. - I can do this.

927
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,490
<38-6,ALEXIS>一根发夹扳着锁孔
<38-6,ALEXIS>One bobby pin is the torsion wrench,

928
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,230
<38-6,ALEXIS>另一根用来撬锁
<38-6,ALEXIS>the other is the lockpick.

929
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,550
<38-6,ALEXIS>我只要小心控制好力度就行
<38-6,ALEXIS>I just need to be careful not to apply too much pressure.

930
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,620
<38-7,SARA>你这是把发夹扳断了吗  那可是最后一根
<38-7,SARA>Did you just break the hairpin? Because that's the last one.

931
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,300
<38-8,ALEXIS>不  我成功了
<38-8,ALEXIS>No. I got it.

932
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,120
<38-9,SARA>谢天谢地
<38-9,SARA>Oh, my god.

933
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,910
<38-10,SARA>外面是什么
<38-10,SARA>What's out there?

934
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,810
<38-11,ALEXIS>走廊  像是栋写字楼
<38-11,ALEXIS>A hallway. Like in an office building.

935
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,720
<38-11,ALEXIS>我没看见有人
<38-11,ALEXIS>I don't see anyone.

936
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,540
<38-12,SARA>万一被抓住了怎么办
<38-12,SARA>What if they catch us,then what?

937
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,070
<38-12,SARA>他们想我们活着  记住这个就好
<38-12,SARA>They want us alive. Just remember that.

938
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,460
<38-13,ALEXIS>这么办  我们穿过走廊  那边一定有出路
<38-13,ALEXIS>Here's the plan-- we head down the hall. There has to be a way out.

939
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,530
<38-13,ALEXIS>如果走廊有两个方向
<38-13,ALEXIS>If it looks like there's two ways,

940
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,950
<38-13,ALEXIS>我们就分头跑  这样总有一个能跑出去
<38-13,ALEXIS>we split up and double our chances that one of us makes it out.

941
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,080
<38-14,SARA>我紧张得想吐了
<38-14,SARA>I think I'm gonna throw up.

942
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,370
<38-15,ALEXIS>你不会吐的
<38-15,ALEXIS>You're not going to throw up.

943
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,710
<38-15,ALEXIS>你会逃出去的
<38-15,ALEXIS>You're going to get out of here.

944
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,740
<38-16,SARA>好  好
<38-16,SARA>Okay. Okay.

946
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,570
<38-19,ALEXIS>我们说好的  行动
<38-19,ALEXIS>We talked about this. Go.

947
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,840
<39-1,FBI TECH GUY>你和别人约了视频聊天吗
<39-1,FBI TECH GUY>Are you expecting someone to skype you?

948
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
<38-18,SARA>没有
<38-18,SARA>No.

949
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,860
<39-4,ALEXIS>-阿丽克西斯  -爸爸
<39-4,ALEXIS>- Alexis. - Daddy?

950
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,680
<39-5,ALEXIS>谢天谢地  我想报警  可是打不通
<39-5,ALEXIS>Oh,my god. I tried to call 9-1-1 but it wouldn't go through.

951

<39-6,CASTLE>我不知道
<39-6,CASTLE>I don't know.

953
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,850
<39-7,ALEXIS>坏了  这电话要没电了
<39-7,ALEXIS>Oh, no. The phone's about to die.

954
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,910
<39-7,ALEXIS>我们在一栋大楼里
<39-7,ALEXIS>Um, I--we're--we're-- we're in some building.

955

<39-7,ALEXIS>我们被锁在一个房间里  但逃出来了
<39-7,ALEXIS>We were locked in a room but we got out.

<39-8,CASTLE>Where? What building? What's out-- what's outside the window?

957
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,040
<39-9,ALEXIS>什么都没有  我看不见  窗户都被遮住了
<39-9,ALEXIS>Nothing. Nothing. I can't see anything. The windows are covered up.

958
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,650
<39-10,ALEXIS>他们来了  他们发现我们跑了
<39-10,ALEXIS>They're coming. They're coming. They found out we're gone.

959
