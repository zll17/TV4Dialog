29
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,180
<1-1,CASTLE>这边门打不开了
<1-1,CASTLE>This door won't open.

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,460
<1-2,BECKETT>我这边也是
<1-2,BECKETT>Yeah, mine won't either.

31
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,030
<1-2,BECKETT>门框被撞变形了
<1-2,BECKETT>I think the crash bent the frame.

32
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,400
<1-3,CASTLE>我们得找点东西把玻璃打碎
<1-3,CASTLE>We need something to break the glass.

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,480
<1-4,BECKETT>我的枪
<1-4,BECKETT>My gun.

34
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,940
<1-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我
<1-5,BECKETT>Castle, I can't...

35
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,790
<1-5,BECKETT>我找不到
<1-5,BECKETT>I can't find it.

36
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,460
<1-5,BECKETT>可能是我们撞车的时候被撞飞了
<1-5,BECKETT>I-I think it got knocked out when we got hit.

37
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,790
<1-5,BECKETT>帮我找找
<1-5,BECKETT>Help me look for it.

38
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,060
<1-6,BECKETT>我被卡住了
<1-6,BECKETT>I'm stuck.

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,230
<1-7,CASTLE>什么叫你被卡住了
<1-7,CASTLE>What do you mean, you're stuck?

40
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,720
<1-8,BECKETT>我的安全带打不开了
<1-8,BECKETT>I mean, my belt is jammed.

41
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,540
<1-8,BECKETT>座位也动不了
<1-8,BECKETT>And the seat won't move.

42
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,180
<1-9,CASTLE>刀子呢  你有刀吗
<1-9,CASTLE>Okay, what about a knife? Do you have a knife?

43
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,350
<1-9,CASTLE>有
<1-9,CASTLE>Yeah.

44
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,960
<1-10,BECKETT>在后车厢里
<1-10,BECKETT>In the trunk.

45
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,080
<1-11,BECKETT>听着  我们没时间了
<1-11,BECKETT>Okay, look, we're running out of time.

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,160
<1-11,BECKETT>你得看看能不能找到枪
<1-11,BECKETT>I need you to see if you can find that gun,

47
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,190
<1-11,BECKETT>然后我们把安全打断
<1-11,BECKETT>and we'll just shoot the belt off.

48
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,250
<1-12,CASTLE>我摸不到
<1-12,CASTLE>I can't feel it.

49
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,440
<1-14,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -等等  等等
<1-14,CASTLE>- Castle. - Okay, hang on. Hang on.

50
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,010
<1-15,BECKETT>待着别动
<1-15,BECKETT>Okay. Just stay here.

59
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,760
<1-17,CASTLE>我找到了
<1-17,CASTLE>I found it.

60
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,850
<1-12,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<1-12,CASTLE>Castle?

61
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,650
<1-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<1-13,BECKETT>Castle!

62
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,460
<2-1,CASTLE>我想有女儿在犯罪现场的好处
<2-1,CASTLE>I guess the good thing about having your daughter at crime scenes is,

63
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,770
<2-1,CASTLE>就是她能给你带干衣服
<2-1,CASTLE>she can bring you dry clothes.

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,590
<2-2,BECKETT>谢了
<2-2,BECKETT>Thanks.

65
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,040
<2-2,BECKETT>还有
<2-2,BECKETT>And, um...

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,690
<2-2,BECKETT>谢谢
<2-2,BECKETT>Thanks.

67
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,530
<2-3,CASTLE>你也会为我这么做的
<2-3,CASTLE>You'd have done the same for me.

68
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,410
<2-3,CASTLE>是啊
<2-3,CASTLE>Yeah.

69
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,620
<2-4,BECKETT>可能吧
<2-4,BECKETT>Probably.

70
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,690
<2-5,BECKETT>我只是庆幸你找到了我的枪
<2-5,BECKETT>I'm just glad you found my gun.

71
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,930
<2-6,CASTLE>车掉水里这种桥段
<2-6,CASTLE>That whole, uh, sinking car thing--

72
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,800
<2-6,CASTLE>看电影比亲身体验爽多了
<2-6,CASTLE>much cooler in movies than it is in real life.

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
<2-7,BECKETT>我也想说  我还是更喜欢间谍片而不是参与其中
<2-7,BECKETT>And for the record, I prefer watching spy thrillers to being in them.

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
<2-7,BECKETT>好吧
<2-7,BECKETT>So...

75
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,730
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>老实交代
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Tell me...

76
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,760
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>为什么死者长得那么像
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>How can your victim look like Nelson Blakely

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,020
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>本应死了十年的尼尔森·布莱克利
<2-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>when he supposedly died ten years ago?

78
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,210
<2-9,BECKETT>是啊  我
<2-9,BECKETT>Yeah, I...

79
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,680
<2-10,CASTLE>是啊  很奇怪不是吗
<2-10,CASTLE>Yeah, weird, isn't it?

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,940
<2-11,ESPOSITO>是  奇了怪了
<2-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Weird.

81
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,850
<2-11,ESPOSITO>假死  汽车落水
<2-11,ESPOSITO>Fake deaths, car in the water--

82
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,070
<2-11,ESPOSITO>你们就不觉得现在
<2-11,ESPOSITO>Don't you think now is a good time

83
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,910
<2-11,ESPOSITO>应该告诉我们到底怎么回事吗
<2-11,ESPOSITO>to tell us what the hell is going on?

84
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,620
<2-13,BECKETT>不好意思  哈维尔
<2-13,BECKETT>Uh... I'm sorry, Javi.

85
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,050
<2-13,BECKETT>机密行动
<2-13,BECKETT>It's classified.

86
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,950
<2-14,ESPOSITO>我在特种部队待过
<2-14,ESPOSITO>I was special forces.

87
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,890
<2-14,ESPOSITO>机密行动以前是我的家常便饭
<2-14,ESPOSITO>I used to eat classified for breakfast.

88
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,540
<2-14,ESPOSITO>这个作家小子为什么就能知道
<2-14,ESPOSITO>And yet writer boy can know?

89
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,800
<2-14,ESPOSITO>好吧  我去那边跟海港巡逻队一起
<2-14,ESPOSITO>Okay. I'll be over there with harbor patrol

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,010
<2-14,ESPOSITO>看怎么把你的车从水里捞出来
<2-14,ESPOSITO>trying to figure out how to get your unit out of the drink.

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,570
<2-14,ESPOSITO>很高兴你们没事
<2-14,ESPOSITO>I'm glad you're okay.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,950
<2-15,BECKETT>谢谢
<2-15,BECKETT>Thank you.

93
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,150
<2-17,CASTLE>作家小子
<2-17,CASTLE>Writer boy?

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,340
<2-17,CASTLE>-你觉得凶手是盖奇  -对
<2-17,CASTLE>- So you think our shooter was Gage? - Yeah.

95
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,560
<2-18,BECKETT>我觉得他在除掉每一个
<2-18,BECKETT>I think he's getting rid of anyone

96
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,330
<2-18,BECKETT>会暴露他变节行动的人
<2-18,BECKETT>that could expose his rogue operations.

97
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,410
<2-19,CASTLE>他干的真是不错啊
<2-19,CASTLE>Well, he's doing a pretty good job.

98
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,100
<2-19,CASTLE>我们到现在都不知道潘朵拉是什么
<2-19,CASTLE>We still have no idea what Pandora is.

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,580
<2-20,BECKETT>我们知道布莱克利害怕了
<2-20,BECKETT>Well, we know that Blakely was afraid.

100
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,240
<2-20,BECKETT>我们也知道他在进行一些
<2-20,BECKETT>And we know that he was working on something

101
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,350
<2-20,BECKETT>足以威胁国家未来的研究
<2-20,BECKETT>that was big enough to threaten the future of this country.

102
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,060
<2-21,CASTLE>我们只是不知道他在研究什么
<2-21,CASTLE>We just don't know what the hell he was working on.

103
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,000
<2-22,BECKETT>他的生活中一定有些线索
<2-22,BECKETT>There's gotta be a clue somewhere in his life.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,910
<2-22,BECKETT>或许他尸体能泄露点玄机
<2-22,BECKETT>Maybe there's something on the body that will tell us.

105
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,310
<3-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>不  我们检查过了  他兜里什么都没有
<3-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>No. We checked. There was nothing in his pockets.

106
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,120
<3-2,LANIE PARISH>不过从衣兜被翻出来的样子可以猜测
<3-2,LANIE PARISH>But the way they were turned out makes me think

107
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
<3-2,LANIE PARISH>有人翻找过并把里面的东西拿走了
<3-2,LANIE PARISH>someone went through and emptied them.

108
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,970
<3-3,CASTLE>盖奇
<3-3,CASTLE>Gage.

109
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,890
<3-4,BECKETT>莱恩  找人搜查一下建筑物
<3-4,BECKETT>Ryan, get some teams to search the building.

110
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,210
<3-5,KEVIN RYAN>-我们要找什么  -我也不知道
<3-5,KEVIN RYAN>- What are we looking for? - I don't know.

111
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,940
<3-6,BECKETT>但是他带我们过来总是有原因的
<3-6,BECKETT>But he brought us here for a reason.

112
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,440
<3-6,BECKETT>蕾妮  你能不能从他身上发现点什么
<3-6,BECKETT>Lanie, see what you can find on him--

113
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,750
<3-6,BECKETT>牙齿  伤疤  指纹  纹身
<3-6,BECKETT>Dental, scars, prints, tattoos,

114
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,760
<3-6,BECKETT>任何能告诉我们
<3-6,BECKETT>anything that might tell us--

115
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,030
<3-7,SOPHIA TURNER>-他死了  -是啊
<3-7,SOPHIA TURNER>- He's dead. - Yeah.

116
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,350
<3-8,CASTLE>听着  我能解释
<3-8,CASTLE>Look, I can explain.

117
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,730
<3-9,SOPHIA>上车
<3-9,SOPHIA>Get in the car.

118
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,840
<4-1,SOPHIA>你们在做什么
<4-1,SOPHIA>What the hell did you think you were doing?

119
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,810
<4-2,CASTLE>你想让我们做的  找布莱克利
<4-2,CASTLE>What you wanted, finding Blakely.

120
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,180
<4-3,SOPHIA>你破解了他的密码就不想着来告诉我一声吗
<4-3,SOPHIA>You cracked his code and you didn't even think to notify me?

121
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,510
<4-4,BECKETT>我得为卡塞尔说句话
<4-4,BECKETT>Look, in Castle's defense,

122
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,640
<4-4,BECKETT>这事希望渺茫
<4-4,BECKETT>it was a long shot,

123
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,960
<4-4,BECKETT>他不想自己判断错误而浪费了你的时间
<4-4,BECKETT>and he didn't want to waste your time if he was wrong.

124
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,930
<4-4,BECKETT>何况当时我们正要带他过来
<4-4,BECKETT>And we were bringing the guy in...

125
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,790
<4-5,SOPHIA>却被人杀了  还是在你的监护下
<4-5,SOPHIA>When he was killed, in your custody.

126
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,150
<4-6,DANBERG>你们在码头做什么
<4-6,DANBERG>What were you doing at the docks?

127
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,100
<4-7,CASTLE>-他让我们带他去的  -为什么
<4-7,CASTLE>- He asked us to take him there. - Why?

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,290
<4-9,BECKETT>我们不知道
<4-9,BECKETT>We don't know.

129
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,210
<4-10,SOPHIA>你们问出任何事来了吗
<4-10,SOPHIA>Well, did you learn anything?

130
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,190
<4-10,SOPHIA>问出来了
<4-10,SOPHIA>Yes.

131
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,980
<4-11,CASTLE>他受雇分析美国的弱点
<4-11,CASTLE>He was hired to analyze the United States for vulnerabilities.

132
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,640
<4-11,CASTLE>他说他发现了经济方面的一个漏洞
<4-11,CASTLE>He said he found a weakness in our economy--

133
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,790
<4-11,CASTLE>一个令人意想不到的关键
<4-11,CASTLE>an unexpected linchpin--that,

134
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,290
<4-11,CASTLE>如果有人攻击此处  多米诺骨牌就会接连倒下
<4-11,CASTLE>if someone went after it, would start the dominos falling.

135
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,520
<4-12,SOPHIA>会引发什么后果
<4-12,SOPHIA>Falling toward what?

136
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,520
<4-13,BECKETT>给国家带来毁灭
<4-13,BECKETT>The end of our country as we know it.

137
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,120
<4-14,CASTLE>那我们下一步做什么
<4-14,CASTLE>So what's our next move?

138
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,900
<4-14,CASTLE>没有下一步了
<4-14,CASTLE>There is no next move.

139
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,590
<4-14,CASTLE>至少你们俩没有
<4-14,CASTLE>Not for you two.

140
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,990
<4-15,SOPHIA>让你们参与此事就是个错误
<4-15,SOPHIA>It was a mistake bringing you into the loop.

141
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,990
<4-15,SOPHIA>我本来以为
<4-15,SOPHIA>You know, I really thought--

142
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,580
<4-15,SOPHIA>我以为你有改变
<4-15,SOPHIA>I really thought you had changed.

143
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,230
<4-15,SOPHIA>结果呢
<4-15,SOPHIA>But you know what?

144
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,330
<4-15,SOPHIA>你还跟以前一样
<4-15,SOPHIA>You are the same reckless,

145
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,760
<4-15,SOPHIA>是个鲁莽  幼稚  自我为中心的混蛋
<4-15,SOPHIA>immature, self-centered jackass that you always were,

146
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,230
<4-15,SOPHIA>你将整个调查置于危险之中
<4-15,SOPHIA>and you've put this investigation at risk.

147
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,450
<4-16,CASTLE>-对不起  -对不起
<4-16,CASTLE>- Look, I'm sorry- - You're sorry?

148
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,980
<4-17,SOPHIA>我们面临的是下一个911  或许更糟
<4-17,SOPHIA>We are on the verge of the next 9/11 or worse.

149
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,450
<4-17,SOPHIA>这不是你写的书  里克
<4-17,SOPHIA>This isn't one of your damn books, Rick.

150
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,540
<4-17,SOPHIA>这是真实生活  如果出了问题
<4-17,SOPHIA>This is real life, and when things go bad,

151
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,320
<4-17,SOPHIA>你不能像对我们的事那样改写个结局了事
<4-17,SOPHIA>you can't just rewrite the ending like you did with us.

152
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,030
<4-18,SOPHIA>把他们带出去
<4-18,SOPHIA>Get them both out of here.

153
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,740
<5-1,BECKETT>这么说  你跟她睡过了
<5-1,BECKETT>So...You slept with her.

154
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,600
<5-2,CASTLE>是是  我跟她睡了
<5-2,CASTLE>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I slept with her.

155
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,160
<5-3,BECKETT>还有别人吗
<5-3,BECKETT>Have there been others?

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
<5-4,CASTLE>-女人吗  -你的缪斯
<5-4,CASTLE>- Women? - Muses.

157
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,690
<5-6,CASTLE>没了  怎么
<5-6,CASTLE>No. Why?

158
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,150
<5-7,BECKETT>我就想看看缪斯俱乐部到底有多少人
<5-7,BECKETT>I just wanted to see how big the club was. That's all.

159
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,020
<5-7,BECKETT>同志们  有进展吗
<5-7,BECKETT>Hey, guys. What do you got?

160
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,300
<5-8,CASTLE>首先  根本就没有这么个俱乐部
<5-8,CASTLE>First off, there is no club.

161
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,910
<5-8,CASTLE>其次  我们不跟这个案子了  记得吗
<5-8,CASTLE>And second, we're off the case if you recall.

162
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,470
<5-9,BECKETT>是不跟他们查了  我自己还有个凶杀案
<5-9,BECKETT>We're off their case. I still have a murder to solve.

163
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,830
<5-10,CASTLE>可你的主要嫌疑犯恰好
<5-10,CASTLE>Where your chief suspect

164
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,890
<5-10,CASTLE>是中情局行动中牵涉到的人
<5-10,CASTLE>is smack-dab in the middle of a CIA operation.

165
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,750
<5-11,BECKETT>我才不管他牵涉到哪里
<5-11,BECKETT>I don't care what he's in the middle of.

166
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,810
<5-11,BECKETT>托马斯·盖奇杀了三个人
<5-11,BECKETT>Thomas Gage killed three people.

167
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,670
<5-11,BECKETT>其中一人当时还是由我监护
<5-11,BECKETT>One of them was in my custody.

168
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,650
<5-11,BECKETT>他把我们关在车后备箱里
<5-11,BECKETT>He locked us in a trunk

169
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,900
<5-11,BECKETT>他还把我的警车撞进了哈德逊河里
<5-11,BECKETT>and then he sent my cruiser to the bottom of the Hudson.

170
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,040
<5-12,CASTLE>盖奇是个训练有素的秘密特工
<5-12,CASTLE>Gage is a trained covert operative.

171
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,670
<5-12,CASTLE>你不可能抓到他的
<5-12,CASTLE>There's no way you can catch him.

172
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,310
<5-13,BECKETT>我可以  只要想出来他下面会去哪
<5-13,BECKETT>Yes, I can, if I figure out where he was going.

173
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,420
<5-13,BECKETT>我们查明布莱克利在研究什么
<5-13,BECKETT>We find out what Blakely was working on,

174
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,210
<5-13,BECKETT>从而找到那个关键点
<5-13,BECKETT>we find the linchpin.

175
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,720
<5-13,BECKETT>找到关键点  就能找到盖奇
<5-13,BECKETT>We find the linchpin, we find Gage.

176
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,440
<5-14,BECKETT>在仓库找到什么了吗
<5-14,BECKETT>Anything on the warehouse?

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,580
<5-15,RYAN>有啊  你们俩走了之后  联调局的人来了
<5-15,RYAN>Yeah, right after you guys left, the feds showed up

178
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,420
<5-15,RYAN>中止了我们的调查
<5-15,RYAN>and shut us down.

179
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,440
<5-16,ESPOSITO>不过我们查到了死者尼尔森·布莱克利的一些信息
<5-16,ESPOSITO>But we did find something on your vic Nelson Blakely.

180
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,040
<5-16,ESPOSITO>他的指纹和长岛的斯科特·麦克格雷格相吻合
<5-16,ESPOSITO>His prints came back as a Scott McGregor from long island city.

181
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,330
<5-17,RYAN>问题是  这个麦克格雷格貌似只存在于文件上
<5-17,RYAN>Problem is, McGregor seems to only exist on paper.

182
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,000
<5-17,RYAN>我们在现实世界里查不到他的踪迹
<5-17,RYAN>We can't find any trace of him in the real world.

183
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,190
<5-18,BECKETT>你们派人去列出的地址盘查了吗
<5-18,BECKETT>Did you guys send units to the listed address?

184
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,690
<5-19,RYAN>去了  住在那的人说从没听说过他
<5-19,RYAN>Yeah, and the family living there had never heard of him,

185
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,020
<5-19,RYAN>也没人认得他的照片
<5-19,RYAN>and no one recognized his photo.

186
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,700
<5-20,BECKETT>肯定有人认识他
<5-20,BECKETT>Well, someone must have known him.

187
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,690
<5-21,CASTLE>是有人认识
<5-21,CASTLE>Someone did.

188
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,470
<5-21,CASTLE>他玩象棋  象棋没法一个人玩
<5-21,CASTLE>He plays chess. That's not a solo sport.

189
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,040
<5-22,BECKETT>你不是不跟这案子了吗
<5-22,BECKETT>I thought you were off the case.

190
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,670
<5-23,CASTLE>你听到索菲亚怎么说我的了
<5-23,CASTLE>Well, you heard what Sophia said.

191
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,020
<5-23,CASTLE>一个鲁莽  幼稚  自我为中心的混蛋
<5-23,CASTLE>I'm a reckless, immature, self-centered jackass.

192
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,180
<5-23,CASTLE>如果你固执到一定要继续查的地步
<5-23,CASTLE>If you're stubborn enough to keep going,

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,110
<5-23,CASTLE>那我就笨到跟着你继续的地步
<5-23,CASTLE>I'm stupid enough to go with you.

194
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,950
<5-24,BECKETT>好吧  你们去排查一下城里所有的象棋公园
<5-24,BECKETT>All right. You guys canvass all of the chess parks in the city.

195
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,390
<5-24,BECKETT>看看能不能找到跟他对过弈的人
<5-24,BECKETT>Let's see if we can dig up some of his opponents.

197
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,490
<5-24,BECKETT>什么
<5-24,BECKETT>What?

198
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,450
<5-25,BECKETT>什么叫"尸体就没来"
<5-25,BECKETT>What do you mean, the body never arrived?

199
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,080
<6-1,LANIE>他们中途把尸体拦截了
<6-1,LANIE>They intercepted it at transport.

200
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,880
<6-1,LANIE>他们申请到了法院指令
<6-1,LANIE>Apparently, they had a court order.

201
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,330
<6-2,CASTLE>不可能
<6-2,CASTLE>That's impossible.

202
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,830
<6-2,CASTLE>怎么可能这么快就申请到法院指令
<6-2,CASTLE>How could they get a court order that fast?

203
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,010
<6-3,BECKETT>我怎么知道  要不你去问问你女朋友
<6-3,BECKETT>I don't know. Maybe you should ask your girlfriend.

204
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,890
<6-4,LANIE>女朋友
<6-4,LANIE>Girlfriend?

205
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,140
<6-5,CASTLE>行了吧  我们确实一起睡了
<6-5,CASTLE>Yes, okay. We slept together.

206
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,010
<6-5,CASTLE>但那是很久以前了  有什么大不了的
<6-5,CASTLE>It was a long time ago. What's the big deal?

207
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,860
<6-6,BECKETT>没什么  爱跟谁睡跟谁睡
<6-6,BECKETT>There is no big deal. Sleep with whoever you want.

208
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,660
<6-6,BECKETT>多多益善
<6-6,BECKETT>The more the merrier.

209
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,860
<6-7,ALEXIS>我把毒物检测报告拿来了
<6-7,ALEXIS>I have those, uh, toxicology reports you wanted.

210
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,730
<6-8,LANIE>好  放那儿吧  亲爱的
<6-8,LANIE>Oh, yes. Just set 'em there, sweetie.

211
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,790
<6-8,LANIE>谢谢
<6-8,LANIE>Thank you.

212
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,660
<7-1,CASTLE>你喜欢你的新实习吧
<7-1,CASTLE>So enjoying your new internship?

213
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,150
<7-2,ALEXIS>我了解到了很多新东西
<7-2,ALEXIS>Well, I'm learning a lot.

214
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,960
<7-3,CASTLE>了解得太多了
<7-3,CASTLE>Too much I think.

215
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,080
<7-4,ALEXIS>我还以为最恶心的部分会是死尸呢
<7-4,ALEXIS>And I thought the dead bodies were going to be the grossest part.

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,440
<7-5,CASTLE>真幽默  晚安
<7-5,CASTLE>Funny. Good night.

217
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,180
<7-6,ALEXIS>那么贝克特说的是谁
<7-6,ALEXIS>So who was Beckett talking about?

218
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,400
<7-7,CASTLE>跟你无关  快去睡觉
<7-7,CASTLE>None of your business. Now go to bed.

219
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,550
<7-8,ALEXIS>在码头出现的那个女的是谁
<7-8,ALEXIS>The woman at the docks, who is she?

220
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,630
<7-9,CASTLE>不是谁
<7-9,CASTLE>Nobody.

221
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,340
<7-9,CASTLE>快去睡觉
<7-9,CASTLE>Now go to bed.

222
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,860
<7-10,ALEXIS>我看到你看她的眼神了
<7-10,ALEXIS>I saw the way you looked at her.

223
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,870
<7-10,ALEXIS>她绝不是一般人
<7-10,ALEXIS>She's not nobody.

224
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,630
<7-11,CASTLE>她是谁都无所谓
<7-11,CASTLE>Well, it doesn't matter who she is

225
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,190
<7-11,CASTLE>反正我们不会再见面了
<7-11,CASTLE>because I am never going to see her again.

226
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,960
<7-11,CASTLE>现在快去睡觉吧
<7-11,CASTLE>Now go to bed.

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,110
<7-12,ALEXIS>要知道  你要是这么对我遮遮掩掩的
<7-12,ALEXIS>You know, if you're going to keep secrets from me,

228
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,040
<7-12,ALEXIS>我或许也会开始对你有所隐瞒
<7-12,ALEXIS>I might start keeping secrets from you, too.

229
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,630
<7-13,CASTLE>你这年纪  瞒着爸爸点事也挺好的
<7-13,CASTLE>At your age, I'm thinking, that might be a good idea.

230
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,390
<7-14,CASTLE>索菲亚
<7-14,CASTLE>Sophia.

231
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,250
<7-15,SOPHIA>晚上好  里克
<7-15,SOPHIA>Hello, Rick.

241
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,980
<8-1,CASTLE>你怎么  做什么  你怎么进来的
<8-1,CASTLE>How--what are you--how did-- how did you get in here?

242
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,290
<8-2,SOPHIA>我是中情局特工
<8-2,SOPHIA>I'm CIA.

243
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,860
<8-3,SOPHIA>你的小说现在还改编成漫画了
<8-3,SOPHIA>So they're turning them into graphic novels now?

244
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,160
<8-4,CASTLE>是的
<8-4,CASTLE>Yeah. Um...

245
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
<8-4,CASTLE>第一本反响不错  他们还要改编一部
<8-4,CASTLE>The first one did well, so they're gonna do another.

246
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,760
<8-5,SOPHIA>你觉得怎么样  她看上去像我吗
<8-5,SOPHIA>So what do you think, she look like me?

247
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,980
<29-15,CASTLE>你到底来做什么
<29-15,CASTLE>Uh... What are you doing here?

248
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,280
<8-7,SOPHIA>你们还在追查盖奇不是吗
<8-7,SOPHIA>You're going after Gage, aren't you?

249
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,980
<8-8,CASTLE>没有  我们不能跟这个案子了  记得吗
<8-8,CASTLE>No. We're off the case, remember?

250
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,150
<8-9,SOPHIA>还是过去的你更善于说谎
<8-9,SOPHIA>Mm. You used to be a better liar.

251
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,070
<8-9,SOPHIA>我知道你们在查布莱克利的化名
<8-9,SOPHIA>I know you've been looking into Blakely's aliases.

252
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,870
<8-10,SOPHIA>没关系  里克  我不介意
<8-10,SOPHIA>It's okay, Rick. I don't mind.

253
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,370
<8-10,SOPHIA>事实上  我希望你继续追查这个案子
<8-10,SOPHIA>In fact, I want you on this case.

254
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,240
<8-12,SOPHIA>-但  -我知道我说过什么
<8-12,SOPHIA>- But... -I know what I said,

255
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,280
<8-12,SOPHIA>但我也知道事关重大
<8-12,SOPHIA>but I also know what's at stake.

256
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,640
<8-12,SOPHIA>之前让你和贝克特加入调查
<8-12,SOPHIA>Bringing you and Beckett on board

257
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,930
<8-12,SOPHIA>并不是一个很受欢迎的决定
<8-12,SOPHIA>was not a popular decision,

258
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,360
<8-12,SOPHIA>而且由于布莱克利的死  我得表明立场
<8-12,SOPHIA>and after what happened with Blakely, I had to make a stand.

259
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,770
<8-12,SOPHIA>但是我知道你的能力
<8-12,SOPHIA>But I know what kind of asset you can be.

260
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,060
<8-12,SOPHIA>我知道不管我说什么你都会继续追查下去
<8-12,SOPHIA>I know you'll just keep digging no matter what I say.

261
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,320
<8-12,SOPHIA>这是你的天性
<8-12,SOPHIA>It's your nature.

262
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,860
<8-12,SOPHIA>你总得知道故事会有怎样的结局
<8-12,SOPHIA>You need to know how the story ends.

263
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,980
<8-13,SOPHIA>就像她的故事一样
<8-13,SOPHIA>Like with her.

264
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,550
<8-13,SOPHIA>她知道这些吗
<8-13,SOPHIA>Does she know about this?

265
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,540
<8-14,CASTLE>那是...
<8-14,CASTLE>Well, that's...

266
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,760
<8-15,SOPHIA>你总是喜欢玩危险游戏
<8-15,SOPHIA>You always did like playing with dynamite.

267
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,650
<8-15,SOPHIA>只是小心别玩火自焚
<8-15,SOPHIA>Just be careful it doesn't blow up in your face.

268
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,470
<8-16,CASTLE>她与众不同
<8-16,CASTLE>She's different.

269
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,530
<8-16,CASTLE>是吗
<8-16,CASTLE>Is she?

270
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,630
<8-17,SOPHIA>还是只是你一厢情愿
<8-17,SOPHIA>Or do you just think she is?

271
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,970
<8-18,SOPHIA>听说你们和我们一样查布莱克利进了死胡同
<8-18,SOPHIA>I heard you hit the same dead end with Blakely as we did.

272
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,640
<8-18,SOPHIA>我想你们或许可以试一下这条线索
<8-18,SOPHIA>I thought you might be able to try this.

273
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,700
<8-18,SOPHIA>这就是布莱克利去码头要找的东西
<8-18,SOPHIA>It's what Blakely was looking for at the pier.

274
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,320
<8-18,SOPHIA>我们是在一个放着机票  现金和假身份证的
<8-18,SOPHIA>We found it in a go bag with plane tickets, cash,

275
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,890
<8-18,SOPHIA>冲锋包里找到的
<8-18,SOPHIA>and some fake I.D.S.

276
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,930
<8-19,CASTLE>银行账号
<8-19,CASTLE>Account numbers?

277
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,230
<8-20,SOPHIA>全都是国内银行的
<8-20,SOPHIA>All from domestic banks.

278
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,640
<8-20,SOPHIA>鉴于布莱克利是美国公民
<8-20,SOPHIA>And since Blakely was a U.S. Citizen--

279
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,930
<8-21,CASTLE>你们没有权力继续调查他
<8-21,CASTLE>You're prohibited from looking into them.

280
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,780
<8-22,SOPHIA>但是你们有
<8-22,SOPHIA>But you guys aren't.

281
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,220
<8-22,SOPHIA>这些帐号可能指向他的雇主的身份
<8-22,SOPHIA>And those accounts may contain clues as to who hired him.

282
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,070
<8-22,SOPHIA>我想你仍然好奇故事的结局吧
<8-22,SOPHIA>And assuming you still want to know how the story ends...

283
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,980
<8-23,SOPHIA>只是这一次务必及时向我通报消息
<8-23,SOPHIA>Just keep me in the loop this time.

284
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,100
<8-23,SOPHIA>还有  里克
<8-23,SOPHIA>And, Rick...

285
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,960
<8-23,SOPHIA>尽量保住自己的性命
<8-23,SOPHIA>Try not to get killed.

286
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,770
<8-23,SOPHIA>我还是挺喜欢你的
<8-23,SOPHIA>I'm still quite fond of you.

287
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,810
<9-1,CASTLE>小伙子们都去哪儿了
<9-1,CASTLE>Where are the boys?

288
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,020
<9-2,BECKETT>他们在象棋公园做排查
<9-2,BECKETT>They're canvassing chess parks,

289
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,880
<9-2,BECKETT>看看有没有人认识布莱克利
<9-2,BECKETT>looking for anyone that knew Blakely.

290
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,920
<9-3,CASTLE>你为什么没有跟他们一起去
<9-3,CASTLE>And why aren't you with them?

291
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,140
<9-4,BECKETT>因为我的车正躺在哈德逊河河底
<9-4,BECKETT>Because my car is at the bottom of the Hudson,

292
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,600
<9-4,BECKETT>而且除非我上交事故报告
<9-4,BECKETT>and Gates won't issue me another one

293
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,790
<9-4,BECKETT>盖茨就不肯给我配辆新车
<9-4,BECKETT>until I write up an incident report,

294
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,570
<9-4,BECKETT>可是这案子是机密所以我又不能写报告
<9-4,BECKETT>which I can't do because this case is classified.

295
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,170
<9-6,BECKETT>你笑什么
<9-6,BECKETT>What?

296
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,280
<9-6,BECKETT>没什么
<9-6,BECKETT>Nothing.

297
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,670
<9-7,CASTLE>只是  真是一个关键理论的绝佳例证
<9-7,CASTLE>It's just, that's a perfect example of a linchpin.

298
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,890
<9-7,CASTLE>这个案子可能永远不能侦破就因为
<9-7,CASTLE>This case might go unsolved all because

299
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,550
<9-7,CASTLE>你拿不到一辆车
<9-7,CASTLE>you don't have access to a car.

300
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,250
<9-8,BECKETT>不要逼我开枪打你
<9-8,BECKETT>Don't make me shoot you.

301
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,020
<9-9,CASTLE>如果你真开枪打我
<9-9,CASTLE>Well, if you shoot me,

302
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,620
<9-9,CASTLE>谁来帮你追查这条线索
<9-9,CASTLE>who's gonna help you follow this lead?

303
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,230
<9-9,CASTLE>布莱克利的银行账户信息
<9-9,CASTLE>Blakely's bank account information.

304
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,690
<9-9,CASTLE>这就是他去码头要找的东西
<9-9,CASTLE>It's what he was going for on the pier.

305
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,590
<9-9,CASTLE>如果我们能追踪他的资产
<9-9,CASTLE>If we can track his money--

306
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,990
<9-10,BECKETT>你从哪里得到这个的
<9-10,BECKETT>Where did you get that?

307
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,560
<9-10,BECKETT>索菲亚
<9-10,BECKETT>Sophia.

308
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,390
<9-11,CASTLE>她昨晚去了我家
<9-11,CASTLE>She came to my place last night.

309
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,010
<9-12,BECKETT>-不是你想得那样  -当然不是
<9-12,BECKETT>- Not like that. - No, of course.

310
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,700
<9-12,BECKETT>她不是说你是"鲁莽  幼稚
<9-12,BECKETT>So then what happened to "Reckless, immature,

311
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,900
<9-12,BECKETT>自我为中心的混蛋"吗
<9-12,BECKETT>self-centered jackass"?

312
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,450
<9-13,CASTLE>她只是在同事面前表一下姿态
<9-13,CASTLE>She was posturing for her colleagues.

313
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,810
<9-14,BECKETT>贝克特  这是一条线索
<9-14,BECKETT>Beckett, it's a lead.

314
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,120
<9-15,CASTLE>她希望我们继续追查此案
<9-15,CASTLE>She wants us on the case.

315
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,740
<10-1,RYAN>你觉得到底发生了什么事
<10-1,RYAN>What do you think this is about, huh?

316
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,220
<10-2,ESPOSITO>感觉像是情报部门的活动
<10-2,ESPOSITO>It smells like an intelligence op.

317
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,380
<10-3,RYAN>中情局  国安局还是国土安全部
<10-3,RYAN>CIA, NSA, DHS?

318
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,200
<10-4,ESPOSITO>就那几个字母排列组合
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Same letters, different alphabet.

319
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,270
<10-4,ESPOSITO>我以前部队里有些兄弟自愿参加情报部门行动
<10-4,ESPOSITO>I had some buddies from the service volunteer for intelligence ops.

320
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,490
<10-5,RYAN>他们喜欢这份工作吗
<10-5,RYAN>Yeah, how'd they like it?

321
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,810
<10-6,ESPOSITO>他们都牺牲了
<10-6,ESPOSITO>They all died.

322
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,310
<10-7,ESPOSITO>你们认识这个人吗
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Hey, guys. Do you recognize this man?

323
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,250
<10-8,MAN>我还真认识他
<10-8,MAN>Matter of fact, I do.

324
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,160
<11-1,MAN>他大概每周会来这公园两三次
<11-1,MAN>Uh, he comes to the park two or three times a week.

325
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,410
<11-1,MAN>找人一起下棋
<11-1,MAN>Looks for games.

326
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,940
<11-2,RYAN>你还知道些什么
<11-2,RYAN>What do you know about him?

327
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,870
<11-3,MAN>他是一个疯狂的棋手
<11-3,MAN>He's a crazy chess player.

328
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,390
<11-3,MAN>经常棋出怪招
<11-3,MAN>Makes some weird moves,

329
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,590
<11-3,MAN>比如牺牲皇后
<11-3,MAN>like sacrificing his queen

330
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,370
<11-3,MAN>只想看看会发生什么
<11-3,MAN>just to see what happens.

331
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,520
<11-3,MAN>但是他总是会赢
<11-3,MAN>He always wins, though.

332
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,370
<11-4,ESPOSITO>你知道他的名字吗
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Do you know his name?

333
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,880
<11-5,MAN>叫斯科特什么的
<11-5,MAN>Scott or something like that.

334
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,810
<11-5,MAN>但是如果你们想多了解一下这个人
<11-5,MAN>But I-if you want to know about this guy,

335
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,130
<11-5,MAN>你们应该去找雅尼聊聊
<11-5,MAN>you should talk to Jani.

336
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,950
<11-5,MAN>雅尼是谁
<11-5,MAN>Jani? Who's Jani?

337
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,190
<11-7,MAN>另一个棋手
<11-7,MAN>Another player.

338
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,900
<11-7,MAN>他跟你们要找的这个人
<11-7,MAN>Him and your guy...

339
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,830
<11-7,MAN>最近经常聚在一起
<11-7,MAN>been spending a lot of time together lately.

340
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,610
<12-1,BECKETT>布莱克利的六个账户总计有两百万
<12-1,BECKETT>So Blakely had over $2 million in six accounts,

341
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,910
<12-1,BECKETT>但都是用假名开户
<12-1,BECKETT>and none of them under his real name.

342
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,170
<12-1,BECKETT>往里面存款的都是非营利性组织  援助协会
<12-1,BECKETT>Deposits were made by nonprofits, aid groups,

343
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,890
<12-1,BECKETT>还有环保组织
<12-1,BECKETT>environmental organizations.

344
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,010
<12-2,CASTLE>如果这些真是他的秘密咨询业务账户
<12-2,CASTLE>So if those were his secret consulting accounts,

345
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,770
<12-2,CASTLE>那么这些交易中极可能有一笔
<12-2,CASTLE>it's possible that one of those payments

346
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,130
<12-2,CASTLE>是支付潘朵拉计划的
<12-2,CASTLE>was for operation Pandora.

347
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,740
<29-17,SOPHIA>没错  这两笔
<29-17,SOPHIA>Exactly. These two.

348
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,970
<12-2,CASTLE>每笔存入五十万
<12-2,CASTLE>Deposits of half a million dollars each.

349
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,330
<12-3,BECKETT>这一笔是三个月前
<12-3,BECKETT>This one was from three months ago,

350
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,160
<12-3,BECKETT>这一笔是一个星期前
<12-3,BECKETT>and this one was from a week ago.

351
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,340
<12-4,CASTLE>是他开始和结束的报酬
<12-4,CASTLE>His start and finish payments.

352
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,750
<12-5,BECKETT>对  均来自海外账户
<12-5,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. Both from offshore accounts.

353
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,990
<12-5,BECKETT>但现在账户已关闭  是条死胡同
<12-5,BECKETT>But they're closed. It's a dead end.

354
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,210
<12-6,ESPOSITO>我们可能找到条有关布莱克利的线索
<12-6,ESPOSITO>We may have a lead on Blakely.

355
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,440
<12-6,ESPOSITO>公园里的人说他最近总和这人在一起
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Guy in the park said he's been spending time with this man--

<12-7,BECKETT>An economics professor?

360
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,500
<12-8,CASTLE>你觉得与这事有关
<12-8,CASTLE>You think it's related?

361
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,380
<12-9,ESPOSITO>我不知道这资料是否有用
<12-9,ESPOSITO>Well, I don't know if this helps,

362
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,860
<12-9,ESPOSITO>但他还是国际货币基金组织
<12-9,ESPOSITO>but the guy is also an advisor to the I.M.F.,

<13-1,YANNI>Yeah, that's him.

366
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,320
<13-1,YANNI>但他说自己叫麦克格雷格  不是布莱克利
<13-1,YANNI>But he said his name was McGregor, not Blakely.

367
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
<13-2,BECKETT>你对他了解多少
<13-2,BECKETT>What do you know about him?

<13-3,YANNI>他是个非常厉害的棋手
<13-3,YANNI>Um, he was a hell of a chess player.

369
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,960
<13-3,YANNI>在我落子之前  他似乎总能洞察
<13-3,YANNI>Uh, it seemed like he knew every move I was gonna make

370
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,760
<13-3,YANNI>我要走的每一步
<13-3,YANNI>before I made it.

371
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,080
<13-4,BECKETT>不  我是说...
<13-4,BECKETT>No, I mean...

372
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,040
<13-4,BECKETT>关于他个人
<13-4,BECKETT>Personally.

373
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,770
<13-5,YANNI>其实他从没聊过他个人的事
<13-5,YANNI>He never really talked about his personal life.

374
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,240
<13-6,RYAN>有目击者称你们常聊天  谈了什么
<13-6,RYAN>Witnesses said you spent a lot of time talking. What about?

375
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,540
<13-7,YANNI>经济学理论

376
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,020
<13-7,YANNI>在知道我的职业之后
<13-7,YANNI>When he found out what I did,

377

<13-8,BECKETT>什么样的问题

381
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,880
<13-9,YANNI>有时觉得他比我知道得还多
<13-9,YANNI>There were times it seemed like he knew more than I did.

382
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,750
<13-9,YANNI>他是个热忱的发烧友
<13-9,YANNI>He was quite the hobbyist.

383
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,850
<13-10,BECKETT>他可不只是个发烧友
<13-10,BECKETT>Oh, he was more than just a hobbyist.

384
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,560
<13-10,BECKETT>他有特别关注过什么东西吗
<13-10,BECKETT>Did he focus on anything in specific?

385
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,040
<13-11,YANNI>我没什么印象
<13-11,YANNI>Uh, not that I remember.

387
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,300
<13-12,RYAN>他从没提过家人或朋友吗
<13-12,RYAN>And he never mentioned any family or friends?

388
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,200
<13-13,YANNI>-没有  -他去哪里买东西
<13-13,YANNI>- No. - Anywhere he might have shopped?

389
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,300
<13-14,RYAN>有任何能看出他住哪的线索吗
<13-14,RYAN>Anything that might indicate where he lived?

390
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,220
<13-15,YANNI>没有  但我觉得他住在联合广场
<13-15,YANNI>No. B- but I think he lived in Union Square.

391
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,520
<13-16,BECKETT>为什么这么说
<13-16,BECKETT>And what makes you say that?

392
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,080
<13-17,YANNI>有次我们散步结束
<13-17,YANNI>After one of our walks,

393
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,140
<13-17,YANNI>我发现把棋盘忘在公园了
<13-17,YANNI>uh, I discovered I'd left my chess set in the park.

394
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,110
<13-17,YANNI>往回走时  我看见他走向那里的一栋楼
<13-17,YANNI>And on my way back, I saw him head into a building there.

395
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,130
<13-18,BECKETT>你能替我们指出是哪幢楼吗
<13-18,BECKETT>Do you think you can identify that building for us?

<13-19,YANNI>我想可以
<13-19,YANNI>I think so.

<14-1,SUPER>对  他就住这里
<14-1,SUPER>Uh, yeah, this is his place right here.

399
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,810
<14-1,SUPER>但他叫芬利  不是布莱克利或是麦克格雷格
<14-1,SUPER>But he said his name was Finley, not Blakely or McGregor.

400
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,310
<14-2,BECKETT>谢了
<14-2,BECKETT>Thanks.

421
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,820
<15-2,CASTLE>但有些比我们聪明的人相信他能做到

<16-10,GAGE>to know something's wrong without knowing why.

469
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,700
<16-10,GAGE>通常是些小事情
<16-10,GAGE>It's always something small--

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,750
<16-10,GAGE>几乎察觉不到的停顿

<16-10,GAGE>Something's wrong,

475
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,280
<16-10,GAGE>如果你不查明是什么事

<16-10,GAGE>你就活不过这周
<16-10,GAGE>you're not gonna survive the week.

<16-10,GAGE>但这两件事他们都休想得逞
<16-10,GAGE>but neither of those things are gonna happen.

481
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,170
<16-10,GAGE>你得把目标的姓名告诉我
<16-10,GAGE>Now I need you to tell me what the name of the target is.

482
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,550
<16-11,CASTLE>让我先给我中情局的联系人打电话
<16-11,CASTLE>Look, let me call my CIA contact.

<16-12,GAGE>by military industrial concerns linked with Eastern Europe.

486
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,270
<16-12,GAGE>他们无法完成这样的行动
<16-12,GAGE>They can't pull off this operation,

487
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,330
<16-12,GAGE>必须有内应帮忙才有可能
<16-12,GAGE>all right, not without help from the inside.

<16-12,GAGE>探长  你还不懂吗
<16-12,GAGE>Detective, don't you get it?

489
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,690
<16-13,GAGE>我的自己人在陷害我
<16-13,GAGE>My own people are setting me up.

490

<16-13,GAGE>我是他们的调虎离山之计
<16-13,GAGE>because I'm the diversion.

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,590
<16-13,GAGE>如果每个人都在阻止我  却没人...
<16-13,GAGE>Okay, if everyone's trying to stop me, then no one--

493
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,340
<16-14,BECKETT>没人去阻止潘朵拉
<16-14,BECKETT>Then no one's trying to stop Pandora.

494
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,990
<16-15,GAGE>除了我
<16-15,GAGE>No one but me.

<17-2,SOPHIA>He needed your trust.

503
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,070
<17-3,BECKETT>但是他为什么问我们"关键"是谁
<17-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but then why did he ask us who the linchpin was?

504
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,720
<17-3,BECKETT>他不是应该已经知道了吗
<17-3,BECKETT>Shouldn't he have known?

505
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,150
<17-4,SOPHIA>他在保护他的行动
<17-4,SOPHIA>He was protecting his op.

506
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,720
<17-4,SOPHIA>想要查明我们知情程度  然后再杀你们
<17-4,SOPHIA>He was ascertaining how much we knew before he killed you.

507
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,670
<17-5,CASTLE>如果你说的对  而袭击只是一出戏
<17-5,CASTLE>Well, if you're right and the attack on us was staged,

508
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,000
<17-5,CASTLE>那他不可能是单独行动
<17-5,CASTLE>then he can't be working alone.

509
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,100
<17-5,CASTLE>盖奇肯定有一个同伙
<17-5,CASTLE>Gage must have a partner.

510
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,410
<17-6,SOPHIA>就是说这事还没完
<17-6,SOPHIA>Which means it's not over.

511
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,540
<17-6,SOPHIA>消防人员没控制住布莱克利公寓的火势
<17-6,SOPHIA>Fire crews were unable to contain the blaze in Blakely's apartment.

512
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,150
<17-7,SOPHIA>他的研究都没了
<17-7,SOPHIA>All of his research is gone.

513
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,330
<17-7,SOPHIA>在所有面部识别数据库里搜索这个
<17-7,SOPHIA>I want you to run this through every facial rec database we have.

514
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,370
<17-7,SOPHIA>我要知道她是谁
<17-7,SOPHIA>I want to know who she is

515
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,010
<17-7,SOPHIA>还有一个十岁的女孩
<17-7,SOPHIA>and I want to know how the hell a 10-year-old girl

516
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,360
<17-7,SOPHIA>怎么会是引发战争的第一块多米诺骨牌
<17-7,SOPHIA>could be the first domino in the march toward war.

517
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,890
<17-8,SOPHIA>盖奇在哪里
<17-8,SOPHIA>Where's Gage?

518
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,970
<17-9,DANBERG>在禁闭室
<17-9,DANBERG>In the tank.

519
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,700
<18-1,SOPHIA>那个被你扔出窗外的人加里·哈勃
<18-1,SOPHIA>You know that guy you threw out the window-- Gary Harper?

520
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,960
<18-1,SOPHIA>他是我朋友
<18-1,SOPHIA>He was a friend.

521
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,990
<18-2,GAGE>那你就不该派他来找我
<18-2,GAGE>Then you shouldn't have sent him for me.

522
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,580
<18-3,SOPHIA>我们以前见过
<18-3,SOPHIA>You know, we've met before.

523
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,510
<18-3,SOPHIA>在柏林
<18-3,SOPHIA>In Berlin,

524
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,320
<18-3,SOPHIA>曼海姆那件事
<18-3,SOPHIA>the Mannheim business.

525
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,710
<18-3,SOPHIA>交货的时候你也跟西班牙人在一起
<18-3,SOPHIA>You were there at the drop-off with the Spaniard.

526
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,900
<18-3,SOPHIA>你很棒
<18-3,SOPHIA>You were good.

527
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,110
<18-3,SOPHIA>你现在在为谁卖命
<18-3,SOPHIA>So who are you working for now?

528
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,980
<18-4,SOPHIA>那个小女孩是谁
<18-4,SOPHIA>Who's the girl?

529
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,540
<18-4,SOPHIA>"关键"是谁
<18-4,SOPHIA>Who's the linchpin?

530
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,830
<18-5,GAGE>谁让我坐了冷板凳
<18-5,GAGE>Who put me in the cold?

531
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,250
<18-5,GAGE>谁陷害了我
<18-5,GAGE>Who set me up?

532
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,930
<18-6,SOPHIA>那么你认为中情局内有内应
<18-6,SOPHIA>So you think there's someone inside the CIA--

533
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,500
<18-6,SOPHIA>有个内鬼  叛徒
<18-6,SOPHIA>a mole, a traitor?

534
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,630
<18-6,SOPHIA>你是这么想得吗
<18-6,SOPHIA>Is that what you think?

535
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,160
<18-7,SOPHIA>我想你或许是对的
<18-7,SOPHIA>You know, I think you could be right.

536
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,540
<18-7,SOPHIA>那个人就是你
<18-7,SOPHIA>And I think it's you.

537
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,960
<18-8,GAGE>你在犯下错误
<18-8,GAGE>You're making a mistake.

538
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,240
<18-9,SOPHIA>不  你和你的同伙在犯错
<18-9,SOPHIA>No, you and your partner are making a mistake.

539
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,070
<18-9,SOPHIA>我没有同伙
<18-9,SOPHIA>I don't have a partner.

540
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,040
<18-10,GAGE>那个杀了麦格拉和布莱克利的人
<18-10,GAGE>The guy out there, the one that killed McGrath and Blakely

541
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,970
<18-10,GAGE>那个把你的朋友撞进河里
<18-10,GAGE>and drove your friends into the water,

542
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,860
<18-10,GAGE>正在执行潘朵拉的那个人
<18-10,GAGE>the one carrying out operation Pandora,

543
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,290
<18-10,GAGE>他和我不是一伙人
<18-10,GAGE>he's not with me.

544
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,240
<18-10,GAGE>我在港口看到他了  看他的身手
<18-10,GAGE>I saw him at the docks, the way he moved.

545
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,260
<18-10,GAGE>他是你们的人
<18-10,GAGE>He's with you.

546
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,300
<18-10,GAGE>他是中情局特工
<18-10,GAGE>He's CIA.

547
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,560
<19-1,BECKETT>你确定他在说谎吗
<19-1,BECKETT>Are you sure he's lying?

548
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,620
<19-1,BECKETT>他没有显露出任何撒谎的身体特征
<19-1,BECKETT>He's not expressing any of the physiological traits.

549
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,480
<19-2,DANBERG>他接受过说谎训练  不会露出马脚
<19-2,DANBERG>He's trained to lie without betraying himself.

550
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,170
<19-2,DANBERG>他想挑拨我们之间的关系  让我们互相怀疑
<19-2,DANBERG>He wants to divide us, make us suspicious of each other.

551
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,310
<19-2,DANBERG>相信我  叛徒绝对是他
<19-2,DANBERG>Trust me. There's no mole but him.

552
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,560
<19-3,CASTLE>万一你判断错了  他说得是事实呢
<19-3,CASTLE>What if you're wrong? What if he's telling the truth?

553
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,380
<19-4,SOPHIA>这无关紧要
<19-4,SOPHIA>That is immaterial.

554
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,790
<19-4,SOPHIA>现在  外面还有人
<19-4,SOPHIA>Right now, there is someone else out there,

555
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,560
<19-4,SOPHIA>正在准备实行潘朵拉
<19-4,SOPHIA>who is preparing to go through with Pandora,

556
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,350
<19-4,SOPHIA>那个小女孩是关键
<19-4,SOPHIA>and that girl is the key.

557
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,870
<19-4,SOPHIA>我们要找到她
<19-4,SOPHIA>We need to find her.

558
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,290
<19-4,SOPHIA>所有的数据库都查不到
<19-4,SOPHIA>Still negative on all databases.

559
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,490
<20-1,SOPHIA>她是外籍人士  可能不在我们的数据库里
<20-1,SOPHIA>She's a foreign national. She might not be in any of ours.

560
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,420
<20-2,CASTLE>她的校服呢
<20-2,CASTLE>What about her school uniform?

561
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,650
<20-2,CASTLE>可以通过那个找到她吗
<20-2,CASTLE>Can you identify her through that?

562
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,760
<20-2,CASTLE>试过了  露出的校徽太少  无法辨认
<20-2,CASTLE>We tried. There's not enough of the crest visible to identify it.

563
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,680
<20-3,BECKETT>你们真的相信吗  谋杀一个小女孩
<20-3,BECKETT>Do you really buy this, that killing a little girl

564
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,550
<20-3,BECKETT>会导致美国的瓦解
<20-3,BECKETT>could lead to the collapse of the United States?

565
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,060
<20-3,BECKETT>太荒谬了
<20-3,BECKETT>I mean, it just seems crazy.

566
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,340
<20-4,SOPHIA>布莱克利的第一个关键理论也很荒谬
<20-4,SOPHIA>Yeah, well, so did Blakely's first linchpin.

567
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,200
<20-4,SOPHIA>他们要求他制定一个非核军事战略
<20-4,SOPHIA>They asked him to develop a nonnuclear military strategy

568
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,010
<20-4,SOPHIA>能够瓦解苏联
<20-4,SOPHIA>that would bring down the Soviet Union.

569
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,220
<20-4,SOPHIA>结果发现  我们只需开支超过他们即可
<20-4,SOPHIA>Turns out, all we had to do was outspend them.

570
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,170
<20-5,SOPHIA>得再审讯一下盖奇
<20-5,SOPHIA>Need to take another run at Gage.

571
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,710
<20-5,SOPHIA>看来他是我们目前唯一线索了
<20-5,SOPHIA>Looks like he's all we've got.

572
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,060
<21-1,SOPHIA>封锁这里
<21-1,SOPHIA>Put us on lockdown.

573
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,050
<21-1,SOPHIA>禁止任何人进出
<21-1,SOPHIA>No one leaves or enters the facility.

574
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,620
<21-1,SOPHIA>接触烧伤  他是被近距离射杀的
<21-1,SOPHIA>Contact burns. He was shot point-blank.

575
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,840
<22-1,BECKETT>怎么会没有人听到枪声
<22-1,BECKETT>How is it that nobody heard the shot?

576
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,490
<22-2,CASTLE>这间房子是隔声的
<22-2,CASTLE>The room is soundproof.

577
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,880
<22-3,SOPHIA>关键问题在于
<22-3,SOPHIA>The real question is...

578
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,530
<22-3,SOPHIA>怎么会没人看到
<22-3,SOPHIA>how come nobody saw?

579
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,320
<22-3,SOPHIA>有人黑了视频流
<22-3,SOPHIA>Someone hacked the video stream.

580
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
<22-3,SOPHIA>怎么可能  你们可是中情局
<22-3,SOPHIA>How is that possible? You're the CIA.

581
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
<23-1,CASTLE>你们的电脑是全世界最安全的
<23-1,CASTLE>You have the most secure computers in the world.

582
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,470
<23-2,SOPHIA>盖奇有可能没说谎
<23-2,SOPHIA>It's possible because Gage was right.

583
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,900
<23-2,SOPHIA>局里有叛徒
<23-2,SOPHIA>There's a mole in the CIA,

584
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,220
<23-2,SOPHIA>那个人就是这个团队中的一员
<23-2,SOPHIA>and he's in this unit.

585
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,170
<23-3,DANBERG>封锁完毕
<23-3,DANBERG>Facility's locked down.

586
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,980
<23-3,DANBERG>所有人员都在岗
<23-3,DANBERG>All personnel have been accounted for.

587
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,560
<23-4,BECKETT>有多少人有权限进入那个房间
<23-4,BECKETT>How many people had access to that room?

588
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,160
<23-5,SOPHIA>18个
<23-5,SOPHIA>18.

589
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,040
<23-5,SOPHIA>长官  我已经隔离了篡改视频的子程序
<23-5,SOPHIA>Ma'am, I've isolated the subroutine used to doctor the video.

590
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,670
<23-6,DANBERG>它嵌在一个蠕虫病毒里才没被发现
<23-6,DANBERG>It was embedded in a software worm to escape detection.

591
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,400
<23-6,DANBERG>就是说查不出它的来源
<23-6,DANBERG>Then there's no way to tell where it came from.

592
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,250
<24-7,BECKETT>我或许可以使用还原算法
<24-7,BECKETT>I may be able to use a reductive logarithm

593
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,470
<24-8,SOPHIA>以分离出它进入系统的路径
<24-8,SOPHIA>to isolate the pathway it took through the system.

594
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,800
<23-6,DANBERG>这样也许就能知道来源了
<23-6,DANBERG>It might tell us where it was loaded.

595
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
<23-7,DANBERG>-你能做到吗  -我试试
<23-7,DANBERG>- You can do that? - I can try.

596
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,030
<23-8,SOPHIA>开始吧
<23-8,SOPHIA>Do it.

597
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,180
<23-9,CASTLE>我完全不懂他们在说什么
<23-9,CASTLE>Wow. I got no idea what they're talking about,

598
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,730
<23-9,CASTLE>可这好令人好激动啊
<23-9,CASTLE>but this is very exciting.

599
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,560
<23-9,CASTLE>好了  开始追踪
<23-9,CASTLE>There it is. Starting the trace.

600
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:37,990
<23-10,SOPHIA>找到了
<23-10,SOPHIA>Got it.

601
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,390
<23-10,SOPHIA>这就是上传病毒的终端地址
<23-10,SOPHIA>That's the terminal address where the virus was uploaded.

602
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,460
<23-10,SOPHIA>是谁的
<23-10,SOPHIA>Whose is it?

603
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:45,880
<23-10,SOPHIA>杜兰特工
<23-10,SOPHIA>Agent Trahn's.

604
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,300
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>什么  不是我
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>What? No.

605
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,930
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>-你们弄错了  -把手放在显眼位置
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>- There's been a mistake. - Get your hands where I can see them.

606
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,040
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>趴在地上  现在  快点  趴下
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>Get down on the ground now! Do it now! Down now!

607
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,140
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>等一下  那是个诱饵
<23-11,AGENT TRAN>Wait! It's a decoy.

608
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,580
<23-12,SOPHIA>黑客盗用了那个IP  不是杜兰
<23-12,SOPHIA>The hacker piggybacked the I.P. it's not Trahn.

609
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,420
<23-12,SOPHIA>那到底是谁
<23-12,SOPHIA>Then who is it?

610
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,430
<23-12,SOPHIA>上传病毒的那人用了杜兰的终端IP
<23-12,SOPHIA>Whoever uploaded it used Trahn's terminal I.P.

611
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,600
<23-13,SOPHIA>隐藏了自己的身份
<23-13,SOPHIA>to hide their I.D.

612
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,940
<23-13,SOPHIA>他很强  但我更胜一筹
<23-13,SOPHIA>They're good, but I'm better.

<23-24,SOPHIA>各就各位  我把电梯降回来
<23-24,SOPHIA>Standby. I'm bringing it back down.

635
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,630
<24-1,CASTLE>这你不可能会发觉
<24-1,CASTLE>There's no way you could've known.

636
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,820
<24-2,SOPHIA>不可能吗  当我们刚得知"潘朵拉"
<24-2,SOPHIA>No? When we first got wind of Pandora,

637
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,220
<24-2,SOPHIA>是丹博格首先找到所有关联
<24-2,SOPHIA>Danberg was the one who found all the connections.

638
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,690
<24-2,SOPHIA>是他追踪到盖奇的
<24-2,SOPHIA>He was the one who traced it to Gage,

639
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,820
<24-2,SOPHIA>只为不让我们过于接近他
<24-2,SOPHIA>all so we wouldn't get too close to him.

640
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,510
<24-2,SOPHIA>他甚至劝我踢走你们二位
<24-2,SOPHIA>He even tried to convince me to get rid of you two.

641
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,600
<24-2,SOPHIA>最糟糕的是
<24-2,SOPHIA>And worst of all,

642
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,980
<24-2,SOPHIA>他可能不是单独行动
<24-2,SOPHIA>he may not be working alone.

643
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,070
<24-3,BECKETT>潘朵拉的影响很大
<24-3,BECKETT>The implications of Pandora are huge.

644
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,070
<24-3,BECKETT>我不懂为什么我们自己人会
<24-3,BECKETT>I don't understand how one of our own would actually

645
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,540
<24-3,BECKETT>希望把我们国家甚至世界搅入战争
<24-3,BECKETT>want to plunge the country or the world into war.

646
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,150
<24-4,SOPHIA>金钱  意识形态  都说不通
<24-4,SOPHIA>Money, ideology-- none of it makes any sense.

647
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,290
<24-5,CASTLE>动机不重要
<24-5,CASTLE>Well, the motives don't matter.

648
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,950
<24-5,CASTLE>重要的是阻止潘朵拉
<24-5,CASTLE>All that matters is stopping Pandora.

649
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,270
<24-5,CASTLE>盖奇说他听到些风声
<24-5,CASTLE>Gage said he picked up chatter.

650
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,100
<24-5,CASTLE>他说行动明天执行
<24-5,CASTLE>He said it's going down tomorrow.

651
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,970
<24-6,SOPHIA>跟我们听到的一致
<24-6,SOPHIA>We've heard the same thing,

652
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,020
<24-6,SOPHIA>就是说我们的时间所剩无几
<24-6,SOPHIA>which means, we don't have any time.

653
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,610
<24-6,SOPHIA>必须要找到小女孩
<24-6,SOPHIA>We have to find her.

654
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,140
<24-7,BECKETT>我们一定遗漏了什么
<24-7,BECKETT>Well, there's gotta be something that we missed,

655
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,660
<24-7,BECKETT>某些能够帮助我们找到她的细节
<24-7,BECKETT>some detail that'll help us figure out who she is.

656
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,540
<24-8,SOPHIA>我们已经在所有数据库里搜索了
<24-8,SOPHIA>We've run it through every database we have.

657
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,280
<24-8,SOPHIA>我们查了能查的一切
<24-8,SOPHIA>We have looked through everything.

658
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,560
<24-8,SOPHIA>不是一切
<24-8,SOPHIA>Not everything.

659
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,530
<24-9,CASTLE>你们监控全球地形  对吧
<24-9,CASTLE>You guys maintain a topographical survey of the earth, right?

660
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,390
<24-10,SOPHIA>是的  怎么
<24-10,SOPHIA>Yeah. Why?

661
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,190
<24-11,CASTLE>不要搜索女孩
<24-11,CASTLE>So don't search for the girl.

662
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,760
<24-11,CASTLE>搜索这些山脉
<24-11,CASTLE>Run the mountains.

663
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,610
<24-11,CASTLE>如果知道她来自哪儿  就可以缩小搜索范围了
<24-11,CASTLE>If we know where she's from, we can narrow down our search.

664
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,760
<24-12,SOPHIA>你真天才
<24-12,SOPHIA>You are a genius.

665
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,820
<25-1,BECKETT>这要花多长时间
<25-1,BECKETT>How long will this take?

666
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,920
<25-2,SOPHIA>地球很大
<25-2,SOPHIA>It's a big world.

667
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,170
<25-2,SOPHIA>我们调出了所有的位于
<25-2,SOPHIA>We've pulled anything arid

668
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,310
<25-2,SOPHIA>维度40度到60度之间的干旱地带
<25-2,SOPHIA>and everything above and below 60 degrees latitude,

669
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,870
<25-2,SOPHIA>但他们估算  可能要32个小时
<25-2,SOPHIA>but they're estimating, it could take 32 hours.

670
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,980
<25-3,CASTLE>会是个漫漫长夜啊
<25-3,CASTLE>Sounds like a long night.

671
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,410
<25-3,CASTLE>我去倒些咖啡
<25-3,CASTLE>I'll get some coffees.

<25-6,SOPHIA>是的  曾经
<25-6,SOPHIA>I did. Once.

675
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,550
<25-7,BECKETT>你们之间发生了什么
<25-7,BECKETT>S-so what happened?

676
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,080
<25-7,BECKETT>如果你不介意的话
<25-7,BECKETT>If you don't mind my asking.

677
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,700
<25-8,SOPHIA>是这样的
<25-8,SOPHIA>Well, um,

678
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,610
<25-8,SOPHIA>你有过
<25-8,SOPHIA>well, you ever...

679
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,570
<25-8,SOPHIA>认识一个人  然后立刻产生了...
<25-8,SOPHIA>meet someone and--and have that...

680
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,420
<25-8,SOPHIA>强烈的吸引力的经历吗
<25-8,SOPHIA>intense attraction right away...

681
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,450
<25-8,SOPHIA>那种张力
<25-8,SOPHIA>You know, that tension?

682
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,040
<25-8,SOPHIA>我们抗拒了几个月  后来
<25-8,SOPHIA>Well, we fought it for months, and then...

683
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,290
<25-8,SOPHIA>后来我们再也不能忍受了
<25-8,SOPHIA>And then we just couldn't stand it anymore.

684
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,630
<25-9,SOPHIA>但之后  感觉
<25-9,SOPHIA>But afterward, it--it was like

685
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,140
<25-9,SOPHIA>那种张力是我们
<25-9,SOPHIA>that tension was all we...

<25-9,SOPHIA>仅有的
<25-9,SOPHIA>had really in.

<25-9,SOPHIA>除此之外  我们之间剩下的只有
<25-9,SOPHIA>And without it, all we were left with was that...

688

<25-9,SOPHIA>把彼此逼疯的那些琐事
<25-9,SOPHIA>Well, those things that drove us crazy about each other.

<25-12,SOPHIA>Sometimes I wish we had never slept together...

693
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,750
<25-12,SOPHIA>应该一直那样暧昧着
<25-12,SOPHIA>Had kept that longing.

<25-14,SOPHIA>Well, we save the world,

696
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,130

727
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,700
<27-3,SOPHIA>但由于他支持中国购买美国国债的原因
<27-3,SOPHIA>But we left him alone because he was supportive

729
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,010
<27-2,BECKETT>现在如果有人除掉祥
<27-2,BECKETT>Now if someone were to take out Xiang,

730
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,900
<27-3,SOPHIA>对大局并无影响
<27-3,SOPHIA>not that much would change.

731
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,540
<27-3,SOPHIA>但如果他的女儿
<27-3,SOPHIA>But if his daughter were killed

732
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,250
<27-3,SOPHIA>在一场拙劣的暗杀中遇害
<27-3,SOPHIA>in a botched assassination attempt,

733
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,100
<27-3,SOPHIA>而中国政府又追查到了美国政府的头上
<27-3,SOPHIA>and the Chinese were able to trace it back to the U.S. Government?

734
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,150
<27-4,CASTLE>进而追查到盖奇
<27-4,CASTLE>The trail that led to Gage.

735
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,600
<27-5,SOPHIA>不难想象祥会利用
<27-5,SOPHIA>It's conceivable that Xiang could use

736
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,870
<27-5,SOPHIA>其相当的影响力
<27-5,SOPHIA>his considerable influence

737
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,350
<27-5,SOPHIA>只手让中国停止购买美国国债
<27-5,SOPHIA>to single handedly end China's purchase of the U.S. debt.

738
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,970
<27-6,BECKETT>我们国家靠赤字开支维系
<27-6,BECKETT>This country runs on deficit spending.

739
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,590
<27-6,BECKETT>如果国家借不到钱
<27-6,BECKETT>If--if we can't borrow money--

740
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,010
<27-7,CASTLE>就不能履行国家义务
<27-7,CASTLE>We couldn't meet our obligations,

741
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,110
<27-7,CASTLE>政府就会倒闭
<27-7,CASTLE>the government would shut down.

742
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,560
<27-8,SOPHIA>会被迫进行财政紧缩
<27-8,SOPHIA>Austerity measures would be imposed.

743
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,440
<27-8,SOPHIA>我们将丧失在全球部署军事的能力
<27-8,SOPHIA>We'd lose our ability to deploy our military around the world.

744
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,940
<27-9,BECKETT>美国力量被削弱
<27-9,BECKETT>And then with the U.S. neutralized,

745
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,120
<27-9,BECKETT>我们的敌人就会
<27-9,BECKETT>our enemies would be able

746
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,210
<27-9,BECKETT>疯狂掠夺获取利益
<27-9,BECKETT>to explore their interests unchecked.

747
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:16,900
<27-9,BECKETT>就是这样
<27-9,BECKETT>That's right.

748
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,750
<27-10,SOPHIA>还会爆发地区冲突
<27-10,SOPHIA>And there would be an explosion of regional conflicts,

749
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,190
<27-10,SOPHIA>其中的任何一个都能引发全球战争
<27-10,SOPHIA>any one of which could send us toward global war.

750
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,790
<27-11,BECKETT>一场我们甚至没能力打赢的战争
<27-11,BECKETT>A war that we might not even be able to win.

751
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,250
<27-12,CASTLE>一块多米诺骨牌被撞倒  整个世界将会翻天覆地
<27-12,CASTLE>One domino knocked down, the entire world changes.

752
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,110
<4-2,CASTLE>我们找到祥了
<4-2,CASTLE>We've located Xiang.

753
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,560
<4-3,SOPHIA>一小时前他和中国代表团
<4-3,SOPHIA>He and a chinese delegation

754
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,420
<4-4,BECKETT>刚刚抵达肯尼迪国际机场
<4-4,BECKETT>just landed at J.F.K. an hour ago.

755
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,250
<4-5,SOPHIA>他来纽约了
<4-5,SOPHIA>He's here?

756
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,260
<4-6,DANBERG>参加麦金利大厦举行的联合国贸易会议
<4-6,DANBERG>For a U.N. Trade Conference at the Mckinley Building.

757
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,230
<4-6,DANBERG>他们在过来的路上
<4-6,DANBERG>They're on their way there now.

758
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,620
<4-6,DANBERG>长官  他女儿跟他在一起
<4-6,DANBERG>And, ma'am, his daughter's with him.

759
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,830
<4-6,DANBERG>如果现在召集
<4-6,DANBERG>If we call it in,

760
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,810
<28-1,BECKETT>我能找到安保小分队待命
<28-1,BECKETT>I can get a protective detail waiting.

761
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,570
<28-2,SOPHIA>你觉得警察能够阻拦
<28-2,SOPHIA>You think your cops are gonna be able to stop

762
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,140
<28-2,SOPHIA>中情局训练有素的特工吗
<28-2,SOPHIA>CIA-trained operatives?

763
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,330
<28-2,SOPHIA>他们会送命的
<28-2,SOPHIA>They'd just end up dead.

764
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,500
<28-2,SOPHIA>另外  如泄露半点风声
<28-2,SOPHIA>Besides, if word of this gets out,

765
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,590
<28-2,SOPHIA>将会引发空前绝后的国际争端
<28-2,SOPHIA>it could spark an international incident of epic proportions.

766
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,580
<28-2,SOPHIA>我们得收拾残局  而不是制造事端
<28-2,SOPHIA>We need to clean up the mess, not make one.

767
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,800
<28-3,CASTLE>就我们吗
<28-3,CASTLE>We and what army?

768
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,090
<28-3,CASTLE>你说过我们不能相信别人
<28-3,CASTLE>You said we couldn't trust the others

769
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,620
<28-3,CASTLE>因为他们可能同丹博格是一伙的
<28-3,CASTLE>because they could be working with Danberg.

770
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,520
<28-4,SOPHIA>此处不是中情局在纽约的唯一驻点
<28-4,SOPHIA>This is not the only CIA Station in New York.

771
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,800
<28-4,SOPHIA>我已经叫另外一队人赶去现场
<28-4,SOPHIA>I've got another field team on its way.

772
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,450
<28-4,SOPHIA>封锁这里  等我消息
<28-4,SOPHIA>You seal it up until you hear from me.

773
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,000
<28-4,SOPHIA>禁止电话进出
<28-4,SOPHIA>No calls going in or out.

774
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,010
<28-4,SOPHIA>我不能冒险
<28-4,SOPHIA>I'm not taking any chances.

775
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,000
<28-4,SOPHIA>遵命  长官
<28-4,SOPHIA>Yes, ma'am.

776
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,380
<29-1,SOPHIA>科里根特工  这是贝克特探长和卡塞尔先生
<29-1,SOPHIA>Agent Corrigan, Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle.

777
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,290
<29-1,SOPHIA>代表团人呢
<29-1,SOPHIA>Where's the delegation?

778
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,390
<29-2,AGENT CORRIGAN>五分钟路程
<29-2,AGENT CORRIGAN>Five minutes away.

779
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,300
<29-3,SOPHIA>我们的人就位了吗
<29-3,SOPHIA>We in position?

780
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,760
<29-4,CORRIGAN>走廊上部署了人  街对面也有人监视
<29-4,CORRIGAN>We have teams in the lobby and spotters across the street.

781
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,930
<29-5,BECKETT>丹博格呢
<29-5,BECKETT>What about Danberg?

782
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,600
<29-6,CORRIGAN>45分钟前他进入大厦时
<29-6,CORRIGAN>A guard I.D.'ed him as having entered the building

783
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,780
<29-6,CORRIGAN>被一名警卫认出
<29-6,CORRIGAN>45 minutes ago.

784
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,800
<29-6,CORRIGAN>已有专人就位  得到授权"见即杀"
<29-6,CORRIGAN>We have crews in place authorized to take him out,

785
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,580
<29-6,CORRIGAN>但还没找到他搭档
<29-6,CORRIGAN>but we still haven't identified his partner.

786
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,600
<29-7,SOPHIA>无论发生何事  确保小女孩的安全
<29-7,SOPHIA>Whatever happens, keep the girl alive.

787
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,550
<29-7,SOPHIA>明白吗
<29-7,SOPHIA>Do you understand me?

788
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,600
<29-8,CORRIGAN>是的  长官
<29-8,CORRIGAN>Yes, ma'am.

789
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,260
<29-9,CASTLE>我们要去哪
<29-9,CASTLE>Where are we going?

790
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,100
<29-10,CORRIGAN>这边
<29-10,CORRIGAN>This way.

791
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,220
<29-11,CASTLE>咱们跑这儿来干吗
<29-11,CASTLE>What are we doing down here?

792
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,960
<29-12,CASTLE>咱们不是应该去大堂吗
<29-12,CASTLE>Shouldn't we be headed for the lobby?

793
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,140
<29-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<29-13,BECKETT>Castle.

794
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,900
<29-14,SOPHIA>抱歉
<29-14,SOPHIA>Sorry.

795
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,100
<29-15,CASTLE>你这是干吗
<29-15,CASTLE>What are you doing?

796
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,250
<29-16,BECKETT>丹博格根本就不是叛徒  对吧
<29-16,BECKETT>Danberg wasn't the mole, was he?

797
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,760
<29-16,BECKETT>你才是
<29-16,BECKETT>You are.

798
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,080
<29-17,SOPHIA>去杀了那个女孩  这两个人交给我
<29-17,SOPHIA>Go kill the girl. I'll take care of these two.

799
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
<29-18,CASTLE>一直都是你吗
<29-18,CASTLE>It was you this whole time?

800
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,070
<29-19,SOPHIA>恐怕是的
<29-19,SOPHIA>I'm afraid so.

801
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,370
<30-1,CASTLE>那你又何必把我们带来这里呢
<30-1,CASTLE>Then why bring us here?

802
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,400
<30-1,CASTLE>何不直接把我们留在那边
<30-1,CASTLE>Why not just leave us at the facility?

803
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,670
<30-2,SOPHIA>因为你从不肯善罢甘休
<30-2,SOPHIA>Because you just don't stop.

804
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,350
<30-2,SOPHIA>你非得了解整件事不可
<30-2,SOPHIA>You need to know the story, the whole story.

805
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,070
<30-2,SOPHIA>如果有些细节对不上  你就穷追不舍
<30-2,SOPHIA>And if something doesn't add up, you just don't let go.

806
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,010
<30-2,SOPHIA>你以为我带你们来干什么
<30-2,SOPHIA>Why do you think I brought you inside?

807
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,390
<30-2,SOPHIA>我是在保护这次行动
<30-2,SOPHIA>I was protecting the op.

808
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,160
<30-3,BECKETT>就像你为了保护行动
<30-3,BECKETT>Like you were trying to protect the operation

809
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,260
<30-3,BECKETT>而杀了布莱克利和麦格拉
<30-3,BECKETT>when you killed Blakely and McGrath?

810
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,820
<30-4,CASTLE>你陷害了盖奇
<30-4,CASTLE>You set up Gage.

811
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,020
<30-5,SOPHIA>"关键"要发挥效力
<30-5,SOPHIA>Well, for the linchpin to work,

812
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,190
<30-5,SOPHIA>必须让中国人怪罪美国政府
<30-5,SOPHIA>the Chinese have to blame the U.S. government.

813
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,040
<30-5,SOPHIA>整个行动必须追踪到中情局头上来
<30-5,SOPHIA>The operation has to trace back to the CIA.

814
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,950
<30-6,CASTLE>你要掩盖自己的踪迹  就把他给杀了
<30-6,CASTLE>And when you needed to cover your tracks, you killed him.

815
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,370
<30-6,CASTLE>所以你需要其他替罪羊
<30-6,CASTLE>So then you needed someone else.

816
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,740
<30-6,CASTLE>你需要丹博格
<30-6,CASTLE>You needed Danberg.

817
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,190
<30-6,CASTLE>索菲亚
<30-6,CASTLE>Sophia...

818
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,970
<30-6,CASTLE>第三次世界大战  为什么
<30-6,CASTLE>World War III, why?

819
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,120
<30-7,SOPHIA>这么说吧  这世界上有些人
<30-7,SOPHIA>Let's just say, there are certain parties

820
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,020
<30-7,SOPHIA>会不惜一切代价来重组这个世界
<30-7,SOPHIA>who will pay anything to reshape the world.

821
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,010
<31-1,CASTLE>我不信
<31-1,CASTLE>I don't buy it.

822
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,580
<31-1,CASTLE>我认识的那个索菲亚决不会为了钱
<31-1,CASTLE>The Sophia I know wouldn't sell out her country,

823
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,240
<31-1,CASTLE>或是其它任何原因当叛国贼
<31-1,CASTLE>not for money, not for anything.

824
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,590
<31-2,SOPHIA>你就错在这里  里奇
<31-2,SOPHIA>Well, that's one thing you got wrong, Rick.

826
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,370
<31-2,SOPHIA>给我跪下
<31-2,SOPHIA>On your knees right now.

827
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,600
<31-2,SOPHIA>你们俩都跪下
<31-2,SOPHIA>Both of you.

828
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,980
<32-1,BECKETT>你不可能从这件事中全身而退
<32-1,BECKETT>You're never gonna get away with this.

829
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,440
<32-2,SOPHIA>我当然可以
<32-2,SOPHIA>Of course I will.

830
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,490
<32-2,SOPHIA>我就告诉他们我们尽了全力  却还是晚了一步
<32-2,SOPHIA>I'll just tell them how we all tried to stop it and couldn't,

831
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,250
<32-2,SOPHIA>而你们俩则在我们执行任务的过程中遇害了
<32-2,SOPHIA>and the two of you were killed in the process,

832
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,870
<32-2,SOPHIA>凶手当然就是丹博格
<32-2,SOPHIA>by Danberg, of course.

833
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,850
<32-2,SOPHIA>别担心  我会把你俩塑造成英雄的
<32-2,SOPHIA>Don't worry. I'll make it sound heroic.

834
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,570
<32-2,SOPHIA>你父亲会为你感到自豪的
<32-2,SOPHIA>Your father will be very proud.

835
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,100
<32-3,CASTLE>我父亲
<32-3,CASTLE>My father?

836
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,000
<32-4,SOPHIA>拜托  你不会以为你当初能来中情局
<32-4,SOPHIA>Well, you don't think you gained special access

837
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,420
<32-4,SOPHIA>是因为你的魅力吧
<32-4,SOPHIA>to the CIA back then because of your charm.

838
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,110
<32-5,SOPHIA>你还真是不知情啊
<32-5,SOPHIA>You really don't know, do you?

839
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,420
<32-5,SOPHIA>看来你永远都不会知道了
<32-5,SOPHIA>I guess you never will.

840
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,590
<32-6,BECKETT>不
<32-6,BECKETT>No!

841
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,640
<32-7,BECKETT>快走
<32-7,BECKETT>Come on.

842
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,650
<32-8,DANBERG>只有咱们三个  时间不多了
<32-8,DANBERG>It's just us, and we're out of time.

843
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,210
<33-1,BECKETT>你没事吧
<33-1,BECKETT>Are you okay?

844
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,520
<33-1,BECKETT>他没事
<33-1,BECKETT>He's fine.

845
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,760
<33-2,DANBERG>他没事  他没事
<33-2,DANBERG>He's good. He's okay.

846
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,070
<33-2,DANBERG>先生  你没事吧  你没事吧
<33-2,DANBERG>Sir, are you all right? You all right?

847
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,790
<33-3,BECKETT>-这边  -没错  也许咱们该出去透透气
<33-3,BECKETT>- This way.  - Yeah, maybe we should go outside.

848
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,920
<34-1,ESPOSITO>你觉得这一切到底是怎么回事
<34-1,ESPOSITO>So what do you think this was all about?

849
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,480
<34-2,RYAN>他们没告诉你吗
<34-2,RYAN>They didn't tell you?

850
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,010
<34-2,RYAN>什么
<34-2,RYAN>What? Th --

851
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,350
<34-2,RYAN>他们告诉你了
<34-2,RYAN>They -- they told you?

852
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,510
<34-2,RYAN>她反咬我一口
<34-2,RYAN>Once she turned me out,

853
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,120
<35-1,DANBERG>我也就很快明白了事情的真相
<35-1,DANBERG>it didn't take long to put the pieces together.

854
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,830
<35-1,DANBERG>但是我当时只能旁观
<35-1,DANBERG>But all I could do was watch

855
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,630
<35-1,DANBERG>等着她下一步行动
<35-1,DANBERG>and wait for her to make her move.

856
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,330
<35-2,CASTLE>很难相信她居然是个叛徒
<35-2,CASTLE>Hard to believe she was a traitor.

857
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,580
<35-2,CASTLE>一切都是装出来的
<35-2,CASTLE>It was all an act.

858
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:21,850
<35-3,DANBERG>兰利认为她有可能是前克格勃潜伏间谍
<35-3,DANBERG>Langley thinks she may have been a former K.G.B. sleeper

859
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,150
<35-3,DANBERG>苏联解散  她也就没了着落
<35-3,DANBERG>set adrift when the Soviet Union broke up.

860
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,960
<35-3,DANBERG>她留在局里是因为她无处可去
<35-3,DANBERG>Stayed with the company because she had nowhere else to go.

861
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,490
<35-4,CASTLE>直到更好的机会出现
<35-4,CASTLE>Till a better offer came along.

862
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,570
<35-5,BECKETT>你们查出来她替谁工作
<35-5,BECKETT>Did you ever find out who she was working for,

863
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,800
<35-5,BECKETT>谁才是潘朵拉的幕后黑手了吗
<35-5,BECKETT>who was behind Pandora?

864
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,110
<35-6,DANBERG>没有  就算我查出来了也不能告诉你
<35-6,DANBERG>No, and even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

865
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,540
<35-7,CASTLE>丹博格探员
<35-7,CASTLE>Agent Danberg...

866
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,500
<35-7,CASTLE>索菲亚跟我说了一些事情
<35-7,CASTLE>Sophia said something,

867
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,660
<35-7,CASTLE>她说我父亲在中情局工作
<35-7,CASTLE>Something about my father being in the CIA.

868
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,830
<35-7,CASTLE>你对此会不会也有所耳闻呢
<35-7,CASTLE>Would you know anything about that?

869
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,620
<35-8,DANBERG>我恐怕不知道
<35-8,DANBERG>I'm afraid I don't.

870
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,860
<35-8,DANBERG>抱歉
<35-8,DANBERG>Sorry.

871
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,260
<35-9,DANBERG>贝克特探长
<35-9,DANBERG>Oh, uh, Detective Beckett.

872
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,470
<35-9,DANBERG>给你
<35-9,DANBERG>Here.

873
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,280
<35-9,DANBERG>我让我的人处理了一下你的车
<35-9,DANBERG>I had our guys, uh, take care of your car.

874
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,860
<35-10,BECKETT>你把我的车从河里捞出来了
<35-10,BECKETT>You pulled my car out of the river?

875
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,120
<35-11,DANBERG>是啊  你会发现车比新的还赞
<35-11,DANBERG>Yep. I think you will find it better than new.

876
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,390
<35-12,BECKETT>谢谢
<35-12,BECKETT>Thank you.

877
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,480
<35-13,DANBERG>这是我们该做的
<35-13,DANBERG>It's the least that we could do.

878
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,340
<35-13,DANBERG>保重
<35-13,DANBERG>Take care.

879
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,460
<35-14,CASTLE>你觉得她说的关于我父亲的事
<35-14,CASTLE>You think she was telling the truth

880
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,400
<35-14,CASTLE>是真话吗
<35-14,CASTLE>about my father?

881
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,630
<35-14,CASTLE>如果是的话倒是可以解释
<35-14,CASTLE>I mean, that would explain

882
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,350
<35-14,CASTLE>他为什么突然间就人间蒸发了
<35-14,CASTLE>why he completely disappeared.

883
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,990
<35-14,CASTLE>我
<35-14,CASTLE>I...

884
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,830
<35-15,BECKETT>我认为索菲亚说了很多谎话
<35-15,BECKETT>I think that Sophia told a lot of lies.

885
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,010
<35-15,BECKETT>你肯定觉得不好受吧
<35-15,BECKETT>Must be tough,

886
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,330
<35-15,BECKETT>发现她是个叛国贼
<35-15,BECKETT>finding out that she's a traitor,

887
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,910
<35-15,BECKETT>尤其是你以她为原型创作了克莱拉·斯瑞克
<35-15,BECKETT>especially after you based Clara Strike on her and all.

888
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,460
<35-15,BECKETT>怎么说呢
<35-15,BECKETT>Hmm. Well...

889
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,470
<35-16,CASTLE>克莱拉最开始是以索菲亚为原型  但
<35-16,CASTLE>Clara started off as Sophia, but...

890
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,470
<35-16,CASTLE>她后来变得更像你
<35-16,CASTLE>she ended up being more like you, you know --

891
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,630
<35-16,CASTLE>聪明  勇猛  善良
<35-16,CASTLE>smart, fierce, kind.

892
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,330
<35-16,CASTLE>这也是我被你吸引的原因
<35-16,CASTLE>I think that's one of the reasons I was drawn to you

893
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,960
<35-16,CASTLE>像缪斯一样吸引
<35-16,CASTLE>as a muse.

894
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,800
<35-16,CASTLE>你觉得布莱克利博士
<35-16,CASTLE>You think Dr. Blakely was right...

895
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,700
<35-16,CASTLE>对关键理论的判断是对的吗
<35-16,CASTLE>about the linchpin?

896
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,630
<35-16,CASTLE>你觉得咱们真的拯救了世界吗
<35-16,CASTLE>Do you think we actually saved the world?

897
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,880
<35-17,BECKETT>我认为我们救了一个小女孩的命
<35-17,BECKETT>I think that we saved a little girl's life,

898
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,310
<35-17,BECKETT>这对我来说就足够了
<35-17,BECKETT>and that's enough for me.
