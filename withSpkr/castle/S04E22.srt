9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,810
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad...

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,930
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>你干什么
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>What are you doing?

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,470
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>你有三十秒时间来整装待发
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>You have 30 seconds to suit up.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,230
<1-3,ALEXIS>我...
<1-3,ALEXIS>I--

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,690
<1-4,CASTLE>游戏开始了
<1-4,CASTLE>The game's afoot.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,080
<1-5,ALEXIS>爸...
<1-5,ALEXIS>Dad--

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,560
<1-6,CASTLE>别出声  让我享受这一刻
<1-6,CASTLE>Wait. Let me savor this.

16
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,690
<1-6,CASTLE>你十岁以后我就没赢过你
<1-6,CASTLE>I haven't gotten the drop on you since you were 10.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,690
<1-6,CASTLE>而现在我嗅到了...
<1-6,CASTLE>Oh, this feels like...

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,410
<1-6,CASTLE>胜利的味道
<1-6,CASTLE>Victory.

19
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,410
<1-7,ALEXIS>爸  我不能跟你玩
<1-7,ALEXIS>Dad, look, I can't, okay?

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,560
<1-7,ALEXIS>我还要做一个重大的决定呢
<1-7,ALEXIS>I have a big decision to make.

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,600
<1-8,CASTLE>你至少已经缩小范围了吧
<1-8,CASTLE>Well, have you at least narrowed it down?

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,880
<1-9,ALEXIS>我列出了所有学校的课程和课外活动
<1-9,ALEXIS>I made a list of all the classes and the extra curriculars.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,990
<1-9,ALEXIS>最好的选择貌似就是
<1-9,ALEXIS>And the best choices seem to be

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,560
<1-9,ALEXIS>牛津和斯坦福了
<1-9,ALEXIS>Oxford and Stanford.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,640
<1-10,CASTLE>哥伦比亚大学  纽约大学和瓦萨尔学院呢
<1-10,CASTLE>What about Columbia, N.Y.U., vassar?

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,690
<1-11,ALEXIS>那些都太近了
<1-11,ALEXIS>They're all too close.

27
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,110
<1-11,ALEXIS>我会一直往家跑的
<1-11,ALEXIS>I'd come home all the time.

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,110
<1-11,ALEXIS>我想挑战自我
<1-11,ALEXIS>I want to challenge myself,

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,780
<1-11,ALEXIS>不然我会沉迷在这种事情里的
<1-11,ALEXIS>and I'd get sucked in to things like this.

30
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,390
<1-12,CASTLE>那以后谁来陪我玩
<1-12,CASTLE>But then who's gonna play with me?

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,180
<1-13,ALEXIS>我觉得我该收起镭射枪
<1-13,ALEXIS>I think it's time to holster the laser guns

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,450
<1-13,ALEXIS>长大成人了
<1-13,ALEXIS>and be adults.

33
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,610
<1-14,VEST COMPUTER VOICE>游戏结束
<1-14,VEST COMPUTER VOICE>Game over.

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,500
<1-14,VEST COMPUTER VOICE>请从出口离开
<1-14,VEST COMPUTER VOICE>Please proceed to exit.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,090
<2-1,MARTHA RODGERS>亲爱的  只是游戏而已
<2-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, darling, it's just a game.

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,980
<2-1,MARTHA RODGERS>才不是
<2-1,MARTHA RODGERS>No, it's not.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,470
<2-2,CASTLE>这是历史悠久的家族传统
<2-2,CASTLE>It's--it's a time-honored family tradition

38
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,380
<2-2,CASTLE>从阿丽克西斯的小手
<2-2,CASTLE>that we've been honoring since Alexis

39
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,940
<2-2,CASTLE>能扣动扳机时就开始了
<2-2,CASTLE>could wrap her little finger around a trigger.

40
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,790
<2-2,CASTLE>从第一次到第一千分胜利
<2-2,CASTLE>First one to 1,000 points wins,

41
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,420
<2-2,CASTLE>差一点点就实现了
<2-2,CASTLE>and we were so close.

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,770
<2-2,CASTLE>我们...
<2-2,CASTLE>We...

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,290
<2-2,CASTLE>镭射枪伴随着她的整个童年
<2-2,CASTLE>Laser tagged our way through her preteen years,

44
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,520
<2-2,CASTLE>突然之间
<2-2,CASTLE>and now suddenly,

45
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,730
<2-2,CASTLE>她就...年纪大了  不玩了
<2-2,CASTLE>she's... too old to play.

46
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,710
<2-3,MARTHA>她长大了
<2-3,MARTHA>She's growing up.

47
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,520
<2-4,CASTLE>她不非得长大嘛  你瞧我
<2-4,CASTLE>Well, she doesn't have to. Look at me.

49
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,970
<2-5,MARTHA>看起来
<2-5,MARTHA>Ah, well, it seems...

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,100
<2-5,MARTHA>贝克特探长可以陪你玩
<2-5,MARTHA>detective Beckett is available for a play date.

51
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,560
<2-6,MARTHA>不是吧
<2-6,MARTHA>Really?

52
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,450
<2-7,CASTLE>我和贝克特最近
<2-7,CASTLE>Beckett and I have not been exactly

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,350
<2-7,CASTLE>相处得不是太好
<2-7,CASTLE>hitting it off lately.

54
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,270
<2-8,MARTHA>那你觉得是为什么
<2-8,MARTHA>And why do you think that is?

55
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,500
<2-9,CASTLE>不好意思  你是想说这是我的错吗
<2-9,CASTLE>Oh, I-I'm sorry. Are you saying it's my fault?

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,110
<2-10,MARTHA>跟糟糕的帮派警探胡闹
<2-10,MARTHA>Cavorting with some awful gang detective,

57
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,600
<2-10,MARTHA>带着空姐去犯罪现场
<2-10,MARTHA>showing up at a crime scene with a stewardess--

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
<2-10,MARTHA>如果你想惩罚贝克特
<2-10,MARTHA>If you want to punish beckett,

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,590
<2-10,MARTHA>至少要让她知道为什么
<2-10,MARTHA>at least let her know why.

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,050
<2-11,CASTLE>我没有在惩罚她
<2-11,CASTLE>I'm not punishing her.

61
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,450
<2-11,CASTLE>我...
<2-11,CASTLE>I'm...

62
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,810
<2-11,CASTLE>我有吗
<2-11,CASTLE>Am I?

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,020
<2-12,MARTHA>亲爱的  你受伤了  我明白
<2-12,MARTHA>Oh, darling, you're hurt. I understand that.

64
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,210
<2-12,MARTHA>但是说实在的  你们两个不能这样下去
<2-12,MARTHA>But quite honestly, the two of you cannot go on like this.

65
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,710
<2-13,CASTLE>妈  我跟你说
<2-13,CASTLE>You know what, mother?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,260
<2-13,CASTLE>你说得对极了
<2-13,CASTLE>You're absolutely right.

67
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,610
<2-14,MARTHA>你要去哪
<2-14,MARTHA>Where are you going?

68
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,720
<2-15,CASTLE>犯罪现场
<2-15,CASTLE>To a crime scene...

69
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,270
<2-15,CASTLE>跟贝克特探长办最后一起案子
<2-15,CASTLE>to work my last case with detective Beckett.

70
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,210
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>你说过你不喜欢咖啡的
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>You said you didn't like coffee.

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,690
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>可我喜欢香草拿铁
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I like vanilla lattes.

72
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,320
<3-3,CASTLE>-大家早  -早
<3-3,CASTLE>- Hey, guys. - Hey.

73
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,280
<3-5,CASTLE>谢谢你打电话给我
<3-5,CASTLE>Thanks for calling.

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,630
<3-6,BECKETT>不客气
<3-6,BECKETT>Sure.

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,450
<3-7,ESPOSITO>死者名叫大卫·洛克,  29岁
<3-7,ESPOSITO>So our victim is David Lock, 29.

76
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,980
<3-7,ESPOSITO>他在楼上的一家外币兑换处做货币交易员
<3-7,ESPOSITO>He's a currency trader in a foreign exchange office upstairs.

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,520
<3-7,ESPOSITO>看起来事发时他正要去工作
<3-7,ESPOSITO>Looks like he was heading into work when it happened.

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,020
<3-7,ESPOSITO>今早七点左右他的老板发现了他的尸体
<3-7,ESPOSITO>His body was found by his boss at around 7:00 this morning.

79
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,130
<3-8,PERLMUTTER>我们无畏的英雄们到来了
<3-8,PERLMUTTER>Our intrepid heroes have arrived.

80
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,100
<3-8,PERLMUTTER>还有卡塞尔
<3-8,PERLMUTTER>And Castle.

81
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,640
<3-9,CASTLE>帕穆特
<3-9,CASTLE>Ah, Perlmutter.

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,950
<3-9,CASTLE>我会珍视与你共度的美好时光
<3-9,CASTLE>I will treasure these special moments we've shared.

83
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,620
<3-10,BECKETT>我猜这个就是洛克先生了吧
<3-10,BECKETT>So I take it that this is Mr. Lock?

84
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,940
<3-11,PERLMUTTER>看来他是被人袭击了
<3-11,PERLMUTTER>It appears he was set upon by an unknown assailant.

85
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,830
<3-11,PERLMUTTER>死亡时间大概是凌晨四点左右
<3-11,PERLMUTTER>Time of death was about 4:00 a.m.

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,620
<3-12,BECKETT>死因呢
<3-12,BECKETT>Cause of death?

87
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,140
<3-13,PERLMUTTER>可能是头部撞到混凝土地面
<3-13,PERLMUTTER>Well, probably blunt force trauma to the head

88
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,820
<3-13,PERLMUTTER>造成的钝器伤
<3-13,PERLMUTTER>where it hit the concrete.

89
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,970
<3-14,BECKETT>值钱的东西都还在吗
<3-14,BECKETT>Wallet and cash?

90
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,130
<3-15,ESPOSITO>都还在  明显不是抢劫
<3-15,ESPOSITO>Still intact, so it definitely wasn't a mugging.

91
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,980
<3-16,CASTLE>凌晨四点的毒打  一定有什么动机
<3-16,CASTLE>A savage beating at 4:00 a.m, there must be some motive.

92
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,900
<3-17,BECKETT>他手上这是咬痕吗
<3-17,BECKETT>Is this a bite mark on his arm?

93
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,860
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>不只是咬痕  看他的皮肤
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>It's not just a bite mark. Look at the skin.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,420
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>都被撕烂了  看到没
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>You see how it's torn?

95
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,690
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>凶手像斗牛犬那样紧咬不放
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>The killer latched on and shook like a pit bull

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,990
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>试图把肉撕扯下来
<3-18,PERLMUTTER>trying to tear off the flesh.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,080
<3-19,BECKETT>谢谢你  我们懂了
<3-19,BECKETT>Thanks. Think we got it.

98
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,150
<3-19,BECKETT>还有什么发现
<3-19,BECKETT>Anything else?

99
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,280
<3-20,ESPOSITO>还有这个
<3-20,ESPOSITO>Just this.

100
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,560
<3-20,ESPOSITO>在被害人手里发现的
<3-20,ESPOSITO>It was, uh, found in our victim's hand.

101
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,050
<3-20,ESPOSITO>也许是挣扎的时候从凶手衣服上扯下来的
<3-20,ESPOSITO>It was probably torn off the killer's shirt during the struggle.

102
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,550
<3-21,CASTLE>这是个蕾丝袖口
<3-21,CASTLE>That's a lace cuff.

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,640
<3-21,CASTLE>手工缝制  珍珠纽扣
<3-21,CASTLE>Hand stitched, pearl buttons--

104
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
<3-21,CASTLE>应该是1870年左右的东西
<3-21,CASTLE>I'd say this was circa 1870.

105
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,410
<3-22,CASTLE>我在这方面做了不少研究
<3-22,CASTLE>I did a lot of research on the era.

106
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,640
<3-22,CASTLE>我之前在写一本关于内战的喜剧
<3-22,CASTLE>I was writing a book, a comedy about the civil war.

107
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,070
<3-22,CASTLE>结果貌似...不太喜感
<3-22,CASTLE>Turns out... Not so funny.

108
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,200
<3-23,PERLMUTTER>是吗
<3-23,PERLMUTTER>You don't say?

109
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,130
<3-24,ESPOSITO>谁会穿着150年前的衣服打死别人
<3-24,ESPOSITO>Who would beat a guy to death wearing a 150-year-old shirt?

110
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,300
<3-25,BECKETT>还有个更大的问题
<3-25,BECKETT>You know, the bigger question is,

111
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,210
<3-25,BECKETT>为什么他会在工作的地方遭到袭击
<3-25,BECKETT>why was he attacked here where he worked?

112
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,880
<3-26,ESPOSITO>你跟他老板谈谈吧
<3-26,ESPOSITO>You might want to ask his boss--

113
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,470
<3-26,ESPOSITO>麦克·马修
<3-26,ESPOSITO>Mike Matthews.

114
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,490
<4-1,MIKE MATTHEWS>真难以置信
<4-1,MIKE MATTHEWS>I can't believe it.

115
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,830
<4-2,BECKETT>我们认为大卫的死亡时间大概是凌晨四点
<4-2,BECKETT>We think that David was killed around 4 a.m.

116
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,960
<4-2,BECKETT>你知道他为什么来这么早吗
<4-2,BECKETT>Do you have any idea why he was here so early?

117
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,390
<4-3,MIKE>大卫负责亚洲市场
<4-3,MIKE>David handled the asian markets,

118
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,220
<4-3,MIKE>所以一般都是四点过来
<4-3,MIKE>So he usually got in by 4:00.

119
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,420
<4-3,MIKE>他是个不错的孩子
<4-3,MIKE>He was a terrific kid.

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,820
<4-3,MIKE>工作努力  讨人喜欢
<4-3,MIKE>You know, he was hard-working, well-liked.

121
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,620
<4-4,BECKETT>所有人都这么觉得吗
<4-4,BECKETT>And was that the consensus?

122
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,830
<4-5,MIKE>什么意思
<4-5,MIKE>What do you mean?

123
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,250
<4-6,BECKETT>我是说  有任何同事和他有矛盾吗
<4-6,BECKETT>I mean, did he have any conflicts with anyone at work?

124
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,260
<4-7,MIKE>事实上  上周发生了件事
<4-7,MIKE>Actually, yeah, there was an incident last week.

125
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,640
<4-7,MIKE>有人划了他的车
<4-7,MIKE>Someone keyed his car.

126
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:29,250
<4-8,BECKETT>谁
<4-8,BECKETT>Who?

127
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,780
<4-9,MIKE>大卫认为是查理·科尔曼
<4-9,MIKE>David thought it was Charlie Coleman,

128
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,100
<4-9,MIKE>另一个货币交易员
<4-9,MIKE>one of my other traders.

129
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,690
<4-9,MIKE>之前他俩都争取一个晋升的机会
<4-9,MIKE>Uh, the two of them were vying for a promotion,

130
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,510
<4-9,MIKE>而我选了大卫
<4-9,MIKE>and I went with David.

131
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,170
<4-9,MIKE>查理很不甘心
<4-9,MIKE>Charlie didn't take it too well.

132
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,210
<4-10,BECKETT>查理一般几点来上班
<4-10,BECKETT>What time does Charlie usually show up for work?

133
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,020
<4-11,MIKE>凌晨四点  和大卫一样
<4-11,MIKE>4 a.m., same time as David.

134
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,630
<4-11,MIKE>查理是...
<4-11,MIKE>Look, Charlie's...

135
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,600
<4-11,MIKE>有点古怪
<4-11,MIKE>kind of an oddball,

136
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,620
<4-11,MIKE>但我觉得他不会做这种事
<4-11,MIKE>but I-I don't see him mixed up in this.

137
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,320
<4-12,BECKETT>不管怎样  我们都得找他谈
<4-12,BECKETT>We're gonna need to talk to him anyway.

138
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,110
<4-12,BECKETT>奇怪了
<4-12,BECKETT>That's strange.

139
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,000
<4-13,MIKE>他的车就在大卫的车的旁边
<4-13,MIKE>His car is right there next to david's.

140
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,220
<4-14,CASTLE>为什么这很奇怪呢
<4-14,CASTLE>Why is that strange?

141
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,440
<4-15,MIKE>因为查理今天早上根本没来上班
<4-15,MIKE>Because Charlie never came into the office this morning.

142
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,210
<4-16,BECKETT>他住在哪儿
<4-16,BECKETT>What's his address?

143
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,400
<5-1,CASTLE>太遗憾了
<5-1,CASTLE>That's a shame.

144
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,670
<5-1,CASTLE>本以为这案子会很有趣呢
<5-1,CASTLE>This case had some real promise.

145
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,470
<5-1,CASTLE>残忍的咬痕  重建时期的服装
<5-1,CASTLE>Savage bite marks, reconstruction-era clothing--

146
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,850
<5-1,CASTLE>本该是个有谜团有内情的案子
<5-1,CASTLE>we had some mystery here, a whiff of intrigue.

147
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,100
<5-1,CASTLE>可现在拷个心怀不满的员工结案了
<5-1,CASTLE>Now we're just slapping cuffs on some disgruntled employee.

148
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,450
<5-2,CASTLE>我就是希望这件案子会比较特别
<5-2,CASTLE>I just wanted this one to be special.

149
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,100
<5-3,BECKETT>很抱歉这案子提不起你的兴趣  卡塞尔
<5-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I'm sorry it's not entertaining enough for you, Castle.

150
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,030
<5-3,BECKETT>查理·科尔曼  纽约警局  开门
<5-3,BECKETT>Charlie Coleman, NYPD. Open up.

151
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,850
<5-4,CHARLIE>别靠近  这里不安全
<5-4,CHARLIE>Stay away! It isn't safe!

152
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,430
<5-5,BECKETT>退后
<5-5,BECKETT>Stand back.

153
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,060
<5-6,CHARLIE>这是为了你们好
<5-6,CHARLIE>It's for your own good!

154
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,800
<5-7,CHARLIE>别进来  你们不能进来
<5-7,CHARLIE>Don't come in! You can't come in here!

155
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,740
<5-8,CASTLE>很抱歉  查理
<5-8,CASTLE>Sorry, Charlie.

156
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,090
<5-9,BECKETT>查理  你没事吧  有人吗
<5-9,BECKETT>Charlie, are you okay? Anyone here?

157
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,230
<5-10,CHARLIE>不不不不  退后
<5-10,CHARLIE>No, no, no, no. Get back!

158
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,210
<5-10,CHARLIE>离我远点
<5-10,CHARLIE>Get away from me!

159
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,730
<5-11,BECKETT>我们只是想问你几个问题
<5-11,BECKETT>Listen, we just gotta ask you a few questions.

160
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,880
<5-12,CHARLIE>你们得离开  现在就离开
<5-12,CHARLIE>You need to leave! You need to leave right now!

161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,870
<5-12,CHARLIE>这里不安全
<5-12,CHARLIE>It's not safe!

162
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,530
<5-13,CASTLE>放松  查理  放松  我们是警察
<5-13,CASTLE>Relax, Charlie. Relax. We're cops.

163
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,140
<5-14,CHARLIE>-你是警察吗  -是的
<5-14,CHARLIE>- You're a cop? - Yeah.

164
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,130
<5-14,CHARLIE>那是你的枪吗
<5-14,CHARLIE>Is that your gun?

165
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,670
<5-15,BECKETT>是的
<5-15,BECKETT>Yeah.

166
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,420
<5-18,CHARLIE>开枪打我  快
<5-18,CHARLIE>You need to shoot me. Do it now!

167
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,790
<5-18,CHARLIE>开枪
<5-18,CHARLIE>Do it!

168
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,090
<5-18,CHARLIE>开枪
<5-18,CHARLIE>Do it!

169
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,800
<6-1,BECKETT>好了  查理  好点了吗
<6-1,BECKETT>Okay, Charlie, you feeling better?

170
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,750
<6-2,CHARLIE>好些了
<6-2,CHARLIE>Uh, yeah.

171
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,150
<6-2,CHARLIE>我得问一下
<6-2,CHARLIE>Just gotta ask you a few questions

172
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,530
<6-3,BECKETT>今早你和大卫之间发生的事情
<6-3,BECKETT>about what happened this morning with you and David.

173
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,410
<6-3,BECKETT>你在停车场看到他了吗
<6-3,BECKETT>Did you see him in the parking structure?

174
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,900
<6-4,CHARLIE>是的  他刚刚进来
<6-4,CHARLIE>Yeah, he'd just pulled in.

175
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,870
<6-4,CHARLIE>我们相互问好
<6-4,CHARLIE>I said hello. He said hello.

176
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,350
<6-4,CHARLIE>其实我们关系不怎么好
<6-4,CHARLIE>The two of us aren't real friendly.

177
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,300
<6-5,CASTLE>我们听说了  然后发生了什么
<6-5,CASTLE>So we've heard. What happened next?

178
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,690
<6-6,CHARLIE>然后他停了下来
<6-6,CHARLIE>And then he stopped...

179
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,820
<6-6,CHARLIE>表情很奇怪地盯着我背后
<6-6,CHARLIE>and he stared right past me with this weird look on his face,

180
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,690
<6-6,CHARLIE>然后说  那是什么东西
<6-6,CHARLIE>and then he said, "What the hell is that?"

181
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,910
<6-7,CASTLE>-那是什么呢  -一开始我没看清
<6-7,CASTLE>- What the hell was it? - I couldn't tell at first,

182
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,390
<6-8,CHARLIE>因为它突然就扑向了我们
<6-8,CHARLIE>'cause suddenly, it was all over us.

183
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,960
<6-9,BECKETT>等等  你也被袭击了吗
<6-9,BECKETT>Wait. You were attacked, too?

184
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,220
<6-10,CHARLIE>是的  但它主要是攻击大卫
<6-10,CHARLIE>Yeah, but it was mostly after David.

185
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,760
<6-10,CHARLIE>它对着他哀嚎
<6-10,CHARLIE>I mean, it was just wailing on him.

186
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,980
<6-10,CHARLIE>我用手肘撞那东西的头  却根本没用
<6-10,CHARLIE>I elbowed it in the head, and it didn't even slow down.

187
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,030
<6-11,CASTLE>你说"那东西"是什么意思
<6-11,CASTLE>Okay, what do you mean by "it"?

188
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,290
<6-12,CHARLIE>我打911报警  他们不信我
<6-12,CHARLIE>I called 9-1-1. I told them. They didn't believe me.

189
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,640
<6-12,CHARLIE>没人相信我
<6-12,CHARLIE>No one believes me.

190
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,120
<6-13,BECKETT>告诉我们你看到了什么
<6-13,BECKETT>Just tell us what you saw.

191
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,920
<6-14,CHARLIE>你得保证你相信我
<6-14,CHARLIE>As long as you promise you'll believe me.

192
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
<6-15,BECKETT>好的  我答应
<6-15,BECKETT>Yeah, fine. I promise.

193
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,000
<6-15,BECKETT>答应我
<6-15,BECKETT>promise...

194
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,020
<6-16,CHARLIE>我一开始转化
<6-16,CHARLIE>that you will use your gun on me

195
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,720
<6-16,CHARLIE>就用你的枪杀了我
<6-16,CHARLIE>when I start to turn.

196
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,540
<6-17,BECKETT>-转化  -是的
<6-17,BECKETT>- Turn? - Yeah.

197
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,500
<6-19,BECKETT>转化是什么意思
<6-19,BECKETT>What do you mean, turn?

198
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,060
<6-20,CHARLIE>那个咬了我
<6-20,CHARLIE>The thing that bit me...

199
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,230
<6-20,CHARLIE>杀了大卫的东西
<6-20,CHARLIE>That killed David...

200
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,640
<7-1,CHARLIE>是僵尸
<7-1,CHARLIE>it was a zombie.

201
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,830
<7-1,CHARLIE>僵尸
<7-1,CHARLIE>A z-zombie?

202
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,700
<7-1,CHARLIE>是僵尸  是他妈僵尸
<7-1,CHARLIE>It was a zombie. A freakin' zombie!

203
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,580
<7-1,CHARLIE>先生  能再说一遍吗
<7-1,CHARLIE>Sir, can you repeat that?

204
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,780
<7-2,CHARLIE>僵尸  活死人  天啊  眼睛了无生气
<7-2,CHARLIE>A zombie. The undead. Oh, man...with those dead eyes

205
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,170
<7-2,CHARLIE>肿胀腐烂的皮肤从脸上脱落
<7-2,CHARLIE>and flaps of rotting skin coming off its face.

206
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,230
<7-2,CHARLIE>先生  这条线路仅用于紧急情况
<7-2,CHARLIE>Uh, sir, this line is for emergencies only.

207
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,830
<7-3,CHARLIE>你有什么紧急情况吗
<7-3,CHARLIE>Are you having an emergency?

208
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,130
<7-3,CHARLIE>有  重大紧急情况
<7-3,CHARLIE>Yes! I am having a major emergency here.

209
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,970
<7-3,CHARLIE>你不明白吗
<7-3,CHARLIE>Don't you get it?

210
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,470
<7-3,CHARLIE>这东西刚刚杀了一个人  还咬了我
<7-3,CHARLIE>This thing just killed someone, and it bit me!

211
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,130
<7-3,CHARLIE>我会变成僵尸的  下一个就是我
<7-3,CHARLIE>I'm gonna turn! I'm next.

212
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,950
<7-4,CASTLE>这通报警电话是查理在受到袭击后打的
<7-4,CASTLE>Now Charlie made this 9-1-1 call moments after the attack.

213
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,520
<7-4,CASTLE>你觉得听起来像是假装的吗
<7-4,CASTLE>Does it sound like he's faking to you?

214
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,230
<7-5,BECKETT>听起来像是他精神崩溃了
<7-5,BECKETT>It sounds like Charlie's having a psychotic break.

215
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,850
<7-5,BECKETT>或许是内疚让他崩溃
<7-5,BECKETT>What if his guilt made him snap

216
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,920
<7-5,BECKETT>于是捏造了
<7-5,BECKETT>and he created a fantasy

217
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,470
<7-5,BECKETT>僵尸杀死大卫的幻想呢
<7-5,BECKETT>in which zombies killed David and not him?

218
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,540
<7-6,CASTLE>我不这么想
<7-6,CASTLE>I'm not so sure.

219
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,450
<7-6,CASTLE>他的声音听起来确实像是
<7-6,CASTLE>I mean, his voice does have that authentic ring of

220
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,980
<7-6,CASTLE>吓得要尿裤子了
<7-6,CASTLE>pants-wetting terror.

221
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,950
<7-7,BECKETT>你不是信了查理的故事吧
<7-7,BECKETT>You do not believe in Charlie's story.

222
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,970
<7-8,CASTLE>我相信他相信他的故事
<7-8,CASTLE>I believe he believes it.

223
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,310
<7-9,BECKETT>好吧  不管你相信什么
<7-9,BECKETT>Okay, well, whatever you believe,

224
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,650
<7-9,BECKETT>所有的证据都说明
<7-9,BECKETT>all of the evidence points to the fact

225
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,210
<7-9,BECKETT>查理·科尔曼是凶手
<7-9,BECKETT>that Charlie Coleman is our killer.

226
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,120
<7-10,ESPOSITO>也许不是所有的证据
<7-10,ESPOSITO>Maybe not all the evidence.

227
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,410
<7-10,ESPOSITO>鉴证组分析了查理手臂上的咬痕
<7-10,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. analyzed that bite mark on Charlie's arm.

228
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,850
<7-10,ESPOSITO>结果和死者身上的咬痕匹配
<7-10,ESPOSITO>Turns out that it matches the bite mark on our victim.

229
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,010
<7-11,BECKETT>也许查理咬了大卫之后又咬了自己
<7-11,BECKETT>Maybe Charlie bit David and then he bit himself?

230
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,860
<7-12,ESPOSITO>我也这么想  但是鉴证组还说
<7-12,ESPOSITO>I was thinking the same thing, but C.S.U. also says

231
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,680
<7-12,ESPOSITO>咬痕和查理的牙齿不匹配
<7-12,ESPOSITO>that the bite marks weren't made by Charlie's teeth.

232
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,830
<7-13,CASTLE>等等
<7-13,CASTLE>Oh, wait, um...

233
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,100
<7-13,CASTLE>不好意思
<7-13,CASTLE>Sorry.

234
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,220
<7-13,CASTLE>让我确定我听明白了
<7-13,CASTLE>Let me make sure I understand

235
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,180
<7-13,CASTLE>才能好好地享受这一刻
<7-13,CASTLE>so that I might properly relish this moment.

236
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,480
<7-13,CASTLE>你是说
<7-13,CASTLE>You're saying...

237
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,950
<7-13,CASTLE>证据显示查理和死者
<7-13,CASTLE>The evidence shows that Charlie and the victim

238
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,900
<7-13,CASTLE>都被不知是何方神圣的"第三人"咬了
<7-13,CASTLE>both were bitten by an as-yet unknown third party.

239
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,740
<7-14,ESPOSITO>-我就是这么说的  -也许这人是
<7-14,ESPOSITO>- That's what I just said. - Perhaps even

240
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,790
<7-15,CASTLE>不能思考的
<7-15,CASTLE>a mindless...

241
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,030
<7-15,CASTLE>脚步蹒跚的
<7-15,CASTLE>shuffling...

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,060
<7-15,CASTLE>活死人呢
<7-15,CASTLE>undead third party.

243
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,530
<7-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别说了
<7-16,BECKETT>Castle, just stop.

244
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,550
<7-16,BECKETT>世界上没有僵尸
<7-16,BECKETT>There's no such thing as a zombie.

245
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,700
<7-16,BECKETT>伙计们
<7-16,BECKETT>Guys...

246
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,400
<7-17,KEVIN RYAN>来看看这个
<7-17,KEVIN RYAN>Uh, you gotta see this.

247
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,420
<8-1,RYAN>我在逐一查看停车场附近的
<8-1,RYAN>So I was combing through security camera footage

248
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,740
<8-1,RYAN>监控录像  然后发现了这个
<8-1,RYAN>near the parking garage, and I found this.

249
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,410
<8-2,ESPOSITO>时间显示是凌晨四点过六分
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Time stamp's 4:06 a.m.,

250
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,670
<8-2,ESPOSITO>和死亡时间吻合
<8-2,ESPOSITO>which fits time of death.

251
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,640
<8-2,ESPOSITO>这是凶手
<8-2,ESPOSITO>That's our guy.

252
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,100
<8-3,CASTLE>是的  但这不是查理
<8-3,CASTLE>Yeah, but that's not Charlie.

253
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,380
<8-4,BECKETT>等等  他穿的是什么
<8-4,BECKETT>Wait. What is he wearing?

254
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,060
<8-4,BECKETT>看起来像是老式服装
<8-4,BECKETT>That looks like an old-fashioned suit.

255
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,170
<8-5,CASTLE>款式是1870年间而且...
<8-5,CASTLE>Circa 1870 and...

256
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,860
<8-5,CASTLE>他的衣服少了只袖子
<8-5,CASTLE>his shirt's missing a cuff.

257
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,520
<8-6,BECKETT>他差点被车撞了  却躲都没躲
<8-6,BECKETT>He almost got hit by that taxi. He didn't even flinch.

258
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,810
<8-7,RYAN>估计原因在这里
<8-7,RYAN>Well, maybe this is why.

259
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,240
<8-7,RYAN>瞧瞧另一个角度拍下的画面
<8-7,RYAN>Look what we get from the other angle.

260
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,940
<8-8,CASTLE>伙计们
<8-8,CASTLE>My friends...

261
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,260
<8-8,CASTLE>这玩意儿
<8-8,CASTLE>that...

262
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,540
<8-8,CASTLE>是个僵尸
<8-8,CASTLE>is a zombie.

263
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,140
<8-9,CASTLE>凶手是僵尸
<8-9,CASTLE>Our killer's a zombie.

273
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,230
<9-1,MARTHA>你还挺开心的嘛  考虑到你放话说
<9-1,MARTHA>Well, you're rather upbeat considering you said

274
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,240
<9-1,MARTHA>这是你跟贝克特的最后一起案子
<9-1,MARTHA>this was your last case with Beckett.

275
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,500
<9-2,CASTLE>那是因为我要华丽地离开
<9-2,CASTLE>That's because I am going out with a bang.

276
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,510
<9-2,CASTLE>可以用一个词形容  老妈
<9-2,CASTLE>I have one word for you, mother...

277
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,830
<9-2,CASTLE>僵尸
<9-2,CASTLE>Zombie.

278
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,870
<9-3,MARTHA>因为我妆化多了吗
<9-3,MARTHA>Too much makeup?

279
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,140
<9-4,CASTLE>你看起来很好  我是说被害人
<9-4,CASTLE>You look lovely. I'm referring to our victim

280
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,230
<9-4,CASTLE>是被一具行尸走肉杀害的
<9-4,CASTLE>being killed by one of the walking undead.

281
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,550
<9-4,CASTLE>说真的  就是僵尸
<9-4,CASTLE>And I mean that literally-- a zombie.

282
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,180
<9-4,CASTLE>监控录像把他那副腐烂的样子都拍下来了
<9-4,CASTLE>Security camera caught him in all his putrefying glory.

283
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,380
<9-5,MARTHA>你该不会下载了这段录像吧
<9-5,MARTHA>I don't suppose you downloaded this video by chance?

284
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,650
<9-6,CASTLE>当然没有  那是警方证物
<9-6,CASTLE>Absolutely not. That video's police property.

285
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,090
<9-6,CASTLE>我要是截了屏
<9-6,CASTLE>It would be very, very wrong of me to...

286
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,650
<9-6,CASTLE>还发到我邮箱里  就大大的不对了
<9-6,CASTLE>get a screen grab of it and e-mail it to myself.

287
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,520
<9-7,MARTHA>那就让它成为我们之间的小秘密吧  亲爱的
<9-7,MARTHA>Ooh. Well, it'll be our little secret, darling.

288
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,870
<9-8,CASTLE>老妈  你怎么会对这个案子这么好奇
<9-8,CASTLE>I'm actually surprised at your interest in this case, mother.

289
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,320
<9-9,MARTHA>我能看出
<9-9,MARTHA>Well, I really do know the difference

290
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,330
<9-9,MARTHA>一流的妆容和真正的腐肉之间的区别
<9-9,MARTHA>between a first-rate makeup job and actual decay.

291
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,390
<9-9,MARTHA>你要是想看真正的僵尸
<9-9,MARTHA>You want to see some real zombies,

292
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,690
<9-9,MARTHA>去看托尼奖红地毯上那些个人就好了
<9-9,MARTHA>check out the red carpet at the Tony Awards.

293
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,150
<9-10,CASTLE>我不是...
<9-10,CASTLE>I thought I...

294
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,970
<9-10,CASTLE>我不是把这个放起来了吗
<9-10,CASTLE>I thought I put this away.

295
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,950
<9-11,CASTLE>她在哪
<9-11,CASTLE>Where is she?

296
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,650
<9-11,CASTLE>她在哪
<9-11,CASTLE>Where is she?

297
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,950
<9-12,ALEXIS>被我昨天的演技蒙蔽了吧
<9-12,ALEXIS>You were a fool to buy my act yesterday.

298
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,750
<9-12,ALEXIS>这会儿你正中我的陷阱
<9-12,ALEXIS>And now you've fallen right into my trap.

299
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,080
<9-13,CASTLE>你会为你的背叛付出惨痛代价的
<9-13,CASTLE>You will pay dearly for your treachery.

300
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,350
<9-13,CASTLE>还有你  老妈  居然把我引到这来
<9-13,CASTLE>Et tu, mother, for luring me here.

301
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,700
<9-14,MARTHA>怎么了  我听不懂你的意思
<9-14,MARTHA>Why, whatever do you mean?

302
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,960
<9-15,CASTLE>不亏是我的宝贝女儿
<9-15,CASTLE>That's my girl.

303
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,090
<9-16,ALEXIS>那个僵尸是怎么回事
<9-16,ALEXIS>So what's this about a zombie?

304
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,370
<10-1,CHARLIE>我的苍天呐
<10-1,CHARLIE>Oh, my god.

305
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,320
<10-1,CHARLIE>早告诉你们了  就是他
<10-1,CHARLIE>I told you people. That's him.

306
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,930
<10-1,CHARLIE>好脏好邪恶
<10-1,CHARLIE>Oh, so vile and disgusting--

307
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,670
<10-1,CHARLIE>这就是我看到的僵尸
<10-1,CHARLIE>That's the zombie that I saw.

308
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,710
<10-2,RYAN>我们并不能肯定他是个
<10-2,RYAN>Well, we're not exactly sure that he's a--

309
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,670
<10-3,CHARLIE>什么叫你们不确定
<10-3,CHARLIE>What do you mean, you're not sure?

310
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,040
<10-3,CHARLIE>不然他还能是什么东西
<10-3,CHARLIE>What else could he be?

311
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,820
<10-4,RYAN>重点在于  你的嫌疑被洗清了
<10-4,RYAN>The point is, this puts you in the clear.

312
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,070
<10-4,RYAN>你可以走了
<10-4,RYAN>We're releasing you.

313
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,890
<10-5,CHARLIE>这可不是什么好主意
<10-5,CHARLIE>I'm not sure that's a good idea.

314
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,470
<10-6,RYAN>查理  你如果要转化
<10-6,RYAN>Charlie, if you were going to turn,

315
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,760
<10-6,RYAN>这会儿肯定已经转了
<10-6,RYAN>you would have done it by now.

316
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,380
<10-7,CHARLIE>这玩意儿  你们抓到了吗
<10-7,CHARLIE>This thing, have you caught it?

317
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,170
<10-8,RYAN>还没  放心  我们会抓住他的
<10-8,RYAN>Not yet. Rest assured, we will.

318
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,290
<10-9,CHARLIE>我要待在这儿
<10-9,CHARLIE>I'll just stay here.

319
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,880
<11-1,BECKETT>他不肯走
<11-1,BECKETT>He won't leave?

320
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,490
<11-2,RYAN>查理对这个僵尸的事情深信不疑
<11-2,RYAN>Charlie's pretty convinced about this whole zombie thing.

321
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,480
<11-3,BECKETT>这也太荒谬了吧
<11-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but that's just-- that's ridiculous.

322
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,420
<11-3,BECKETT>是吗
<11-3,BECKETT>Or is it?

323
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,680
<11-4,CASTLE>到目前  查理都说对了
<11-4,CASTLE>Charlie has not been wrong yet.

324
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,480
<11-4,CASTLE>或许凶手就是第一感染源
<11-4,CASTLE>Maybe our killer is Patient Zero,

326
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,200
<11-4,CASTLE>现在正在纽约大街上到处咬人
<11-4,CASTLE>out there right now on the streets of New York,

327
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,760
<11-4,CASTLE>建立一支活死人大军呢
<11-4,CASTLE>building an army of the undead.

328
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,640
<11-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们要找的不是僵尸
<11-5,BECKETT>Castle, what we are looking for is not a zombie,

329
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,030
<11-5,BECKETT>而是一个狡猾的罪犯  他杀了大卫·洛克
<11-5,BECKETT>but a very smart criminal who murdered David Lock

330
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,260
<11-5,BECKETT>还把唯一的目击证人变得疯疯癫癫
<11-5,BECKETT>and is now making our only witness look crazy,

331
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,870
<11-5,BECKETT>他为了隐藏身份
<11-5,BECKETT>and he also dressed up

332
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,070
<11-5,BECKETT>给自己化了妆  穿上戏服
<11-5,BECKETT>in makeup and a costume to hide his identity.

333
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,950
<11-6,CASTLE>除非这不是化妆  也不是戏服
<11-6,CASTLE>Unless that's not a costume or makeup.

334
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,550
<11-7,RYAN>他看起来确实像是真僵尸
<11-7,RYAN>I mean, he does look like a real zombie.

335
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,850
<11-8,ESPOSITO>真僵尸
<11-8,ESPOSITO>A real zombie?

336
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
<11-8,ESPOSITO>真替你臊得慌  兄弟
<11-8,ESPOSITO>I'm embarrassed for you, bro.

337
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,930
<11-9,BECKETT>好吧  那你来解释
<11-9,BECKETT>Okay, then explain this--

338
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,140
<11-9,BECKETT>一个僵尸怎么会
<11-9,BECKETT>why would a zombie go after

339
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,030
<11-9,BECKETT>凌晨四点在停车场里攻击一名外币交易员
<11-9,BECKETT>a currency trader at 4:00 a.m. in a garage?

340
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,940
<11-10,CASTLE>这个简单
<11-10,CASTLE>This one's easy.

341
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,370
<11-10,CASTLE>人的智商越高
<11-10,CASTLE>The more intelligent the victim,

342
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,120
<11-10,CASTLE>其大脑就越美味
<11-10,CASTLE>the more delicious the brains.

343
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,180
<11-11,BECKETT>回到现实世界
<11-11,BECKETT>So returning to the land of facts,

344
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,550
<11-11,BECKETT>-彻查犯罪现场有什么结果吗  -没有
<11-11,BECKETT>- what did you find at the crime scene canvass? - Nada.

345
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,940
<11-12,ESPOSITO>一个人装成僵尸在街上走  居然没人发现
<11-12,ESPOSITO>Only in New York could some guy dress like a friggin' zombie

346
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,310
<11-12,ESPOSITO>只有纽约才会发生这种事
<11-12,ESPOSITO>and walk down the street unnoticed.

347
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,960
<11-13,RYAN>我倒是发现案发前死者行踪有一段空白
<11-13,RYAN>Oh, I did find a gap in our timeline before the murder.

348
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,610
<11-14,BECKETT>什么意思
<11-14,BECKETT>What do you mean?

349
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,950
<11-15,RYAN>根据门卫的口供
<11-15,RYAN>Well, according to the doorman, the victim

350
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,020
<11-15,RYAN>死者于凌晨两点离开公寓  再没回去过
<11-15,RYAN>left his apartment at 2:00 a.m. and he never came back.

351
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,660
<11-16,BECKETT>他于凌晨四点被害  这中间的两小时他在干嘛
<11-16,BECKETT>He was killed at 4:00 a.m.. What was he doing for 2 hours?

352
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,110
<11-17,RYAN>不知道  不过他开车去的
<11-17,RYAN>I don't know, but he drove there.

353
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,020
<11-17,RYAN>信用卡消费记录显示2点44分
<11-17,RYAN>His credit card showed that

354
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,660
<11-17,RYAN>他在休斯顿加过油
<11-17,RYAN>he gassed up on Houston at 2:44 a.m.

355
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,950
<11-18,BECKETT>我们去查他去了哪里
<11-18,BECKETT>All right. Let's figure out where he went.

356
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,640
<11-18,BECKETT>凶手可能是跟踪他到停车场的
<11-18,BECKETT>Trouble might have followed him to the garage.

357
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,330
<11-19,CASTLE>或许是个僵尸
<11-19,CASTLE>Or a zombie did.

358
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,340
<11-20,ESPOSITO>我来告诉你们他去了哪
<11-20,ESPOSITO>I'll tell you where he went.

359
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,570
<11-20,ESPOSITO>找炮友去了
<11-20,ESPOSITO>Booty call.

360
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,480
<11-20,ESPOSITO>技术部的同事在大卫的手机上找到一条短信
<11-20,ESPOSITO>Tech guys pulled a text message off David's phone.

361
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,380
<11-20,ESPOSITO>是他在被害当晚发给一个
<11-20,ESPOSITO>He sent it to a chica the night he died

362
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,720
<11-20,ESPOSITO>姑娘的求爱短信
<11-20,ESPOSITO>wanting to hook up with her.

363
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,750
<11-21,BECKETT>能查到对方名字吗
<11-21,BECKETT>Does she have a name?

364
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,120
<11-22,ESPOSITO>格蕾塔·马斯特亚尼
<11-22,ESPOSITO>Greta Mastroianni.

365
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,380
<12-1,GRETA MASTROIANNI>我不明白
<12-1,GRETA MASTROIANNI>Look, I-- I don't understand.

366
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,970
<12-1,GRETA MASTROIANNI>谁会对大卫下这样的杀手
<12-1,GRETA MASTROIANNI>Who would do something like this to David?

367
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,000
<12-2,RYAN>那晚你有没有见过他
<12-2,RYAN>Did you see him that night?

368
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,110
<12-2,RYAN>我们知道他给你发短信想跟你见面
<12-2,RYAN>We know that he texted you wanting to come over.

369
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,250
<12-3,GRETA>我们没见面  我打电话叫他别来了
<12-3,GRETA>No, I-I called him and told him not to.

370
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,090
<12-4,GRETA>一周前我跟大卫分手了
<12-4,GRETA>I split up with David about a week ago.

371
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,800
<12-4,GRETA>可他还不肯死心
<12-4,GRETA>Um, he was still trying to hold on.

372
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,310
<12-5,RYAN>你们为什么分手
<12-5,RYAN>Why'd you two split up?

373
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,920
<12-6,GRETA>我订婚了  呃...
<12-6,GRETA>I'm engaged, um...

374
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,300
<12-6,GRETA>跟汤姆  汤姆·威廉姆斯
<12-6,GRETA>To Tom-- Tom Williams.

375
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,540
<12-6,GRETA>我们在一起五年了
<12-6,GRETA>We've been together five years.

376
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,200
<12-7,ESPOSITO>那你跟大卫是怎么回事
<12-7,ESPOSITO>How did David figure in?

377
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,580
<12-8,GRETA>我21岁那年在洛杉矶
<12-8,GRETA>I met him when I was 21,

378
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,550
<12-8,GRETA>探亲的时候认识了他
<12-8,GRETA>visiting a cousin in L.A.

379
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,690
<12-8,GRETA>我们度过了几周很愉快的日子
<12-8,GRETA>We had an intense couple of weeks, you know,

380
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,950
<12-8,GRETA>然后三个月前  我在咖啡店又碰到了他
<12-8,GRETA>then three months ago, I ran into him at a coffee shop.

381
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,260
<12-9,RYAN>你未婚夫知道你和大卫的事吗
<12-9,RYAN>And did your fiance know about this affair with David?

382
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,130
<12-10,GRETA>知道  他上周看到了我电脑里的邮件
<12-10,GRETA>Yeah, he found, uh, e-mails on my computer last week.

383
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,650
<12-11,ESPOSITO>他有什么反应
<12-11,ESPOSITO>And how did he react to that?

384
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,780
<12-12,GRETA>很受伤  威胁说要离开我
<12-12,GRETA>He was hurt, he threatened to leave me,

385
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,800
<12-12,GRETA>那时我才意识到我不能没有他
<12-12,GRETA>and that's when I realized what I was about to lose,

386
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,100
<12-12,GRETA>因此跟大卫分了手
<12-12,GRETA>so I broke it off with David

387
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,920
<12-12,GRETA>乞求汤姆再给我一次机会
<12-12,GRETA>and begged Tom to give me another chance.

388
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,700
<12-12,GRETA>他原谅了我
<12-12,GRETA>And he did.

389
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,110
<12-13,ESPOSITO>汤姆昨晚在哪
<12-13,ESPOSITO>So where was Tom that night?

390
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,530
<12-14,GRETA>在家  我们十一点左右睡的
<12-14,GRETA>Home. We went to bed around 11:00.

391
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,010
<12-15,RYAN>他整晚都在吗
<12-15,RYAN>And he was there all night?

392
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,550
<12-16,RYAN>格蕾塔...凌晨四点时汤姆在哪
<12-16,RYAN>Greta... Where was Tom at 4:00 a.m.?

393
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,600
<12-16,RYAN>我不知道
<12-16,RYAN>Look, I don't know, okay?

394
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,900
<12-17,GRETA>我两点半的时候醒过来  他不在身旁
<12-17,GRETA>I woke up around 2:30, and he wasn't there.

395
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,600
<12-17,GRETA>我以为他在客厅里看电视
<12-17,GRETA>I figured he was watching TV in the living room,

396
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,630
<12-17,GRETA>但我早上起床的时候  发现...
<12-17,GRETA>but when I got up in the morning--

397
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,680
<12-18,RYAN>他不在公寓里  那他一整晚去哪了
<12-18,RYAN>He wasn't in the apartment. So where was he all night?

398
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,140
<12-19,GRETA>我知道你想说什么
<12-19,GRETA>I see what you're getting at with this, okay?

399
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,630
<12-19,GRETA>但是这事跟汤姆没关系
<12-19,GRETA>But Tom had nothing to do with it.

400
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,660
<12-20,RYAN>大卫是用公司的邮件给你发的电邮吗
<12-20,RYAN>Did David e-mail you from his office account?

401
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,680
<12-20,RYAN>是
<12-20,RYAN>Yeah.

402
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,630
<12-21,GRETA>怎么了
<12-21,GRETA>Why?

403
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,810
<12-22,ESPOSITO>这样一来你未婚夫就知道大卫在哪工作
<12-22,ESPOSITO>Because that means that your fiance knew where David worked.

404
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,120
<13-1,TOM WILLIAMS>那家伙死了我并不难过
<13-1,TOM WILLIAMS>Look, I can't say I feel bad this guy is dead.

405
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,000
<13-1,TOM WILLIAMS>但他的死跟我无关
<13-1,TOM WILLIAMS>But I had nothing to do with it.

406
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,540
<13-2,BECKETT>尽管他想抢你的未婚妻
<13-2,BECKETT>Even though he was trying to snake your fiancee?

407
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,040
<13-3,TOM>他根本不是个问题
<13-3,TOM>He was out of the picture.

408
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,420
<13-3,TOM>格蕾塔已经做出了选择  她选了我
<13-3,TOM>Greta made her choice, and she picked me.

409
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,640
<13-4,BECKETT>是啊  可惜他不肯罢休
<13-4,BECKETT>Yeah, except he wouldn't take no for an answer.

410
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,910
<13-4,BECKETT>我敢说  你肯定发现了他给她发短信的事
<13-4,BECKETT>You know, I bet you found out that he was texting her,

411
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,570
<13-4,BECKETT>于是决定让他没法再这么干
<13-4,BECKETT>and you decided to make him stop texting her

412
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,970
<13-4,BECKETT>永消后患
<13-4,BECKETT>permanently.

413
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,970
<13-5,TOM>你想错了
<13-5,TOM>Well... You're wrong.

414
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,170
<13-5,TOM>我没碰过他  我都没见过他
<13-5,TOM>I never touched the dude. I never even met him.

415
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,980
<13-6,BECKETT>但这事肯定让你很生气
<13-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but it had to have made you angry.

416
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,690
<13-7,TOM>我说实话
<13-7,TOM>I-I won't lie to you.

417
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,500
<13-7,TOM>这事确实很难接受
<13-7,TOM>This whole thing has been tough.

418
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,110
<13-7,TOM>但是我和格蕾塔要共度余生
<13-7,TOM>But Greta and I are building a life together,

419
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,640
<13-7,TOM>我认为经历了这事  我们会更坚强
<13-7,TOM>and I think we're gonna come out of it stronger--

420
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,120
<13-8,BECKETT>汤姆  你大约多高
<13-8,BECKETT>Tom, about how tall are you?

421
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,850
<13-8,BECKETT>有一米八吗
<13-8,BECKETT>About 6'?

422
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,340
<13-8,BECKETT>一米八六
<13-8,BECKETT>6'2".

423
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,340
<13-10,BECKETT>那么跟这个人差不多高吧
<13-10,BECKETT>So about the same height as this guy, right?

424
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,710
<13-11,TOM>这是什么鬼东西
<13-11,TOM>What the hell is that?

425
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,880
<13-11,TOM>别傻了  那不是我啊
<13-11,TOM>Come on. That's not me.

426
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,950
<13-12,BECKETT>你那晚离开了公寓
<13-12,BECKETT>When you left the apartment that night,

427
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,920
<13-12,BECKETT>接下来的一个半小时去了哪
<13-12,BECKETT>where were you for the next hour and a half?

428
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,750
<13-12,BECKETT>大卫也是在这个时段不明踪迹
<13-12,BECKETT>David was missing for the same amount of time--

429
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
<13-12,BECKETT>凌晨两点半到四点
<13-12,BECKETT>2:30 to 4:00 a.m.

430
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,290
<13-13,TOM>在哈德逊法律图书馆自习
<13-13,TOM>A-at the Hudson Law Library studying.

431
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,010
<13-14,BECKETT>你那个时间去图书馆
<13-14,BECKETT>You were at the library at that hour?

432
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,780
<13-15,TOM>期末期间全天候开放
<13-15,TOM>It's open 24/7 during finals.

433
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,440
<13-15,TOM>你可以去问问图书馆员和其他十个
<13-15,TOM>You can ask the librarian and the ten other people

434
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,580
<13-15,TOM>在那儿自习的人
<13-15,TOM>who were studying there.

435
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,680
<13-16,BECKETT>我会的
<13-16,BECKETT>I will.

436
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,910
<14-1,BECKETT>汤姆的话得到证实了
<14-1,BECKETT>Tom's alibi checks out.

437
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,260
<14-1,BECKETT>他上午三点到六点都在法律图书馆
<14-1,BECKETT>He was at the Law Library between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m.

438
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,380
<14-1,BECKETT>我真以为他就是凶手
<14-1,BECKETT>I really thought that he was our man.

439
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,850
<14-1,BECKETT>大卫·洛克又没有其他的仇家
<14-1,BECKETT>And it's not like David Lock has any other enemies.

440
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,650
<14-1,BECKETT>这点我们已经跟他的朋友和同事证实了
<14-1,BECKETT>I mean, we already confirmed that with his friends and coworkers.

441
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,910
<14-2,CASTLE>那刚刚去世的朋友和同事呢
<14-2,CASTLE>What about recently deceased friends and coworkers?

442
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,410
<14-3,CASTLE>好吧  不管是谁或者什么
<14-3,CASTLE>Okay. Well, whatever or whoever this is,

443
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,580
<14-3,CASTLE>我们能不能至少认同  他看着像僵尸
<14-3,CASTLE>can we at least agree that he looks like a zombie,

444
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,450
<14-3,CASTLE>穿的像僵尸  行为像僵尸
<14-3,CASTLE>he dresses like a zombie, and he acts like a zombie?

445
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,620
<14-4,BECKETT>这对我们有什么帮助
<14-4,BECKETT>And that helps us how?

446
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,590
<14-5,CASTLE>我们现在寻找的是正常的动机
<14-5,CASTLE>We're looking at standard motives here.

447
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,430
<14-5,CASTLE>但驱使这个凶手的不是复仇  贪婪或权利
<14-5,CASTLE>But our killer isn't driven by revenge, greed, or power,

448
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,540
<14-5,CASTLE>如果他把自己当做僵尸就不会如此
<14-5,CASTLE>not if he thinks he's a zombie.

449
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,400
<14-6,BECKETT>要是这么想
<14-6,BECKETT>So then by that line of thinking,

450
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,020
<14-6,BECKETT>他的动机是杀人的原始冲动
<14-6,BECKETT>his motive is a primal urge to kill?

451
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,320
<14-6,BECKETT>他不管杀的是谁  只想大开杀戒
<14-6,BECKETT>Regardless of who the victim is, he kills at random.

452
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,030
<14-7,CASTLE>没错
<14-7,CASTLE>Precisely.

453
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,920
<14-8,BECKETT>那你说说我们在八百万人口的城市里
<14-8,BECKETT>Then how do you propose that we find a random killer

454
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,470
<14-8,BECKETT>要怎么找一个肆意杀人的凶手
<14-8,BECKETT>in a city of eight million people?

455
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,580
<14-9,RYAN>或许可以
<14-9,RYAN>Maybe we start

456
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,140
<14-9,RYAN>从死者失踪期间去了哪查起
<14-9,RYAN>with where the victim went during those missing two hours.

457
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,130
<14-10,CASTLE>快说
<14-10,CASTLE>Do tell.

458
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,470
<14-11,RYAN>实验室分析出了大卫·洛克鞋底
<14-11,RYAN>Well, the lab I.D.'ed a chemical found recently deposited

459
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,930
<14-11,RYAN>新沾上的化学物质
<14-11,RYAN>under the bottom of David Lock's shoes.

460
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,190
<14-12,BECKETT>什么样的化学物质
<14-12,BECKETT>What kind of chemical?

461
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,090
<14-13,RYAN>太不好读了
<14-13,RYAN>Uh, I won't even begin to try to pronounce it,

462
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,700
<14-13,RYAN>但是纽约和新泽西的三家工厂有用到
<14-13,RYAN>but it is used in three factories in New York and New Jersey.

463
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,690
<14-14,BECKETT>大卫被杀当晚
<14-14,BECKETT>The night that David was killed,

464
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,170
<14-14,BECKETT>他去了休斯顿的一家加油站
<14-14,BECKETT>he went to a gas station on Houston.

465
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,080
<14-14,BECKETT>这里哪个工厂离那儿近
<14-14,BECKETT>Which one of those factories is closest to Houston?

466
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,110
<14-15,RYAN>下东区的那一家
<14-15,RYAN>The one on the Lower East Side,

467
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,560
<14-15,RYAN>但是已经闭厂一年了
<14-15,RYAN>but it's been closed for over a year.

468
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,900
<14-16,BECKETT>我们走
<14-16,BECKETT>Let's go.

469
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,660
<15-1,CASTLE>我们现在能够确定这里确实是废弃了
<15-1,CASTLE>Well, we know now this is, in fact, an abandoned factory...

470
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,960
<15-1,CASTLE>就坐落在一个落寞  凄凉的小巷里
<15-1,CASTLE>in a desolate, godforsaken alley.

471
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,180
<15-2,BECKETT>又开始胡思乱想了吧  卡塞尔
<15-2,BECKETT>Imagination getting the better of you, Castle?

472
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,380
<15-2,BECKETT>没有啊  没有
<15-2,BECKETT>No, no. Of course not.

473
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,960
<15-3,CASTLE>只是希望没这么大老远白跑一趟
<15-3,CASTLE>Just wish we had more to show for our efforts. That's all.

474
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,560
<15-4,BECKETT>我不能理解的是
<15-4,BECKETT>The thing that I don't get is,

475
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,680
<15-4,BECKETT>大卫·洛克那样的货币交易员干嘛跑到这儿来
<15-4,BECKETT>why would a currency trader like David Lock come down here?

476
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,610
<15-4,BECKETT>真是完全说不通
<15-4,BECKETT>It just doesn't make any sense.

477
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,340
<15-5,CASTLE>除非他有我们不了解的阴暗面
<15-5,CASTLE>Unless he had a dark side we know nothing about.

478
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,330
<15-6,BECKETT>比如
<15-6,BECKETT>Like what?

479
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,510
<15-7,CASTLE>我只知道正常人
<15-7,CASTLE>All I know is that normal people

480
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,090
<15-7,CASTLE>是不会凌晨两点跑来这种地方
<15-7,CASTLE>don't come to places like this at 2:00 a.m. in the morning.

481
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,750
<15-7,CASTLE>说实话  我想走了  你呢
<15-7,CASTLE>In fact, I think I've seen enough. Haven't you?

482
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,210
<15-8,BECKETT>等等  你听到了吗
<15-8,BECKETT>Wait. Do you hear that?

483
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,930
<15-9,CASTLE>我才不会被骗呢
<15-9,CASTLE>I'm not falling for that.

484
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,040
<15-10,BECKETT>不是闹着玩的  你听
<15-10,BECKETT>No, no, no, I'm serious. Listen.

485
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,150
<15-11,CASTLE>-脚步声  -是啊
<15-11,CASTLE>- Footsteps. - Yeah.

486
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,710
<15-12,BECKETT>而且有很多人
<15-12,BECKETT>Lots of 'em.

487
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,300
<15-13,CASTLE>老天啊
<15-13,CASTLE>Oh, my god!

488
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,420
<15-14,WOMAN>他们在追我们  他们在追我们
<15-14,WOMAN>They're after us! They're after us!

489
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,520
<15-15,CASTLE>谁啊
<15-15,CASTLE>Who is?

490
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,730
<15-16,MAN>你们干嘛呢  别傻站着  跑啊
<15-16,MAN>What are you people doing? Don't just stand there! Run!

491
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,860
<15-17,BECKETT>快走
<15-17,BECKETT>Come on!

492
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,250
<15-17,BECKETT>怎么回事啊
<15-17,BECKETT>What the hell is going on?

493
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,020
<15-18,CASTLE>那是  那是一群僵尸啊
<15-18,CASTLE>That's--that's a zombie-- that's a zombie horde.

494
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,480
<15-19,BECKETT>才没有什么僵尸呢
<15-19,BECKETT>There's no such thing as zombies.

495
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,790
<15-20,CASTLE>不用提醒你照头爆吧
<15-20,CASTLE>I'm sure I don't have to tell you to aim for the head.

496
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,530
<15-21,CASTLE>贝克特  后面也有  我们被包围了
<15-21,CASTLE>Beckett, they're behind us. We're surrounded.

497
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,670
<15-21,CASTLE>老天啊
<15-21,CASTLE>Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.

498
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,690
<15-21,CASTLE>你的子弹可不够
<15-21,CASTLE>You don't have enough bullets.

499
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,000
<16-1,CASTLE>这里就是僵尸世界大战的地零点了
<16-1,CASTLE>It's ground zero for world war z.

500
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:35,930
<16-2,CASTLE>躲到我身后
<16-2,CASTLE>Get behind me.

501
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,190
<16-2,CASTLE>我们得杀出一条血路
<16-2,CASTLE>We'll have to fight our way out.

502
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,740
<16-2,CASTLE>这太糟糕了
<16-2,CASTLE>This is so not cool.

503
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,160
<16-3,BECKETT>这绝对不是真的
<16-3,BECKETT>There's no way this is real.

504
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,050
<16-3,BECKETT>纽约警局
<16-3,BECKETT>NYPD!

505
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,970
<16-3,BECKETT>立刻停下来
<16-3,BECKETT>Stop moving now.

506
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,990
<16-4,BECKETT>不要再扮僵尸了
<16-4,BECKETT>And stop pretending to be zombies.

507
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,060
<16-5,PAUL>别激动啊
<16-5,PAUL>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

508
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,790
<16-5,PAUL>我们就是在玩行尸走肉
<16-5,PAUL>We're just zombie walking here.

509
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,220
<16-5,PAUL>你们什么
<16-5,PAUL>You're what?

510
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,440
<16-5,PAUL>行尸走肉
<16-5,PAUL>Z-zombie walking.

511
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,090
<16-7,PAUL>类似于扮装抓人游戏
<16-7,PAUL>It's like an amped up form of tag.

512
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,460
<16-7,PAUL>我们扮成僵尸  去追正常人
<16-7,PAUL>We--we dress up like zombies, and we chase the normals.

513
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,950
<16-8,WOMAN>我们就是正常人
<16-8,WOMAN>That would be us.

514
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,310
<16-9,PAUL>我们抓到他们就可以转化他们
<16-9,PAUL>Yeah, yeah, if we tag 'em, we turn 'em,

515
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,740
<16-9,PAUL>那他们就也变成僵尸了
<16-9,PAUL>and then they become zombies, too.

516
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,080
<16-9,PAUL>如果你们这是为了我们没有许可证的事
<16-9,PAUL>Look, if this is because we didn't get a permit, I--

517
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,950
<16-9,PAUL>不是
<16-9,PAUL>It's not!

518
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,950
<16-10,BECKETT>你们都要马上跟我回警局去
<16-10,BECKETT>You're all coming with me. Now.

519
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,610
<16-11,CASTLE>怎么没人告诉我这件事
<16-11,CASTLE>how did I not know about this?!

520
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,690
<16-11,CASTLE>好逼真  是你自己做的吗
<16-11,CASTLE>This is outstanding. Did you do this yourself?

521
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,880
<17-1,CASTLE>做为僵尸脑残粉  我懂
<17-1,CASTLE>Being a fan of zombie lore, I get it.

522
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,140
<17-1,CASTLE>真正做僵尸有什么意思啊
<17-1,CASTLE>But what's the appeal of being a zombie?

523
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,270
<17-1,CASTLE>看看这个人
<17-1,CASTLE>Like look at this guy.

524
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,730
<17-1,CASTLE>谁会想在腐烂无意识的状态下活着
<17-1,CASTLE>Who would want to be alive in a decayed, mindless state?

525
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,610
<17-1,CASTLE>做个吸血鬼  我能理解
<17-1,CASTLE>Being a vampire-- that I understand.

526
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,970
<17-1,CASTLE>那是走向不死的浪漫意淫之旅
<17-1,CASTLE>That's the romantic route to immortality.

527
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,170
<17-1,CASTLE>可以说是有品位的怪物
<17-1,CASTLE>The, uh, gentlemen's monster, as it were.

528
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,200
<17-2,BECKETT>说到怪物
<17-2,BECKETT>Speaking of monsters,

529
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,100
<17-2,BECKETT>这里的僵尸没有跟凶手照片匹配的
<17-2,BECKETT>none of these zombies match the photo of our killer.

530
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,510
<17-3,CASTLE>或许他在尝试新造型
<17-3,CASTLE>Maybe he's trying out a new look.

531
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,010
<17-3,CASTLE>你呢
<17-3,CASTLE>How about you?

532
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,070
<17-3,CASTLE>如果你能成为超自然生物  想做什么
<17-3,CASTLE>If you could be any supernatural creature, what would it be?

533
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,580
<17-4,BECKETT>范海辛  毫无疑问
<17-4,BECKETT>Van Helsing. No question.

535
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,350
<17-5,CASTLE>怪物杀手  很合适
<17-5,CASTLE>Monster slayer. Befitting.

536
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,680
<17-6,BECKETT>想象一下
<17-6,BECKETT>And imagine,

537
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,860
<17-6,BECKETT>我们正追捕的这个怪物
<17-6,BECKETT>the monster that we are hunting

538
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,360
<17-6,BECKETT>可能就在这屋里
<17-6,BECKETT>might be in this very room.

539
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,260
<18-1,RYAN>姑娘们  感谢你们的配合
<18-1,RYAN>All right, ladies, thanks for your help.

540
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,680
<18-2,ESPOSITO>搞不懂那双鞋为什么配那件上衣
<18-2,ESPOSITO>I don't know about those shoes with that top.

541
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,320
<18-2,ESPOSITO>我是说我会选露趾鞋
<18-2,ESPOSITO>I'm just sayin'. I'd have went open-toed.

542
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,300
<18-3,BECKETT>你们比我们进展顺利吗
<18-3,BECKETT>Are you guys having more luck than we are?

543
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,010
<18-4,ESPOSITO>丝毫没进展
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Not at all.

544
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,470
<18-4,ESPOSITO>还有
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Oh, and guess what.

545
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,670
<18-4,ESPOSITO>这些傻蛋里没一个是真僵尸
<18-4,ESPOSITO>None of these knuckleheads are real zombies.

546
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,810
<18-5,RYAN>我认为我同事的意思是
<18-5,RYAN>I think what my colleague means to say is

547
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,800
<18-5,RYAN>没人认得出视频上的僵尸
<18-5,RYAN>that no one recognized our zombie from the video

548
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,950
<18-5,RYAN>和死者大卫·洛克
<18-5,RYAN>or our victim David Lock.

549
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,730
<18-6,BECKETT>如果大卫不是僵尸群里的一员
<18-6,BECKETT>If David wasn't a part of the zombie crowd,

550
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,460
<18-6,BECKETT>那他在那里干什么
<18-6,BECKETT>then what was he doing down there?

551
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
<19-1,RHETT>他肯定不是我们的成员
<19-1,RHETT>He definitely wasn't part of our group,

552
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,500
<19-1,RHETT>我敢确定
<19-1,RHETT>I can tell you that.

553
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,370
<19-2,BECKETT>你呢  你认识他吗
<19-2,BECKETT>What about you? Do you recognize him?

554
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,350
<19-3,PAUL>什么
<19-3,PAUL>What?

555
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,820
<19-4,BECKETT>保罗  你是不是嗑药了
<19-4,BECKETT>Paul, are you high right now?

556
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,580
<19-5,PAUL>没有  没有
<19-5,PAUL>Whoa. Whoa. Hey now.

557
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,370

<19-5,PAUL>Uh... Where's that...

558
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,440
<19-5,PAUL>这么想
<19-5,PAUL>coming from?

559
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,280
<19-5,PAUL>没  没  当然没
<19-5,PAUL>No. No, of course not.

560
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,720
<19-6,BECKETT>喂
<19-6,BECKETT>Hello.

561
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,940
<19-7,PAUL>对
<19-7,PAUL>Right. Um...

562
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,810
<19-7,PAUL>我不认识这家伙
<19-7,PAUL>Yeah, yeah, I-I don't know this dude.

563
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,110
<19-7,PAUL>他不是僵尸  也不是普通人
<19-7,PAUL>He's not a-a zombie or a-a normal.

564
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,500
<19-7,PAUL>听着
<19-7,PAUL>Listen,

565
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,550
<19-8,RHETT>还要很久吗
<19-8,RHETT>will this take much longer?

566
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,690
<19-8,RHETT>我早上还得上课
<19-8,RHETT>I have a class in the morning.

567
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,580
<19-9,CASTLE>-你是学生吗  -我是老师
<19-9,CASTLE>- You're a student? - A teacher.

568
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,410
<19-10,RHETT>是吗
<19-10,RHETT>Really?

569
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
<19-12,BECKETT>人类学的助理教授
<19-12,BECKETT>Assistant professor of anthropology.

570
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,890
<19-13,RHETT>我认为我们对僵尸的迷恋
<19-13,RHETT>I believe our fascination with zombies

571
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,390
<19-13,RHETT>是一种文化现象
<19-13,RHETT>is a cultural phenomenon,

572
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,610
<19-13,RHETT>对现代生活内心麻痹的一种映射
<19-13,RHETT>a commentary on the inner numbness of modern life.

573
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,380
<19-14,BECKETT>好
<19-14,BECKETT>Yeah, okay.

574
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,690
<19-14,BECKETT>你们谁认得这个
<19-14,BECKETT>Do either of you recognize this,

575
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,540
<19-14,BECKETT>僵尸
<19-14,BECKETT>uh, zombie?

576
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,480
<19-15,RHETT>那是凯尔
<19-15,RHETT>That's Kyle.

577
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,440
<19-15,RHETT>凯尔·詹宁斯
<19-15,RHETT>Kyle Jennings.

578
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,820
<20-1,ESPOSITO>纽约警局  凯尔·詹宁斯
<20-1,ESPOSITO>NYPD! Kyle Jennings!

579
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,180
<20-2,ESPOSITO>是他吗
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Is that him?

580
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,650
<20-3,RYAN>对  就是他
<20-3,RYAN>Yeah, that's him.

581
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,390
<20-3,RYAN>凯尔
<20-3,RYAN>Kyle.

582
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,900
<20-4,RYAN>他死了
<20-4,RYAN>He's dead.

583
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,640
<21-1,BECKETT>那死因我们知道吗
<21-1,BECKETT>So do we have cause of death?

584
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,000
<21-2,PERLMUTTER>你说"我们"  其实指的是我
<21-2,PERLMUTTER>I assume by "We," you mean me.

585
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,290
<21-2,PERLMUTTER>等我解剖后才能知道
<21-2,PERLMUTTER>I'll have answers after I cut him open.

586
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,710
<21-3,CASTLE>人真好
<21-3,CASTLE>Charming.

587
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,970
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>我们都是臭脾气  卡塞尔  习惯就好
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>We're all meat, Castle. Get over it.

588
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,420
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>我现在能得出的结论是  他的牙和咬痕能对上
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>What I can tell you is, his teeth match the bite marks,

589
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,570
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>而且他衣服上的血迹是死者的
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>and the blood on his clothes came from the victim.

590
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,110
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>凯尔·詹宁斯就是凶手
<21-4,PERLMUTTER>Kyle Jennings is your killer.

591
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,700
<21-5,BECKETT>问题是  谁杀了他
<21-5,BECKETT>Well, the question is, who killed him?

592
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,300
<21-6,PERLMUTTER>那不一直都是问题吗
<21-6,PERLMUTTER>Isn't that always the question?

593
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,630
<21-7,CASTLE>只是...
<21-7,CASTLE>Uh, you know, just--

594
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,480
<21-8,PERLMUTTER>干什么  卡塞尔
<21-8,PERLMUTTER>What is it, Castle?

595
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,400
<21-9,CASTLE>不  我只是想知道
<21-9,CASTLE>No, I was just wondering,

596
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,190
<21-9,CASTLE>他死前  他的举止跟僵尸一样
<21-9,CASTLE>before this man died, he was behaving exactly like a zombie.

597
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,860
<21-9,CASTLE>有没有医学的方法可以确定
<21-9,CASTLE>Is there any medical way to determine...

598
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,400
<21-9,CASTLE>他是不是真的是...
<21-9,CASTLE>if he actually was...

599
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,690
<21-9,CASTLE>僵尸
<21-9,CASTLE>one?

600
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,970
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>他怎么会出现在我的停尸室
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>W-w-why is he in my morgue?

601
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,930
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>卡塞尔  僵尸是不存在的
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>There are no zombies, Castle.

602
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,230
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>他只是个男人  之前活着
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>This is a man. He was a live man.

603
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,390
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>现在死了
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>Now he's a dead man.

604
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,350
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>故事结束
<21-10,PERLMUTTER>End of story.

605
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,670
<21-11,CASTLE>他是活死人
<21-11,CASTLE>It's undead!

606
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,110
<21-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  叫支援
<21-13,BECKETT>Castle, call for backup!

607
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,380
<21-14,CASTLE>怎么...
<21-14,CASTLE>How--how do I--

608
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,180
<21-15,PERLMUTTER>播9
<21-15,PERLMUTTER>9. 9.

609
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,870
<21-15,PERLMUTTER>9
<21-15,PERLMUTTER>9.

610
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,460
<21-16,CASTLE>有没有在逃僵尸的警用代码
<21-16,CASTLE>Is there a police code for zombie on the loose?

611
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,090
<22-1,BECKETT>根据急诊室的最新报告
<22-1,BECKETT>So based on the latest report from the E.R.,

612
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,370
<22-1,BECKETT>凯尔·詹宁斯被转到重症监护室了
<22-1,BECKETT>Kyle Jennings was transferred up to I.C.U.

613
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,040
<22-1,BECKETT>他情况稳定了  但镇定剂药性还没过
<22-1,BECKETT>He is stable but under sedation.

614
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,420
<22-2,RYAN>我跟你说  这个人已经死了
<22-2,RYAN>I'm telling you, that guy was dead.

615
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
<22-3,ESPOSITO>记得提醒我别在你面前被鸡骨头卡住喉咙
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Remind me never to choke on a chicken bone in front of you.

616
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,060
<22-4,RYAN>你也检查过他的脉搏  医护人员也查了
<22-4,RYAN>Hey, you checked that guy. So did the paramedics.

617
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,530
<22-5,BECKETT>别吵  我相信
<22-5,BECKETT>Whoa. You guys, I'm sure

618
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,330
<22-5,BECKETT>肯定会有合理的医学解释的
<22-5,BECKETT>that there's a medical explanation for it.

619
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,970
<22-6,CASTLE>解释倒是有
<22-6,CASTLE>Oh, there's an explanation, all right.

620
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,120
<22-7,BECKETT>除了那个
<22-7,BECKETT>Besides that one.

621
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,590
<22-8,CASTLE>你也在那里  你也看见了
<22-8,CASTLE>Come on. You were there. You saw it.

622
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,860
<22-8,CASTLE>他死而复生了
<22-8,CASTLE>He rose from the dead.

623
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,800
<22-9,BECKETT>他不是死而复生  卡塞尔
<22-9,BECKETT>He didn't rise from the dead, Castle.

624
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,430
<22-9,BECKETT>他本来就没死
<22-9,BECKETT>He wasn't dead in the first place.

625
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,190
<22-10,ESPOSITO>没错  他不是僵尸  卡塞尔
<22-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, he's not a zombie, Castle.

626
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,650
<22-10,ESPOSITO>他只是个谋杀犯
<22-10,ESPOSITO>He's just a murderer.

627
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,220
<22-11,CASTLE>那他的动机是什么
<22-11,CASTLE>Well, then what was his motive for murder,

628
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,690
<22-11,CASTLE>埃斯波西托警探
<22-11,CASTLE>Detective Esposito?

629
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,930
<22-12,CASTLE>凯尔是卖保险的
<22-12,CASTLE>Kyle sold insurance.

630
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,220
<22-12,CASTLE>没有前科
<22-12,CASTLE>He had no criminal record.

631
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,060
<22-12,CASTLE>没有证据显示他认识死者
<22-12,CASTLE>There's no evidence he even knew our victim.

632
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,550
<22-13,BECKETT>他是个有着人类动机的人类杀手
<22-13,BECKETT>He's a human killer with a human motive.

633
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,720
<22-14,CASTLE>也可能是个有着僵尸动机的僵尸杀手
<22-14,CASTLE>Or he's a zombie killer with a zombie motive.

635
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,820
<22-16,CASTLE>美味的脑子
<22-16,CASTLE>Tasty brains.

636
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,650
<22-17,RYAN>卡塞尔  你真的相信
<22-17,RYAN>You know, Castle, do you really believe

637
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,720
<22-17,RYAN>僵尸的说法吗  因为
<22-17,RYAN>in all this zombie stuff, because I--

638
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,660
<22-17,RYAN>我以我死去奶奶的名义发誓凯尔·詹宁斯死了
<22-17,RYAN>I would swear on my nana's grave that Kyle Jennings was dead.

639
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,350
<22-17,RYAN>不
<22-17,RYAN>No.

640
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,910
<22-18,CASTLE>你知道我相信什么吗
<22-18,CASTLE>You know what I do believe in?

641
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,240
<22-18,CASTLE>把贝克特逼疯
<22-18,CASTLE>Driving Beckett crazy.

642
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,740
<22-19,RYAN>我不得不说  很高兴看到你们俩
<22-19,RYAN>I have to say, it's good to see you guys

643
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,590
<22-19,RYAN>再次和好
<22-19,RYAN>hitting it off again.

644
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,500
<22-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看来我们能从当事人那
<22-20,BECKETT>Well, Castle, looks like we will get our motive

645
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,560
<22-20,BECKETT>直接问出动机了
<22-20,BECKETT>straight from the source.

646
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,750
<22-20,BECKETT>凯尔·詹宁斯先生已经醒了
<22-20,BECKETT>Mr. Kyle Jennings is officially awake.

647
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,570
<23-1,BECKETT>凯尔  我是贝克特警探  这是卡塞尔先生
<23-1,BECKETT>Kyle, I'm detective Beckett. This is Mr. Castle.

648
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,690
<23-2,KYLE JENNINGS>我怎么会在医院  为什么有警察守在外面
<23-2,KYLE JENNINGS>What am I doing here? Why are there cops outside?

649
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,160
<23-2,KYLE JENNINGS>没人告诉我这是怎么回事
<23-2,KYLE JENNINGS>No one's telling me anything.

650
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,560
<23-2,KYLE JENNINGS>是我被打劫了还是怎么
<23-2,KYLE JENNINGS>What, was I mugged or something?

651
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,870
<23-3,BECKETT>我们要问你几个关于大卫·洛克的问题
<23-3,BECKETT>We need to ask you a few questions about David Lock.

652
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,560
<23-5,BECKETT>-谁  -照片上这人
<23-5,BECKETT>- Who? - This man.

653
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,540
<23-6,KYLE>我不认识他
<23-6,KYLE>I don't know him.

654
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,380
<23-7,BECKETT>两天前  他也参加了行尸走肉
<23-7,BECKETT>Two nights ago, he went on a zombie walk.

655
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,550
<23-7,BECKETT>你们在那见过吗
<23-7,BECKETT>Did the two of you meet there?

656
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,030
<23-8,KYLE>我不是说了吗  从来没见过这人
<23-8,KYLE>I'm telling you, I've never seen the guy before.

657
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,860
<23-8,KYLE>到底是怎么回事
<23-8,KYLE>What is this about?

658
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,370
<23-9,BECKETT>他被谋杀了
<23-9,BECKETT>He was murdered.

659
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,380
<23-9,BECKETT>活活被打死的
<23-9,BECKETT>Beaten to death.

660
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,380
<23-10,CASTLE>行尸走肉时到底发生了什么
<23-10,CASTLE>What happened at that zombie walk?

661
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,480
<23-11,KYLE>记不得了
<23-11,KYLE>I can't remember.

662
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,750
<23-12,BECKETT>你能记得的最后一件事是什么
<23-12,BECKETT>Well, what's the last thing you do remember?

663
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,200
<23-13,KYLE>我弄好装扮去参加活动
<23-13,KYLE>Uh, I... got dressed to head over there.

664
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,630
<23-13,KYLE>然后就在停尸房醒来了
<23-13,KYLE>The next thing I know, I woke up in the morgue.

665
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,250
<23-14,BECKETT>你那晚喝酒或者嗑药了吗
<23-14,BECKETT>Did you drink or do drugs that night?

666
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,290
<23-15,KYLE>我不喝酒不嗑药的
<23-15,KYLE>I don't do that stuff. Look...

667
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,050
<23-15,KYLE>我没有伤害任何人  真的
<23-15,KYLE>I didn't hurt anyone, okay?

668
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,060
<23-15,KYLE>我不会干那种事的
<23-15,KYLE>I would never do that.

669
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,470
<23-15,KYLE>我只是什么都记不得了
<23-15,KYLE>I just-- I don't remember anything.

670
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,640
<23-16,BECKETT>你衣服上有被害人的血
<23-16,BECKETT>Well, the victim's blood was found on your clothes,

671
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,310
<23-16,BECKETT>咬痕和你的牙齿也吻合
<23-16,BECKETT>Bite marks match your teeth,

672
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,370
<23-16,BECKETT>他手里还攥着你衬衫的袖口
<23-16,BECKETT>The cuff of your shirt was clutched in his hand,

673
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,770
<23-16,BECKETT>还有监控录像拍到了凶手的样子
<23-16,BECKETT>And a security camera caught our killer on tape.

674
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,380
<23-16,BECKETT>这是你吗  凯尔
<23-16,BECKETT>Is that you, Kyle?

675
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,700
<23-17,KYLE>是
<23-17,KYLE>Yes.

676
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,720
<23-17,KYLE>是我没错
<23-17,KYLE>That's me.

677
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,500
<23-18,BECKETT>我看你得请个律师了
<23-18,BECKETT>I think you're gonna need a lawyer.

678
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,200
<23-19,CASTLE>凯尔无缘无故杀了一个他没见过的人
<23-19,CASTLE>So Kyle killed someone he never met for no reason.

679
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
<23-19,CASTLE>难道我们要相信这样的结果吗
<23-19,CASTLE>Is that what we're supposed to believe?

680
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,270
<23-20,BECKETT>你不是说僵尸就是这样吗
<23-20,BECKETT>Well, isn't that what you said zombies do?

681
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,240
<23-21,CASTLE>很伤心地说
<23-21,CASTLE>It is with a sad heart, I say that

682
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,500
<23-21,CASTLE>那人不是僵尸
<23-21,CASTLE>That man is no zombie.

683
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,140
<23-22,BECKETT>就算他死而复生也不是吗
<23-22,BECKETT>Oh, even though he rose from the dead?

684
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,220
<23-23,CASTLE>是人都知道  变成僵尸之后
<23-23,CASTLE>It's common knowledge, when you turn into a zombie,

685
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,100
<23-23,CASTLE>没法再变回来
<23-23,CASTLE>you cannot turn back.

686
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,400
<23-24,BECKETT>所以你同意
<23-24,BECKETT>So you concede to the fact that

687
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,060
<23-24,BECKETT>这些事都能用医学来解释咯
<23-24,BECKETT>there's a medical explanation to all of this?

688
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,160
<23-25,CASTLE>我什么都没认
<23-25,CASTLE>I concede to nothing

689
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,520
<23-25,CASTLE>但我肯定凯尔还有所隐瞒
<23-25,CASTLE>except that Kyle is not telling us the whole story.

690
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,590
<23-26,BECKETT>你认为他记得
<23-26,BECKETT>You think he remembers?

691
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,760
<23-27,CASTLE>这种改变人生的事件但凡发生
<23-27,CASTLE>When a life-altering moment occurs,

692
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,610
<23-27,CASTLE>人都会记得
<23-27,CASTLE>people remember.

693
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,160
<23-28,BECKETT>也许是因为太重大  一时处理不来
<23-28,BECKETT>Well, maybe it's too big to deal with.

694
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,120
<23-28,BECKETT>也许他
<23-28,BECKETT>Maybe he...

695
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,590
<23-28,BECKETT>现在还没法面对
<23-28,BECKETT>can't face it just yet.

696
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,100
<23-29,CASTLE>你觉得他以后能吗
<23-29,CASTLE>Well, you think he ever will be?

697
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,520
<23-30,BECKETT>希望如此
<23-30,BECKETT>Hopefully,

698
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,060
<23-30,BECKETT>前提是他觉得安全
<23-30,BECKETT>if he feels safe.

699
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,450
<23-31,BECKETT>帕穆特
<23-31,BECKETT>Perlmutter?

700
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,020
<23-32,BECKETT>你在这干嘛呢
<23-32,BECKETT>What are you doing here?

701
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,040
<23-33,PERLMUTTER>我来照顾我的病人  凯尔·詹宁斯
<23-33,PERLMUTTER>I came to tend to one of my patients--Kyle Jennings.

702
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,730
<23-34,CASTLE>你觉得这是个好主意吗
<23-34,CASTLE>Do you think that's a good idea?

703
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,440
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>不怕告诉你  我治活人
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>I'll have you know, I'm perfectly capable

704
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,020
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>一样拿手
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>of treating living patients.

705
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,450
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>我只是不乐意
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>I simply prefer not to.

706
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,930
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>这次例外
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>I made an exception here

707
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,120
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>是因为他的血液检测结果很不寻常
<23-35,PERLMUTTER>because the results of his blood work are quite unusual.

708
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:44,820
<23-36,BECKETT>什么意思
<23-36,BECKETT>What do you mean?

709
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,430
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>凯尔·詹宁斯身体里有莨菪碱
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>Kyle Jennings had scopolamine in his system,

710
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,120
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>小剂量的莨菪碱可以用来治晕动症
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>which, in small doses, is used to treat motion sickness.

711
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,300
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>剂量大的话  能影响中枢神经
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>In larger doses, it acts on the central nervous system

712
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,470
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>使人的行为极易服从控制和影响
<23-37,PERLMUTTER>to promote compliant and suggestible behavior.

713
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,170
<23-38,CASTLE>有多容易被影响
<23-38,CASTLE>Exactly how suggestible?

714
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,740
<23-39,PERLMUTTER>基本上让你干啥就干啥
<23-39,PERLMUTTER>You'll basically do whatever you're told.

715
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,970
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>就像迷奸药一样
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>It's like a date-rape drug,

716
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,760
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>不过被害人意识清醒
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>only the victim remains conscious.

717
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,970
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>药效一过
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>And when the drug wears off,

718
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,130
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>被害人就什么都不记得了
<23-40,PERLMUTTER>you have no recollection of what happened.

719
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,580
<23-41,CASTLE>有没有可能有人给凯尔下药了
<23-41,CASTLE>Is it possible somebody slipped Kyle that drug?

720
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,490
<23-42,PERLMUTTER>我觉得很有可能
<23-42,PERLMUTTER>I think it's highly probable that they did.

721
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,680
<23-43,BECKETT>他是什么时候服了莨菪碱的
<23-43,BECKETT>What time do you think he was given the scopolamine?

722
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,300
<23-44,PERLMUTTER>凶案当晚2点45到3点45之间
<23-44,PERLMUTTER>Between 2:45 and 3:45 the night of the murder.

723
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,820
<23-45,BECKETT>正好是参加行尸走肉的时候
<23-45,BECKETT>That's when he was on that zombie walk.

724
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,270
<23-46,CASTLE>行尸走肉队伍里面有人对他下药
<23-46,CASTLE>Someone on the zombie walk drugged Kyle

725
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,530
<23-46,CASTLE>让他去杀大卫
<23-46,CASTLE>and sent him after David.

726
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,980
<23-46,CASTLE>凯尔是无辜的
<23-46,CASTLE>Kyle's innocent.

727
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,250
<24-1,CASTLE>这案子根本就不是随机的僵尸伤人
<24-1,CASTLE>Far from a random active zombie mayhem,

728
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,340
<24-1,CASTLE>而是深思熟虑的蓄意谋杀
<24-1,CASTLE>this murder was fiendishly deliberate.

729
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,460
<24-1,CASTLE>谋划的天衣无缝
<24-1,CASTLE>It was meticulously planned...

730
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,830
<24-2,BECKETT>此人有强烈动机
<24-2,BECKETT>By someone with a powerful motive...

731
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,090
<24-3,CASTLE>还得能弄到那种药
<24-3,CASTLE>With access to those drugs...

732
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,710
<24-4,BECKETT>同时参加了行尸走肉
<24-4,BECKETT>Who was also at our zombie walk.

733
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,860
<24-5,CASTLE>但我们已经讯问过那些人了
<24-5,CASTLE>But we interviewed those people.

734
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,340
<24-5,CASTLE>没有任何证据表明大卫认识他们
<24-5,CASTLE>There's no evidence that David knew any of them

735
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,910
<24-5,CASTLE>又或者和僵尸事件有关
<24-5,CASTLE>or had anything to do with the zombie scene.

736
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,120
<24-6,BECKETT>我们知道他下去了
<24-6,BECKETT>Well, we know he was down there.

737
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,610
<24-6,BECKETT>总得有个原因吧
<24-6,BECKETT>He had to have gone there for a reason.

738
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,860
<24-7,BECKETT>最好还是追查下药这条线
<24-7,BECKETT>Maybe our best bet is to work this through the drug angle.

739
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,050
<24-8,RYAN>已经在做了
<24-8,RYAN>Uh, I got started on that,

740
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,390
<24-8,RYAN>我做了一些关于莨菪碱的调查
<24-8,RYAN>and I did some research on scopolamine.

741
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,750
<24-10,RYAN>-好样的  -副作用一大串
<24-10,RYAN>- Nice. - Quite the list of side effects,

742
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,690
<24-10,RYAN>包括犯困  混乱  口齿不清
<24-10,RYAN>including drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech,

743
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,570
<24-10,RYAN>还有死亡
<24-10,RYAN>death.

744
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,630
<24-11,BECKETT>道上能弄到这种药吗
<24-11,BECKETT>Is it available on the street?

745
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,520
<24-12,RYAN>不常见  但是能弄到  还有
<24-12,RYAN>It's uncommon, but it's out there, and get this--

746
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,110
<24-12,RYAN>这种药被叫做"僵尸药"
<24-12,RYAN>users refer to it as "The zombie drug."

747
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,850
<24-13,CASTLE>我刚好认识一个能为我们答疑解惑的僵尸
<24-13,CASTLE>And I know just the zombie to tell us all about it.

748
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,260
<25-1,PAUL>又怎么了  我回答过你们的问话了
<25-1,PAUL>Hey, what is this? I answered all your guys' questions.

749
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,940
<25-2,BECKETT>你上次来的时候  服了什么
<25-2,BECKETT>When you were here last time, what were you on?

750
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,280
<25-3,PAUL>服了
<25-3,PAUL>On?

751
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,710
<25-3,PAUL>你  什么意思
<25-3,PAUL>What do you-- what do you mean?

752
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,800
<25-4,BECKETT>保罗  你明显嗑药了
<25-4,BECKETT>You were under the influence, Paul.

753
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,960
<25-5,CASTLE>嗑得都找不到北了
<25-5,CASTLE>Heavily under the influence.

754
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,750
<25-5,CASTLE>是莨菪碱吗
<25-5,CASTLE>Was it scopolamine?

755
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,580
<25-6,PAUL>什么东西
<25-6,PAUL>Whoa. What now?

756
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
<25-7,BECKETT>你是不是用了僵尸药
<25-7,BECKETT>Do you use the zombie drug?

757
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,150
<25-8,PAUL>这个
<25-8,PAUL>I suppose that's...

758
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,920
<25-8,PAUL>有可能
<25-8,PAUL>possible.

759
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,570
<25-9,BECKETT>其它僵尸也用吗
<25-9,BECKETT>Do any of the other zombies use it?

760
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,450
<25-10,PAUL>有些用
<25-10,PAUL>Some do.

761
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,750
<25-10,PAUL>有人说那能让僵尸体验更过瘾
<25-10,PAUL>Some say it enhances the zombie experience.

762
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,930
<25-11,BECKETT>你从哪弄到的
<25-11,BECKETT>Where did you get it?

763
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,800
<25-12,PAUL>有人卖啊
<25-12,PAUL>A guy down there sells the stuff.

764
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,660
<25-13,BECKETT>谁  叫什么
<25-13,BECKETT>Who? What's his name?

765
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,000
<25-14,PAUL>不知道  又没问过
<25-14,PAUL>I don't know. I never asked.

766
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
<25-15,BECKETT>描述一下长相
<25-15,BECKETT>Well, describe him.

767
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,190
<25-16,PAUL>黑头发  挺高的  1米8多
<25-16,PAUL>Dark hair, tall, over 6'.

768
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,960
<25-17,BECKETT>是他吗
<25-17,BECKETT>Is this him?

769
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,610
<25-18,PAUL>没错  就是他
<25-18,PAUL>Yeah, that's him.

770
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,380
<26-1,BECKETT>感谢你再次赶来  汤姆
<26-1,BECKETT>Thanks for coming in again, Tom.

771
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,790
<26-2,TOM>没事  虽然我不知道自己能帮上什么忙
<26-2,TOM>Sure. Though I'm not sure what I can do.

772
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,880
<26-2,TOM>我听说你们抓到凶手了
<26-2,TOM>I heard you caught the guy.

773
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,360
<26-3,BECKETT>嗯  但我们还需要你帮忙
<26-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we just needed you to help us

774
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,960
<26-3,BECKETT>将些许零星的碎片拼起来
<26-3,BECKETT>tie up a few loose ends.

775
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,710
<26-3,BECKETT>这就是我们的嫌疑犯凯尔·詹宁斯
<26-3,BECKETT>So this is our suspect-- Kyle Jennings.

776
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,300
<26-4,TOM>我记得你上次问过了
<26-4,TOM>Yeah, I remember from last time.

777
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,390
<26-5,BECKETT>你说你从没见过他
<26-5,BECKETT>Now you said that you've never seen him before.

778
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,500
<26-6,TOM>他挺难让人忘记的  不是吗
<26-6,TOM>Well... he'd be hard to miss, right?

779
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,910
<26-7,CASTLE>那真是太有趣了  因为凯尔说他看见你了
<26-7,CASTLE>Yeah, that's funny, 'cause Kyle said he saw you.

780
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,240
<26-8,BECKETT>对  他说你也参与了行尸走肉
<26-8,BECKETT>Yeah, he says you were at the zombie walk.

781
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,720
<26-8,BECKETT>你从没告诉我们  你是僵尸亚文化的一份子
<26-8,BECKETT>You never told us that you were a part of the zombie subculture.

782
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,990
<26-9,TOM>警探  我在读法律预科
<26-9,TOM>Detective, I'm pre-law.

783
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,950
<26-9,TOM>我可没时间专研文化
<26-9,TOM>I-I have no time for regular culture,

784
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,140
<26-9,TOM>更别说是亚文化了
<26-9,TOM>let alone subculture.

785
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,400
<26-10,CASTLE>汤姆  你太谦虚了
<26-10,CASTLE>Oh, Tom, you're too modest.

786
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,170
<26-10,CASTLE>很多僵尸都称赞你
<26-10,CASTLE>A number of zombies sang your praises.

787
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,090
<26-11,BECKETT>显然  你就是为僵尸体验提供
<26-11,BECKETT>Yeah, apparently, you're the go-to guy

788
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,250
<26-11,BECKETT>莨菪碱的首选人物
<26-11,BECKETT>for the real zombie experience with the scopolamine.

789
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,700
<26-12,TOM>什么
<26-12,TOM>The what?

790
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,010
<26-13,BECKETT>你在伍德市出生
<26-13,BECKETT>You're a kid from Ridgewood, Tom.

791
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,560
<26-13,BECKETT>你没工作
<26-13,BECKETT>You don't even have a job.

792
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,090
<26-13,BECKETT>但却住在很高档的公寓里
<26-13,BECKETT>And yet, you manage to afford a really nice apartment

793
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,480
<26-13,BECKETT>并有能力支付学费
<26-13,BECKETT>and you're able to pay your tuition.

794
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,750
<26-14,TOM>我申请了学生贷款
<26-14,TOM>I-I took out student loans.

795
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,790
<26-14,TOM>听着
<26-14,TOM>Look...

796
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,310
<26-14,TOM>我真不是毒贩
<26-14,TOM>I'm--I'm--I'm not a drug dealer.

797
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,810
<26-15,CASTLE>你想出人头地
<26-15,CASTLE>You're trying to get ahead.

798
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,050
<26-15,CASTLE>和格蕾塔一起生活
<26-15,CASTLE>You know, make a life with Greta.

799
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,460
<26-15,CASTLE>可她却和某个华尔街的混蛋搭上了
<26-15,CASTLE>And then she steps out with some Wall Street douche

800
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,450
<26-15,CASTLE>那人不肯跟她分手
<26-15,CASTLE>who just would not let her go.

801
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,070
<26-16,BECKETT>大卫在他死的那晚想见见格蕾塔
<26-16,BECKETT>David wanted to see Greta the night that he was killed.

802
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,240
<26-16,BECKETT>可她拒绝了
<26-16,BECKETT>She said no.

803
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,180
<26-16,BECKETT>我们调查了那区
<26-16,BECKETT>We canvassed the area.

804
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,130
<26-16,BECKETT>有人看见他坐在车内  在你家外苦苦守候
<26-16,BECKETT>He was seen sitting in his car outside of your apartment.

805
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,030
<26-17,CASTLE>那晚你离开后
<26-17,CASTLE>When you left that night,

806
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,530
<26-17,CASTLE>他跟踪你到行尸走肉
<26-17,CASTLE>he followed you to the zombie walk.

807
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,420
<26-17,CASTLE>我打赌他跟你说他要争取格蕾塔
<26-17,CASTLE>I'm betting he told you he was gonna fight for Greta.

808
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,300
<26-18,BECKETT>他高富帅
<26-18,BECKETT>He was handsome, he had money,

809
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,750
<26-18,BECKETT>而且两人交往过
<26-18,BECKETT>the two of them had a history.

810
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,970
<26-18,BECKETT>你知道自己不是他对手
<26-18,BECKETT>I mean, you knew you couldn't compete.

811
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,400
<26-19,CASTLE>要是大卫告诉格蕾塔
<26-19,CASTLE>Yeah, especially if David told Greta

812
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,220
<26-19,CASTLE>你不过是个低劣的毒贩  就更没戏了
<26-19,CASTLE>you're nothing but a low-life drug dealer.

813
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,560
<26-19,CASTLE>你只能自己解决麻烦
<26-19,CASTLE>You had to take matters into your own hands.

814
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,100
<26-19,CASTLE>或者更具体  借凯尔的手
<26-19,CASTLE>Or more specifically, Kyle's hands.

815
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,970
<26-20,BECKETT>你想了个妙计
<26-20,BECKETT>So you had this brilliant plan.

816
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,310
<26-20,BECKETT>你给凯尔服用莨菪碱
<26-20,BECKETT>You dosed Kyle with scopolamine,

817
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,690
<26-20,BECKETT>告诉他杀死大卫
<26-20,BECKETT>told him to kill David.

818
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,840
<26-20,BECKETT>这样  人不知鬼不觉
<26-20,BECKETT>Thinking, nobody will ever figure it out.

819
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,570
<26-21,CASTLE>但事实上  最后一点没像计划的那样如意
<26-21,CASTLE>Actually, that last part didn't work out so well.

820
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,190
<26-22,BECKETT>对
<26-22,BECKETT>Yeah.

821
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,540
<26-23,TOM>你们手上
<26-23,TOM>All you have

822
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,530
<26-23,TOM>只有一些精神失常的僵尸的证词
<26-23,TOM>is the word of a few whacked out zombies.

823
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,980
<26-23,TOM>那不足以成为合理依据
<26-23,TOM>That's not even close to probable cause.

824
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,330
<26-24,BECKETT>但足够我扣留你24小时
<26-24,BECKETT>Yeah, well, it's all I need to keep you here for 24 hours.

825
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,580
<26-24,BECKETT>之后
<26-24,BECKETT>And by then,

826
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,260
<26-24,BECKETT>我会找到我要的证据
<26-24,BECKETT>I will have my proof.

827
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,080
<26-25,TOM>不  你不会的
<26-25,TOM>No, you won't.

828
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,360
<27-1,BECKETT>他说得对  我们手上一无所有
<27-1,BECKETT>He's right. We've got nothing.

829
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,830
<27-2,CASTLE>一无所有太绝对了
<27-2,CASTLE>"Nothing" is a strong word.

830
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,450
<27-3,BECKETT>唯一能将汤姆与凶案联系起来的人就是凯尔
<27-3,BECKETT>The only person that can link Tom to the killing is Kyle,

831
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,360
<27-3,BECKETT>可他却什么也记不起来
<27-3,BECKETT>and he doesn't remember anything.

832
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,960
<27-3,BECKETT>而且要命的是
<27-3,BECKETT>And on top of all of that,

833
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,140
<27-3,BECKETT>证据显示是凯尔一人所为
<27-3,BECKETT>the evidence shows that Kyle alone committed the murder.

834
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,320
<27-4,CASTLE>听你这样说
<27-4,CASTLE>Well, when you put it like that...

835
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,590
<27-4,CASTLE>真有些凄凉
<27-4,CASTLE>Yes, it sounds a little bleak.

836
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,610
<27-5,BECKETT>或许就是这样
<27-5,BECKETT>Maybe this is it,

837
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,510
<27-5,BECKETT>每个凶案警察都怕遇见
<27-5,BECKETT>what every homicide cop fears...

838
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,620
<27-6,CASTLE>完美谋杀
<27-6,CASTLE>the perfect murder.

839
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,590
<27-6,CASTLE>这可不是完美谋杀
<27-6,CASTLE>No. This is not the perfect murder.

840
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,760
<27-7,BECKETT>-不可能  -有可能的
<27-7,BECKETT>- Can't be. - It happens.

841
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,700
<27-8,CASTLE>对我来说不可能  除非我写得出来
<27-8,CASTLE>Not to me. Not unless I've written it.

842
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,980
<27-8,CASTLE>我们漏掉些东西了
<27-8,CASTLE>No, we're just missing something.

843
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,810
<27-9,BECKETT>比如证据
<27-9,BECKETT>Like proof.

844
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,940
<27-9,BECKETT>在毫无证据的情况下  我们做了唯一能做的
<27-9,BECKETT>Without it, we did the only thing we could.

845
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,790
<27-9,BECKETT>和汤姆当面对峙  他眼都不眨一下
<27-9,BECKETT>We went at Tom head-on. He didn't blink.

846
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,430
<27-9,BECKETT>我们没辙了
<27-9,BECKETT>We're out of moves.

847
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,240
<27-10,CASTLE>还有一条路
<27-10,CASTLE>We got one move left.

848
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,690
<27-9,BECKETT>我们和汤姆正面交锋过了
<27-9,BECKETT>We went at Tom head-on.

849
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,960
<27-10,CASTLE>现在该暗地里较量了
<27-10,CASTLE>Now we need to go at him sideways.

850
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,390
<27-10,CASTLE>我想好该怎么做了
<27-10,CASTLE>And I know just what to do.

851
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,700
<28-1,BECKETT>格蕾塔  我理解你
<28-1,BECKETT>Greta, I know how you feel.

852
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,770
<28-1,BECKETT>你爱着汤姆
<28-1,BECKETT>You're in love with Tom,

853
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,540
<28-1,BECKETT>所以在你眼中只看得到他的好
<28-1,BECKETT>and you want to see the best in him.

854
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,210
<28-1,BECKETT>但你必须面对现实
<28-1,BECKETT>But you have to look at the facts.

855
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,310
<28-2,GRETA>你说的不是真的
<28-2,GRETA>What you're saying isn't true.

856
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,440
<28-2,GRETA>好吗  都不是真的
<28-2,GRETA>Okay? None of it is.

857
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,120
<28-3,BECKETT>好  那想想钱吧
<28-3,BECKETT>Well, then take the money.

858
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,800
<28-3,BECKETT>他怎么支付得起曼哈顿的公寓
<28-3,BECKETT>How is he able to pay for an apartment in Manhattan?

859
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,850
<28-4,GRETA>我说过很多遍了  不是做毒贩
<28-4,GRETA>Not being a drug dealer, I'll tell you that much.

860
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,860
<28-5,BECKETT>那这枚订婚戒指呢
<28-5,BECKETT>What about that engagement ring?

861
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,130
<28-5,BECKETT>他哪来钱买
<28-5,BECKETT>How can he afford that?

862
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,920
<28-6,GRETA>他说这是他祖母留下的
<28-6,GRETA>He--he said it was his grandmother's.

863
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,980
<28-7,BECKETT>格蕾塔  你是我最后的机会了
<28-7,BECKETT>Greta, you are my last chance.

864
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,190
<28-7,BECKETT>如果你不帮我
<28-7,BECKETT>If you don't help me,

865
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,100
<28-7,BECKETT>一个无辜的人将会因大卫的死
<28-7,BECKETT>an innocent man is gonna go to prison for life

866
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,150
<28-7,BECKETT>被判终身监禁
<28-7,BECKETT>for David's murder.

867
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,780
<28-8,GRETA>不
<28-8,GRETA>No.

868
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,120
<28-8,GRETA>汤姆才是无辜的
<28-8,GRETA>Tom's the innocent one. Okay?

869
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,860
<28-8,GRETA>你已经抓到凶手了  跟我未婚夫无关
<28-8,GRETA>You got your killer, and it's not my fiance.

870
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,340
<29-1,TOM>我还在等你们所谓的证据呢
<29-1,TOM>I'm still waiting on that proof of yours.

871
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,600
<29-1,TOM>还没找到吗
<29-1,TOM>No?

872
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,400
<29-1,TOM>什么都没找到
<29-1,TOM>Nothing?

873
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,310
<29-1,TOM>多谢款待
<29-1,TOM>Well, thanks for the hospitality.

874
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,490
<29-1,TOM>有可以填写的服务
<29-1,TOM>Is there a comment card I could fill out

875
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,440
<29-1,TOM>评价卡吗
<29-1,TOM>about the level of service I received?

876
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,230
<29-2,BECKETT>你可以走了
<29-2,BECKETT>You're free to go.

877
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,170
<29-3,CASTLE>见好就收
<29-3,CASTLE>Take advantage while you can.

878
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,610
<29-4,TOM>格蕾塔告诉我你们的谈话了
<29-4,TOM>Yeah, Greta told me about your little conversation.

879
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,870
<29-4,TOM>那就是你们的把戏吗
<29-4,TOM>That was your big play,

880
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,570
<29-4,TOM>利用我的未婚妻来对付我
<29-4,TOM>to use my own fiancee against me?

881
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,340
<29-5,BECKETT>她迟早会发现你的真面目的
<29-5,BECKETT>She's gonna figure out who you are sooner or later,

882
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,930
<29-5,BECKETT>你将如何应对呢
<29-5,BECKETT>so what are you gonna do about it then?

883
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,310
<29-6,ESPOSITO>凯尔·詹宁斯申请保释
<29-6,ESPOSITO>Kyle Jennings made bail.

884
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,910
<29-6,ESPOSITO>几小时前释放了
<29-6,ESPOSITO>Got released a couple of hours ago.

885
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:48,800
<29-7,TOM>等等  凯尔被放出去了
<29-7,TOM>Wait. Kyle is out?

886
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,230
<29-8,CASTLE>保释金要一百万美金  他哪来这么多钱
<29-8,CASTLE>His bail was set at $1 million. Where'd he get the money?

887
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,350
<29-9,ESPOSITO>他有个很有钱的叔叔
<29-9,ESPOSITO>Turns out he's got an uncle who's got some serious dough.

888
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,020
<29-10,BECKETT>如果我是你  我会避开他
<29-10,BECKETT>I'd steer clear of him if I was you.

889
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,510
<29-11,TOM>你跟他瞎掰了什么谎话
<29-11,TOM>What kind of lies did you tell him?

890
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,310
<29-12,BECKETT>我们什么都没说  但凯尔是个聪明人
<29-12,BECKETT>We didn't tell him anything, but Kyle's a smart guy.

891
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,710
<29-12,BECKETT>他会弄明白的
<29-12,BECKETT>He's gonna do the math.

892
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,560
<29-13,TOM>我要求警方保护
<29-13,TOM>I want police protection.

893
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,110
<29-14,CASTLE>我想你没干啥坏事
<29-14,CASTLE>I thought you didn't do anything wrong.

894
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,200
<29-15,TOM>我是没有  可多亏你们  凯尔以为我干了
<29-15,TOM>I didn't, but thanks to you, Kyle thinks that I did,

895
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,220
<29-15,TOM>现在他又被放出去
<29-15,TOM>and now he's out there.

896
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,570
<29-16,TOM>你们在知道他有可能会袭击我的情况下
<29-16,TOM>Y-you're releasing me with knowledge and forethought

897
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,620
<29-16,TOM>释放我
<29-16,TOM>that he could attack me.

898
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,000
<29-16,TOM>如果他真做了
<29-16,TOM>If he does,

899
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,160
<29-16,TOM>想想我会对你们提起的诉讼
<29-16,TOM>think about the lawsuit I'll file against you.

900
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,320

902
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,370
<29-17,BECKETT>之后你就靠你自己了
<29-17,BECKETT>and then after that, you are on your own.

<30-17,CASTLE>But he, uh...

<30-20,ESPOSITO>别闹了
<30-20,ESPOSITO>Stop it.

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,420
<30-20,ESPOSITO>怪吓人的
<30-20,ESPOSITO>You're creeping me out.

<31-1,CASTLE>你做得太棒了  凯尔
<31-1,CASTLE>Ah, you really nailed it, Kyle.

942
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,090
<31-1,CASTLE>你做的装扮是成功的关键
<31-1,CASTLE>Your costume is what sold that bit.

943
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,380
<31-2,BECKETT>通过帮助我们
<31-2,BECKETT>Yeah, and by helping us,

944
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,770
<31-2,BECKETT>你也帮了自己
<31-2,BECKETT>you've actually helped yourself.

945
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,350
<31-2,BECKETT>有了汤姆的认罪
<31-2,BECKETT>The DA is looking into

946
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,960
<31-2,BECKETT>地检官正在想办法
<31-2,BECKETT>dismissing the charges against you

947
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,270
<31-2,BECKETT>撤销对你的指控
<31-2,BECKETT>now that he has Tom's confession.

948
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,640
<31-3,KYLE>探长  卡塞尔先生
<31-3,KYLE>Detective, Mr. Castle,

949
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,330
<31-3,KYLE>真不知道该怎么感谢你们
<31-3,KYLE>I-I don't know how to thank you--

950
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,150
<31-4,CASTLE>这套僵尸装扮再借我一天
<31-4,CASTLE>Uh, let me borrow the zombie outfit

951
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,930
<31-4,CASTLE>就算感谢我了
<31-4,CASTLE>for another day, we'll call it even.

952
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,580
<31-5,KYLE>你留着吧
<31-5,KYLE>You know what? Keep it.

953
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,030
<31-5,KYLE>我行尸走肉的日子到头了
<31-5,KYLE>My zombie walking days are over.

954
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,660
<31-5,KYLE>我希望忘掉这一切
<31-5,KYLE>I just... want to put all this behind me.

955
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,920
<31-6,CASTLE>一个人怎么能把那种事忘却呢
<31-6,CASTLE>How does somebody put something like that behind them?

956
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,030
<31-6,CASTLE>他需要心理治疗
<31-6,CASTLE>He's gonna need therapy.

957
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,270
<31-7,BECKETT>那有帮助
<31-7,BECKETT>It helps.

958
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,460
<31-7,BECKETT>一开始他根本就无法接受
<31-7,BECKETT>At first he won't even be able to deal with it.

959
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,300
<31-7,BECKETT>即便是抬脚走路
<31-7,BECKETT>It's gonna take everything that he's got

960
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,240
<31-7,BECKETT>撑过一天的生活
<31-7,BECKETT>to just put one foot in front of the other

961
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,230
<31-7,BECKETT>都要耗费他全部的力量
<31-7,BECKETT>and get through the day.

962
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,380
<31-8,CASTLE>我不知道你在看心理医生
<31-8,CASTLE>I didn't know you were seeing a therapist.

963
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,270
<31-9,BECKETT>我不想找借口
<31-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I didn't want to make any excuses.

964
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,190
<31-9,BECKETT>我想花费时间
<31-9,BECKETT>I just wanted to... put in the time

965
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,370
<31-9,BECKETT>作出努力
<31-9,BECKETT>and do the work.

966
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,680
<31-9,BECKETT>但我想我快要找到自己的位置了
<31-9,BECKETT>But I think I'm almost where I want to be now.

967
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,430
<31-10,CASTLE>你的位置在哪儿
<31-10,CASTLE>And... where is that?

968
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,310
<31-11,BECKETT>一个能让我终于承受住那天
<31-11,BECKETT>In a place where I can finally accept

969
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,830
<31-11,BECKETT>发生的一切的地方
<31-11,BECKETT>everything that happened that day.

970
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,040
<31-11,BECKETT>一切
<31-11,BECKETT>Everything.

971
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,440
<31-12,CASTLE>我想
<31-12,CASTLE>I think...

972
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,240
<31-12,CASTLE>我懂
<31-12,CASTLE>I understand.

973
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,120
<31-13,BECKETT>我跟你提到的墙
<31-13,BECKETT>And, um, that wall that I was telling you about...

974
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,600
<31-13,BECKETT>我想它正在倒掉
<31-13,BECKETT>I think it's coming down.

975
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,290
<31-14,CASTLE>倒掉时  我希望能在场
<31-14,CASTLE>Well, I'd like to be there when it does.

976
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,210
<31-15,BECKETT>我也希望你在场
<31-15,BECKETT>Yeah, I'd like you to be there, too.

977
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,160
<31-16,CASTLE>-但是不花僵尸妆  -不知道
<31-16,CASTLE>- Only without the zombie makeup. - I don't know.

978
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,390
<31-17,BECKETT>僵尸妆挺适合你的  卡塞尔
<31-17,BECKETT>I kind of think that the zombie makeup suits you, Castle.

979
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,400
<31-18,CASTLE>那当然  我怎么打扮都帅
<31-18,CASTLE>Yeah, I make it work.

980
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,080
<31-19,BECKETT>明天见
<31-19,BECKETT>Tomorrow?

981
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,210
<31-19,BECKETT>明天见
<31-19,BECKETT>Tomorrow.

982
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,790
<32-1,CASTLE>胜利是我的
<32-1,CASTLE>Victory is mine.

983
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,190
<32-1,CASTLE>1000
<32-1,CASTLE>1,000...

984
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,850
<32-1,CASTLE>分
<32-1,CASTLE>points.

985
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,950
<32-1,CASTLE>今天我行大运
<32-1,CASTLE>And that is the icing

986
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,390
<32-1,CASTLE>这不过是锦上添花
<32-1,CASTLE>on the cake that has been my day.

987
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,870
<32-2,ALEXIS>这就完了
<32-2,ALEXIS>That's it?

988
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,030
<32-2,ALEXIS>都结束了
<32-2,ALEXIS>It's over?

989
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,150
<32-3,CASTLE>什么  阿丽克西斯
<32-3,CASTLE>What? Come on, Alexis.

990
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,120
<32-3,CASTLE>这只是游戏
<32-3,CASTLE>It's just a game.

991
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,370
<32-4,ALEXIS>从我五岁开始的游戏
<32-4,ALEXIS>A game we started when I was 5,

992
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,040
<32-14,CASTLE>现在结束了
<32-14,CASTLE>and it's over.

993
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,330
<32-4,ALEXIS>我会毕业  上大学
<32-4,ALEXIS>And I'm going to graduate, leave for college,

994
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,290
<32-4,ALEXIS>我们分隔两地
<32-4,ALEXIS>and I'll be there and you'll be here,

995
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,550
<32-4,ALEXIS>我们只能在圣诞节和暑假玩
<32-4,ALEXIS>and we can play at Christmas and during the summer,

996
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,950
<32-4,ALEXIS>但是跟以前不一样了  对吧
<32-4,ALEXIS>but... It won't be the same, will it?

997
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:48,960
<32-4,ALEXIS>是的
<32-4,ALEXIS>No.

998
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,940
<32-5,CASTLE>但是事情总会改变的
<32-5,CASTLE>But you know what? Things change.

999
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,790
<32-5,CASTLE>改变是好事
<32-5,CASTLE>And change is good.

1000
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,200
<32-6,ALEXIS>我做不到
<32-6,ALEXIS>I can't do it.

1001
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,350
<32-7,CASTLE>做什么
<32-7,CASTLE>Do what?

1002
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,730
<32-8,ALEXIS>去那么远的地方
<32-8,ALEXIS>Go that far away.

1003
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,320
<32-8,ALEXIS>我想那样做  可是不能那么远
<32-8,ALEXIS>I want to go away, but not that far.

1004
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,720
<32-8,ALEXIS>我为此恨自己  因为我的座右铭是
<32-8,ALEXIS>And I hate myself for it, because my personal motto is,

1005
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,770
<32-8,ALEXIS>做自己最害怕的事
<32-8,ALEXIS>"Do the thing that you fear the most,"

1006
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,000
<32-8,ALEXIS>但是每次我要点申请牛津或是斯坦福
<32-8,ALEXIS>but every time I get ready to hit the send button

1007
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,300
<32-8,ALEXIS>确认邮件的发送键时
<32-8,ALEXIS>on my acceptance to oxford or stanford, I...

1008
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,860
<32-8,ALEXIS>我就浑身难受
<32-8,ALEXIS>I get all sick inside.

1009
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,690
<32-9,CASTLE>你要追随内心的想法
<32-9,CASTLE>Well, you... Follow your heart.

1010
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,220
<32-9,CASTLE>那样永远不会错
<32-9,CASTLE>Follow your heart, you can't go wrong.

1011
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,140
<32-10,ALEXIS>我心里的想法是
<32-10,ALEXIS>And my heart is telling me...

1012
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,280
<32-10,ALEXIS>去哥伦比亚大学
<32-10,ALEXIS>go to Columbia.

1013
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,630
<32-11,ALEXIS>但是还有个问题  如果我去哥伦比亚
<32-11,ALEXIS>But here's the other thing-- if I do this,

1014
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,000
<32-11,ALEXIS>你得保证别总来找我
<32-11,ALEXIS>you have to promise not to drop in on me.

1015
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,020
<32-11,ALEXIS>如果我去哥伦比亚
<32-11,ALEXIS>If I do this,

1016
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,540
<32-11,ALEXIS>你得给我空间
<32-11,ALEXIS>you have to give me my space.

1017
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,570
<32-11,ALEXIS>你能做到吗
<32-11,ALEXIS>Do you think you can do that?

1018
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,590
<32-12,CASTLE>我想我可以郑重发誓我会
<32-12,CASTLE>I think I can give a sincere and solemn oath

1019
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,880
<32-12,CASTLE>努力的
<32-12,CASTLE>to try.

1020
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,300
<32-13,ALEXIS>那就
<32-13,ALEXIS>Then...

1021
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,320
<32-13,ALEXIS>三局两胜吧
<32-13,ALEXIS>best two out of three.

1022
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,160
<32-14,CASTLE>我跟你没完
<32-14,CASTLE>This isn't over.

1023
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:03,930
<32-14,CASTLE>我跟你没完
<32-14,CASTLE>This isn't over.
