34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,850
<3-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我最后一招瑜伽"挺尸式"都被你毁了

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,140
<3-2,MARTHA RODGERS>如果你在进行方法派创作
<3-2,MARTHA RODGERS>If you are method writing

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,860
<3-2,MARTHA RODGERS>扮演你笔下凶案的被害人
<3-2,MARTHA RODGERS>and playing the role of your murder victim,

<3-3,CASTLE>No, mother, I didn't--

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,590
<3-3,CASTLE>我只是  我刚才
<3-3,CASTLE>I just--I was...

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,190
<3-3,CASTLE>我在谷歌我自己
<3-3,CASTLE>I was googling... myself

42
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,590
<3-3,CASTLE>我发现了这个
<3-3,CASTLE>and I found this.

43
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,800
<3-4,MARTHA>我不知道阿丽克西斯有自己的网站
<3-4,MARTHA>Oh, I didn't know Alexis had a web site.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,020
<3-5,CASTLE>我也不知道
<3-5,CASTLE>Neither did I.

45
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,520
<3-5,CASTLE>这是个视博  视频博客
<3-5,CASTLE>It's a vlog. It's a video blog.

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,800
<3-6,MARTHA>好吧  很好啊
<3-6,MARTHA>Oh, well, that's charming.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,430
<3-7,CASTLE>不  这不好
<3-7,CASTLE>No. No, it is not charming.

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,370
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>今晚我和麦克斯去洛克菲勒中心溜冰
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>So tonight Max and I went ice skating

49
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,430
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>又一次
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>at Rockefeller Center again.

50
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,510
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>当然  我又一次假装溜得不稳
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>And, yes, I pretended to be unsteady on my skates again.

51
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,120
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>当然  麦克斯在我又一次要摔倒时抱住了我
<3-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>And, yes, Max caught me as I "fell" again.

52
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,370
<3-9,MARTHA>真是太可爱了
<3-9,MARTHA>That is completely adorable,

53
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,550
<3-9,MARTHA>她好上镜
<3-9,MARTHA>and the camera just loves her.

54
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,920
<3-9,MARTHA>当然了  那是我的基因
<3-9,MARTHA>Of course, she gets that from me.

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,450
<3-10,CASTLE>妈  阿丽克西斯对着全世界
<3-10,CASTLE>Mother, Alexis is sharing,

56
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,360
<3-10,CASTLE>分享她的私生活
<3-10,CASTLE>with the whole world,

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,940
<3-10,CASTLE>听好了  是她个人的
<3-10,CASTLE>Mind you, personal,

58
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,570
<3-10,CASTLE>她生活的私密细节
<3-10,CASTLE>intimate details about her life--

59
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,710
<3-10,CASTLE>她去了哪里  和谁一起去
<3-10,CASTLE>Where she goes, who she goes with.

60
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,800
<3-10,CASTLE>这可不安全
<3-10,CASTLE>This is not safe.

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,690
<3-11,MARTHA>亲爱的  你什么时候变得如此唠叨守旧了
<3-11,MARTHA>Darling, when did you get to be such a fuddy-duddy?

62
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,330
<3-11,MARTHA>相信我  你年轻的时候要糟得多
<3-11,MARTHA>Believe me, you were far worse in your day.

63
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,940
<3-12,CASTLE>我年轻的时候不是现在
<3-12,CASTLE>My day is not today.

64
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,880
<3-12,CASTLE>当时可不是现在
<3-12,CASTLE>That day is not today.

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,070
<3-12,CASTLE>现在流行网络跟踪狂
<3-12,CASTLE>Today is the day of the internet stalker.

66
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,350
<3-12,CASTLE>现在流行...
<3-12,CASTLE>Today is the day for--

67
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,040
<3-13,MARTHA>亲爱的  你还是接电话吧
<3-13,MARTHA>Darling, why don't you just answer your phone?

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,310
<3-13,MARTHA>瞧  贝克特打来的
<3-13,MARTHA>Oh, and it's Beckett.

69
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,280
<3-13,MARTHA>也许她有个不错的谋杀案可以把你
<3-13,MARTHA>Maybe she has a nice murder to distract you

70
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,260
<3-13,MARTHA>从父亲偏执狂中解救出来
<3-13,MARTHA>from your parental paranoia.

71
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,650
<3-14,CASTLE>有礼了
<3-14,CASTLE>Namaste.

72
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,770
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>她有个视频博客  那又怎样  卡塞尔
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>So she video blogs, Castle. So what?

73
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,560
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>她这个年纪的人大多都有
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>Plenty of people do her age.

74
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,660
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>怎么了  她上传了不雅视频吗
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>Why? Did she post something inappropriate?

75
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,370
<4-2,CASTLE>不  但重点不是这个
<4-2,CASTLE>No, but that's not the point.

76
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,450
<4-3,BECKETT>那重点是什么
<4-3,BECKETT>Well, what is the point?

77
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,790
<4-4,CASTLE>重点是  她分享过度了
<4-4,CASTLE>The point is, she's oversharing.

78
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,390
<4-4,CASTLE>她没有意识到  一旦传上互联网
<4-4,CASTLE>She doesn't realize, whatever she posts on the internet

79
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,450
<4-4,CASTLE>就永远公之于众了
<4-4,CASTLE>is out there forever.

80
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,580
<4-5,BECKETT>至少你可以感到高兴  阿丽克西斯没有
<4-5,BECKETT>Well, at least be happy that Alexis isn't posting

81
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,770
<4-6,CASTLE>-上传这样的东西  -《疯狂女大学生》
<4-6,CASTLE>- something like that. - "College Girls Gone Crazy"?

82
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,210
<4-7,BECKETT>对  打造出这个的是过度分享高手
<4-7,BECKETT>Yeah, brought to you by the master of oversharing,

83
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,290
<4-7,BECKETT>博阿·兰道夫先生
<4-7,BECKETT>Mr. Beau Randolph.

84
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,650
<4-7,BECKETT>她...
<4-7,BECKETT>She...

85
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,690
<5-1,BECKETT>想看就看吧  卡塞尔
<5-1,BECKETT>It's all right to look, Castle.

86
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,900
<5-2,CASTLE>看什么
<5-2,CASTLE>Look at what?

87
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,180
<5-2,CASTLE>看起来博阿·兰道夫的世界
<5-2,CASTLE>So it doesn't seem as though Beau Randolph's world

88
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,680
<5-2,CASTLE>在我们向他调查冰冻头案件后
<5-2,CASTLE>has changed very much since we interviewed him

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,030
<5-2,CASTLE>没什么改变嘛
<5-2,CASTLE>for that frozen head case.

90
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,920
<5-3,BECKETT>除了他不再置身其中
<5-3,BECKETT>Except that he's no longer in it.

91
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,570
<5-4,CASTLE>博阿·兰道夫是被害人吗
<5-4,CASTLE>Beau Randolph is our victim?

92
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,700
<6-1,CASTLE>他是在女卫生间遇害的吗
<6-1,CASTLE>He was murdered in the women's bathroom?

93
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,850
<6-1,CASTLE>"疯狂女大学生"又有新含义
<6-1,CASTLE>Brings new meaning to "College Girls Gone Crazy."

94
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,790
<6-2,LANIE PARISH>看来是的
<6-2,LANIE PARISH>Looks that way.

95
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,510
<6-2,LANIE PARISH>他的尸体是在一个厕所隔间被发现的
<6-2,LANIE PARISH>His body was found in one of the stalls.

96
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,200
<6-2,LANIE PARISH>是被勒死的
<6-2,LANIE PARISH>Cause of death is strangulation.

97
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,590
<6-3,BECKETT>徒手还是绳带类
<6-3,BECKETT>Manual or ligature?

98
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,640
<6-3,BECKETT>绳带类
<6-3,BECKETT>Ligature.

99
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,630
<6-4,LANIE>看他脖子上的勒痕
<6-4,LANIE>Look at these bruises on his neck.

100
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,420
<6-4,LANIE>是胸罩上的扣环印
<6-4,LANIE>It's from a clasp on a bra.

101
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,870
<6-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>凶器就被扔在他身旁
<6-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>The murder weapon was found lying next to him.

102
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,740
<6-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我猜是一个女生将他引诱到这里幽会
<6-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I figure that a chick lured him in here for a little tryst

103
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,940
<6-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>然后勒死了他
<6-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>and then choked him out.

104
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,830
<6-6,BECKETT>死亡时间
<6-6,BECKETT>Time of death?

105
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,860
<6-7,ESPOSITO>11点50分左右  他还在跟酒保说话
<6-7,ESPOSITO>Well, he was talking to the bartender around 11:50,

106
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,560
<6-7,ESPOSITO>11点58分尸体在隔间里被发现
<6-7,ESPOSITO>and the body was found in the stall at 11:58 p.m.

107
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,370
<6-8,BECKETT>蕾妮  你认为我们
<6-8,BECKETT>Lanie, do you think that

108
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,280
<6-8,BECKETT>能在凶器上获得DNA吗
<6-8,BECKETT>we can get D.N.A. off of the murder weapon?

109
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,600
<6-9,LANIE>我已经采集了样本  但是看看这个
<6-9,LANIE>I already collected samples, but check this out.

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,660
<6-9,LANIE>这可是36D的苏特拉
<6-9,LANIE>This is a 36D Sultura.

111
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,540
<6-10,BECKETT>高级货啊
<6-10,BECKETT>Oh, that's high-end.

112
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,080
<6-11,LANIE>绝对的  一个要花上两百到两百五十块
<6-11,LANIE>Definitely. One of these could run you $200, $250.

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,170
<6-12,ESPOSITO>两百五十美元买一个胸罩
<6-12,ESPOSITO>$250 for a bra?

114
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,710
<6-13,LANIE>这钱花在运动鞋上就没问题了吧
<6-13,LANIE>Oh, but it's okay to spend that on a pair of sneakers, right?

115
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,530
<6-14,ESPOSITO>运动鞋是很有实用性的
<6-14,ESPOSITO>A pair of sneakers is practical.

116
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,740
<6-14,ESPOSITO>明白吗  它们可以给予你...
<6-14,ESPOSITO>Okay? They can support your, um...

117
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,840
<6-15,CASTLE>驱逐出场
<6-15,CASTLE>Eject.

118
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,390
<6-16,BECKETT>出售这种胸罩的商店不会太多
<6-16,BECKETT>The list of shops that sell that can't be that long

119
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,460
<6-16,BECKETT>你去查查购买人是谁
<6-16,BECKETT>so see if you can figure out who purchased it.

120
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,770
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>看来俱乐部的确有今晚的宾客名单
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>Hey, so looks like there was a guest list at the club tonight.

121
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,810
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>但如果你是一个兜里有20块钱的男人
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>But if you were a guy with 20 bucks in your pocket

122
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,660
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>出现在俱乐部门口
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>and you showed up at the door,

123
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,300
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>或是一位美女  都能进来
<6-17,KEVIN RYAN>Or a pretty girl, you got in.

124
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,530
<6-18,BECKETT>证人呢  有谁看到博阿和谁在一起吗
<6-18,BECKETT>What about witnesses? Anyone see who Beau was with?

125
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,280
<6-19,ESPOSITO>还没问到  不过警员已经带这里的人
<6-19,ESPOSITO>Not yet, but uniforms are taking witness statements

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
<6-19,ESPOSITO>回警局录口供了
<6-19,ESPOSITO>from people here and down at the precinct.

127
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
<6-20,CASTLE>他们今晚为网站拍摄视频
<6-20,CASTLE>They were shooting for the web site tonight,

128
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,620
<6-20,CASTLE>如果没有人看到博阿
<6-20,CASTLE>so even if no one saw Beau,

129
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,090
<6-20,CASTLE>也许有摄像机拍到他
<6-20,CASTLE>chances are someone caught him on video.

130
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,490
<6-21,BECKETT>谁负责拍摄
<6-21,BECKETT>Who was in charge of taping?

131
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,660
<6-22,RYAN>制片人名叫特洛伊·斯特里兰德
<6-22,RYAN>The video's producer, a guy named Troy Strickland.

132
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,720
<6-22,RYAN>但更大的问题是  凶手是怎么
<6-22,RYAN>But the bigger question is how anyone got to Beau

133
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,670
<6-22,RYAN>接近博阿的
<6-22,RYAN>in the first place.

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,230
<6-22,RYAN>据俱乐部保安说  他今晚带了个保镖
<6-22,RYAN>According to club security, he came with a bodyguard tonight.

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,110
<6-23,ESPOSITO>还真管用啊
<6-23,ESPOSITO>Well, that worked out, didn't it?

136
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,900
<6-24,BECKETT>埃斯波  你和莱恩去找保镖
<6-24,BECKETT>Okay, Espo, you and Ryan take the bodyguard.

137
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,140
<6-24,BECKETT>卡塞尔和我去跟制片人谈谈
<6-24,BECKETT>Castle and I will talk to the producer.

138
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,410
<7-1,ESPOSITO>世界上最差的保镖呢
<7-1,ESPOSITO>So where's the world's worst bodyguard?

139
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,390
<7-2,RYAN>告诉保安通知他在警戒线这和我们会面
<7-2,RYAN>Told security to have him meet us near the rope line.

140
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,510
<7-2,RYAN>他叫琼斯
<7-2,RYAN>His name is Jones.

141
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,790
<7-3,ESPOSITO>这人吗
<7-3,ESPOSITO>This guy?

142
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,000
<7-4,ESPOSITO>你是琼斯吗
<7-4,ESPOSITO>You Jones?

143
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,840
<7-5,SCARLETT JONES>我是琼斯  斯嘉丽·琼斯
<7-5,SCARLETT JONES>I'm Jones. Scarlet Jones.

144
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,670
<7-6,RYAN>纽约警局的莱恩和埃斯波西托警探
<7-6,RYAN>Detectives Ryan and Esposito. NYPD.

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,520
<7-7,ESPOSITO>你本该看着博阿的
<7-7,ESPOSITO>You were supposed to have eyes on Beau.

146
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,520
<7-7,ESPOSITO>怎么回事
<7-7,ESPOSITO>So what happened?

147
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,270
<7-8,SCARLETT>博阿告诉我在车附近等着
<7-8,SCARLETT>Beau told me to wait outside with the car.

148
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,690
<7-8,SCARLETT>老板吩咐了  你就得照办
<7-8,SCARLETT>When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it.

149
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,540
<7-8,SCARLETT>但的确古怪
<7-8,SCARLETT>But it was weird.

150
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,600
<7-8,SCARLETT>他今晚好像不想让我进去
<7-8,SCARLETT>Like he didn't want me in there tonight.

151
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,560
<7-9,ESPOSITO>他进俱乐部后你就没见过他了吗
<7-9,ESPOSITO>So you never saw him again after he went in the club?

152
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,300
<7-10,SCARLETT>是的
<7-10,SCARLETT>I'm afraid not.

153
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,930
<7-11,RYAN>今晚你有看见可疑人员吗
<7-11,RYAN>Did you see anyone else that seemed suspicious tonight?

154
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,710
<7-12,SCARLETT>我做了威胁评估
<7-12,SCARLETT>Look, I did my threat assessment, okay?

155
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,170
<7-12,SCARLETT>唯一的威胁是...
<7-12,SCARLETT>The only one was, uh...

156
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,560
<7-13,ESPOSITO>什么
<7-13,ESPOSITO>What?

157
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,800
<7-14,SCARLETT>蒂芙尼  蒂芙尼·肖
<7-14,SCARLETT>Tiffany. Tiffany Shaw.

158
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,610
<7-15,ESPOSITO>是那个女演员吧
<7-15,ESPOSITO>Hey, that's that actress. Right?

159
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,280
<7-15,ESPOSITO>她拍三级片...我是听说的
<7-15,ESPOSITO>She does soft-core, cable type of... so I've heard.

160
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
<7-15,ESPOSITO>她也是博阿的前女友
<7-15,ESPOSITO>That's also Beau's ex-girlfriend.

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,190
<7-16,SCARLETT>两个月前  他想甩了她
<7-16,SCARLETT>He tried to dump her two months ago,

162
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,720
<7-16,SCARLETT>但是她不同意
<7-16,SCARLETT>but she wouldn't take no for an answer.

163
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,650
<7-16,SCARLETT>他申请了禁令
<7-16,SCARLETT>He got a restraining order against her,

164
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,920
<7-16,SCARLETT>但那还是没法甩掉她
<7-16,SCARLETT>and that still didn't keep her away.

165
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,340
<7-17,RYAN>她今晚也在这里吗
<7-17,RYAN>And she was here tonight?

166
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,490
<7-18,SCARLETT>她想进入俱乐部
<7-18,SCARLETT>She tried to get into the club,

167
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,090
<7-18,SCARLETT>我在门口拦住了她
<7-18,SCARLETT>and I stopped her at the rope line.

168
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,700
<7-18,SCARLETT>我告诉她  如果她不走
<7-18,SCARLETT>I told her I would call the police

169
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,440
<7-18,SCARLETT>我就叫警察  然后她就走了
<7-18,SCARLETT>if she didn't walk away, so she did.

170
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,140
<7-19,ESPOSITO>她可能回来吗
<7-19,ESPOSITO>Any chance she came back?

171
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,400
<7-20,SCARLETT>我没看到
<7-20,SCARLETT>Not through me.

172
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,000
<7-20,SCARLETT>但是我守不住每扇门
<7-20,SCARLETT>But I couldn't cover every door.

173
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,840
<8-1,TROY>我认识蒂芙尼很久了
<8-1,TROY>Yeah, I've known Tiffany for a long time.

174
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,180
<8-1,TROY>她是个疯女人
<8-1,TROY>She's a crazy chick,

175
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,840
<8-1,TROY>而且深深爱上了博阿
<8-1,TROY>and definitely obsessed with Beau.

176
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,660
<8-1,TROY>但我今晚没在俱乐部见到她
<8-1,TROY>But I didn't see her in the club tonight.

177
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,270
<8-2,CASTLE>你注意到什么了吗  任何情况
<8-2,CASTLE>What did you see, if anything?

178
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,120
<8-3,TROY>只是漂亮姑娘  还有美式享乐
<8-3,TROY>Uh, just pretty girls and good, clean, all-American fun.

179
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,280
<8-3,TROY>天啊  真是受不了
<8-3,TROY>Man, this sucks.

180
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,550
<8-3,TROY>从一开始  我就和博阿合作
<8-3,TROY>I've been with Beau since the beginning.

181
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,070
<8-3,TROY>我是他的第一摄影师
<8-3,TROY>I was his first cameraman,

182
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,680
<8-3,TROY>第一制片人
<8-3,TROY>first producer.

183
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,060
<8-3,TROY>我们都不知道自己在做什么
<8-3,TROY>We barely knew what we were doing.

184
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,700
<8-4,BECKETT>他有家人吗
<8-4,BECKETT>Did he have any family?

185
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,220
<8-5,TROY>没有  他很小的时候妈妈就走了
<8-5,TROY>No, his mom left when he was little.

186
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,500
<8-5,TROY>他不知道爸爸是谁
<8-5,TROY>He never knew his dad.

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,690
<8-5,TROY>我觉得这是他的动力
<8-5,TROY>I think it's what drove him.

188
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,260
<8-5,TROY>这家公司就是他未曾有过的家庭
<8-5,TROY>You know, this company was the family he never had.

189
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,310
<8-5,TROY>人们觉得他是花花公子
<8-5,TROY>People thought he was this sleaze,

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,020
<8-5,TROY>身边总有一群女人
<8-5,TROY>surrounding himself with all these women,

191
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,020
<8-5,TROY>但这是因为他在寻找不曾拥有的温暖
<8-5,TROY>but it's because he was looking for something he couldn't find.

192
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,020
<8-6,BECKETT>特洛伊  我们得看看
<8-6,BECKETT>Troy, we're gonna need to see

206

232
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,350
<9-6,RYAN>他转过头
<9-6,RYAN>He--he turns his head

233
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,540
<9-6,RYAN>好像看到了什么
<9-6,RYAN>like he sees something

234
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,990
<9-6,RYAN>或是什么人

236
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,940
<9-7,ESPOSITO>正是谋杀发生之前
<9-7,ESPOSITO>That's right around the time of the murder.

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
<9-7,ESPOSITO>看
<9-7,ESPOSITO>Look.

<9-8,RYAN>He walks right by those women. They're watching him go.

239
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,320
<9-9,ESPOSITO>等等
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute.

240
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,880
<9-9,ESPOSITO>穿粉色的女孩
<9-9,ESPOSITO>The girl in pink...

241
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,900
<9-9,ESPOSITO>她来了  她看见博阿去了哪里
<9-9,ESPOSITO>She's here. She saw where Beau went.

242
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,070
<9-9,ESPOSITO>那是我
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, that's me.

243
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,350
<10-1,CANDICE>我本来不想去
<10-1,CANDICE>I-I didn't want to go,

244
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,310
<10-1,CANDICE>但是一个女友非得拉着我
<10-1,CANDICE>but one of my girlfriends dragged me out.

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,400
<10-1,CANDICE>现在我身陷谋杀案当中
<10-1,CANDICE>Now I'm stuck in the middle of all this.

246
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,680
<10-2,ESPOSITO>总比被谋杀的好
<10-2,ESPOSITO>Better than in the middle.

247
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,800
<10-2,ESPOSITO>在他被害之前  你看到他去了哪里
<10-2,ESPOSITO>You saw where he went just before he was murdered.

248
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,500
<10-2,ESPOSITO>你可能是最后一个看见他还活着的人
<10-2,ESPOSITO>You might have been the last person to see him alive.

249
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,630
<10-3,RYAN>梅菲尔德女士  他从你身边经过时
<10-3,RYAN>Ms. Mayfield, when he walked by you,

250
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,000
<10-3,RYAN>你看见他要去哪里或者在干什么吗
<10-3,RYAN>Did you see where he was going or what he was doing?

251
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,220
<10-4,CANDICE>灯光晃眼  很难看清
<10-4,CANDICE>The lights were flashing. It was pretty hard to see.

252
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,370
<10-4,CANDICE>对不起  我以前从没见过他
<10-4,CANDICE>I'm sorry. I've never even seen the guy before.

253
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,060
<11-1,CASTLE>这里平时有保安值班吗
<11-1,CASTLE>Is there usually a guard on duty?

254
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,730
<11-2,GARY>有  他六点下班
<11-2,GARY>Well, yeah, he-- he leaves at 6:00,

255
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,420
<11-2,GARY>但我们仍能用他的工作站
<11-2,GARY>but we can still access our database

256
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,030
<11-2,GARY>登陆数据库
<11-2,GARY>from his workstation here.

257
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,510
<11-3,BECKETT>重点看过去六个月
<11-3,BECKETT>Okay, I'd like to focus on all of the threats

258
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,150
<11-3,BECKETT>有没有什么威胁
<11-3,BECKETT>from the last six months or so.

259
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,670
<11-3,BECKETT>这是登陆日志吗
<11-3,BECKETT>Is this an entry log?

260
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,060
<11-4,GARY>是的  怎么了
<11-4,GARY>Uh, yes. Why?

261
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,080
<11-5,BECKETT>这里显示博阿·兰道夫
<11-5,BECKETT>It says that Beau Randolph

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,830
<11-5,BECKETT>凌晨12点09分扫过出入证
<11-5,BECKETT>swiped his key card at 12:09 a.m.

263
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,360
<11-6,CASTLE>不可能啊  他那时早已经死了
<11-6,CASTLE>That's impossible. He was already dead.

264
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,790
<11-7,BECKETT>凶手偷了出入证
<11-7,BECKETT>Our killer stole the card

265
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,900
<11-7,BECKETT>进入这栋大楼
<11-7,BECKETT>and then gained entry into this building.

266
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,890
<11-7,BECKETT>为了什么
<11-7,BECKETT>What were they after?

267
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,790
<11-8,GARY>根据日志来看
<11-8,GARY>According to this,

268
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,140
<11-8,GARY>用这张出入证的人进了博阿的办公室
<11-8,GARY>whoever used that key card went into Beau's office.

269
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,110
<11-9,BECKETT>办公室里有摄像头吗
<11-9,BECKETT>Are there security cameras in there?

270
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,910
<11-10,GARY>正在调监控录像出来
<11-10,GARY>Pulling it up now.

271
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
<11-11,GARY>是冲着保险箱去的
<11-11,GARY>He's going for the safe.

272
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,940
<11-11,GARY>博阿刚装上
<11-11,GARY>Beau just had that installed.

273
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,900
<11-12,CASTLE>里面都放了些什么
<11-12,CASTLE>What does he keep in there?

274
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,550
<11-12,CASTLE>不清楚
<11-12,CASTLE>I don't know,

275
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,120
<11-13,GARY>但一提到那个保险箱  他就
<11-13,GARY>but when it came to that safe, he was...

276
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,710
<11-13,GARY>神经兮兮的
<11-13,GARY>pretty paranoid.

277
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,620
<11-14,CASTLE>是张记忆卡
<11-14,CASTLE>That's an S.D. card.

278
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,470
<11-15,BECKETT>快回头
<11-15,BECKETT>Come on. Turn around.

279
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,720
<11-16,GARY>天呐
<11-16,GARY>Oh, my God.

280
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,140
<11-17,BECKETT>是博阿·兰道夫的保镖
<11-17,BECKETT>That's Beau Randolph's bodyguard.

281
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,280
<11-18,CASTLE>她做事可真不靠谱啊
<11-18,CASTLE>Well, she's not very good at her job.

291
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,010
<12-1,RYAN>好消息是
<12-1,RYAN>Good news is,

292
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,730
<12-1,RYAN>斯嘉丽·琼斯不是世上最烂的保镖
<12-1,RYAN>Scarlet Jones is not the world's worst bodyguard.

293
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,980
<12-1,RYAN>坏消息是  她是杀人凶手
<12-1,RYAN>Bad news is, she's a murderer.

294
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,200
<12-2,ESPOSITO>这么性感的人锒铛入狱
<12-2,ESPOSITO>Someone that sexy going to prison?

295
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,030
<12-2,ESPOSITO>这本身就是种犯罪
<12-2,ESPOSITO>That in itself is a crime.

296
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,180
<12-2,ESPOSITO>有必要吗
<12-2,ESPOSITO>Is this really necessary?

297
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,970
<13-1,SCARLETT>我已经对你们的警探知无不言了
<13-1,SCARLETT>I told your detectives everything I know.

298
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,970
<13-1,SCARLETT>未必吧
<13-1,SCARLETT>Not everything.

299
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,780
<13-2,BECKETT>比如说  你没告诉我们
<13-2,BECKETT>For instance, you didn't tell us

300
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,560
<13-2,BECKETT>你才为兰道夫先生工作了
<13-2,BECKETT>that you had been working for Mr. Randolph

301
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,980
<13-2,BECKETT>几周时间而已
<13-2,BECKETT>for only a couple of weeks.

302
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,420
<13-3,SCARLETT>有什么关系
<13-3,SCARLETT>How is that relevant?

303
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,190
<13-4,CASTLE>你的口供里提到
<13-4,CASTLE>Well, in your statement, you said that

304
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,990
<13-4,CASTLE>博阿进俱乐部时  你在车里等他
<13-4,CASTLE>when Beau went into the club, you stayed with the limo.

305
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,720
<13-5,SCARLETT>是的  没错
<13-5,SCARLETT>That's right. That's what I did.

306
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,710
<13-6,BECKETT>那也许你能解释一下这个
<13-6,BECKETT>So then maybe you can explain this.

307
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,410
<13-6,BECKETT>照片里貌似是你在偷记忆卡
<13-6,BECKETT>That appears to be you stealing an S.D. card.

308
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,580
<13-7,CASTLE>在你说"邪恶双胞胎姐妹"之前  要知道
<13-7,CASTLE>And before you say "evil twin", just know--

309
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,030
<13-7,CASTLE>那借口太老套了
<13-7,CASTLE>it's been done.

310
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,080
<13-8,BECKETT>他刚死你就用他的出入证
<13-8,BECKETT>You broke in to his office just after he died

311
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,640
<13-8,BECKETT>闯进了他的办公室
<13-8,BECKETT>using his key card.

312
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,580
<13-8,BECKETT>你怎么拿到出入证的
<13-8,BECKETT>How did you get it?

313
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,120
<13-9,SCARLETT>我没杀博阿
<13-9,SCARLETT>Look, I didn't kill Beau,

314
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,790
<13-9,SCARLETT>更不是为了他的出入证
<13-9,SCARLETT>and certainly not for his key card.

315
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,490
<13-9,SCARLETT>他落在车里了  我知道这是我唯一的机会
<13-9,SCARLETT>He left it in the limo. I knew it was my only chance.

316
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,850
<13-10,BECKETT>什么叫唯一的机会
<13-10,BECKETT>What do you mean, only chance?

317
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,150
<13-11,SCARLETT>有段性爱录像
<13-11,SCARLETT>There was this... sex tape.

318
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,350
<13-11,SCARLETT>我朋友犯了个错  跟博阿上了床
<13-11,SCARLETT>This friend of mine made the mistake of sleeping with Beau,

319
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
<13-11,SCARLETT>他把过程录了下来
<13-11,SCARLETT>and he videotaped it.

320
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,280
<13-11,SCARLETT>她知道要是泄露出去
<13-11,SCARLETT>She knew that if it ever got out,

321
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,330
<13-11,SCARLETT>她一生就毁了
<13-11,SCARLETT>it would destroy her life,

322
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,900
<13-11,SCARLETT>于是我做他保镖  保证录像不会泄露
<13-11,SCARLETT>so I took this job to make sure the tape never got out.

323
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,860
<13-8,BECKETT>博阿叫我待在车里时
<13-8,BECKETT>When Beau told me to stay with the car,

324
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,230
<13-9,SCARLETT>我知道这是我唯一的机会
<13-9,SCARLETT>I knew it was my only shot,

325
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,560
<13-11,SCARLETT>所以我闯入了他的办公室
<13-11,SCARLETT>so, yes, I-I broke in to his office,

326
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,730
<13-11,SCARLETT>我把记忆卡偷走毁掉了
<13-11,SCARLETT>I took the S.D. card, and I destroyed it.

327
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,020
<13-11,SCARLETT>但仅此而已
<13-11,SCARLETT>But that's all I did.

328
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,570
<13-12,BECKETT>你朋友叫什么
<13-12,BECKETT>And who is this friend of yours?

329
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,080
<13-13,SCARLETT>明蒂·诺顿
<13-13,SCARLETT>Her name is Mindy Norton.

330
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,290
<13-13,SCARLETT>正如我跟那两位警探说的  凶手一定是蒂芙尼
<13-13,SCARLETT>Like I told your detectives, the killer must be Tiffany.

331
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,570
<13-13,SCARLETT>她恨博阿跟她分手
<13-13,SCARLETT>She hated Beau for breaking up with her.

332
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,110
<13-13,SCARLETT>她一定是趁我不在
<13-13,SCARLETT>Look, she-- she must have snuck back into the club

333
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,970
<13-13,SCARLETT>偷偷溜回了俱乐部
<13-13,SCARLETT>while I was gone.

334
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,230
<13-14,CASTLE>我们看过监控录像
<13-14,CASTLE>We reviewed the video footage.

335
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,980
<13-14,CASTLE>没有证据显示蒂芙尼当晚在夜店
<13-14,CASTLE>There's no evidence Tiffany was at the club.

336
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,760
<13-15,BECKETT>事实上  所有证据都指向你
<13-15,BECKETT>In fact, all of the evidence points to you.

337
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,180
<13-15,BECKETT>博阿是11点50分之后死的
<13-15,BECKETT>Beau died after 11:50.

338
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,630
<13-15,BECKETT>这点时间足够让你杀了他
<13-15,BECKETT>That gave you enough time to kill him,

339
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,580
<13-15,BECKETT>偷走记忆卡  再回到俱乐部
<13-15,BECKETT>take the S.D. card, and get back to the club.

340
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,160
<13-16,SCARLETT>不  我11点45分出发去博阿的办公室
<13-16,SCARLETT>No, I left for Beau's office at 11:45.

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,110
<13-16,SCARLETT>泊车员看到我开车走的
<13-16,SCARLETT>The valets saw me drive off.

342
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,050
<13-16,SCARLETT>我跟你们说  我没杀人
<13-16,SCARLETT>I am telling you, somebody else did this.

343
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,800
<13-16,SCARLETT>不是蒂芙尼的话  那么
<13-16,SCARLETT>And if it wasn't Tiffany, then...

344
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,590
<13-16,SCARLETT>也许我知道是谁
<13-16,SCARLETT>I think I might know who.

345
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,440
<13-16,SCARLETT>上周在市中心有个人
<13-16,SCARLETT>Last week there was this guy in midtown.

346
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
<13-16,SCARLETT>在大街上袭击了博阿
<13-16,SCARLETT>He practically attacked Beau in the street,

347
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,080
<13-16,SCARLETT>他说会让博阿为自己所做的一切
<13-16,SCARLETT>saying that he would make Beau pay

348
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,480
<13-16,SCARLETT>付出代价
<13-16,SCARLETT>for whatever it was he did.

349
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,900
<13-17,CASTLE>你知道这人是谁吗
<13-17,CASTLE>Do you know who this guy was?

350
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,610
<13-18,SCARLETT>不知道  但他冲到博阿面前
<13-18,SCARLETT>No, but he got in Beau's face.

351
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,860
<13-18,SCARLETT>还向他大吼大叫
<13-18,SCARLETT>And he was yelling at Beau,

352
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,630
<13-18,SCARLETT>说博阿出卖了他
<13-18,SCARLETT>saying that he had double-crossed him.

353
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,440
<13-18,SCARLETT>他动起手来  于是我介入了
<13-18,SCARLETT>He got physical, so I, uh, stepped in.

354
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,700
<13-19,CASTLE>然后呢
<13-19,CASTLE>And then what?

355
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,850
<13-20,SCARLETT>打断了他的鼻子  打断了几根肋骨
<13-20,SCARLETT>Broke his nose and a couple of ribs, I think.

356
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,990
<14-1,ESPOSITO>听见了吗  她打断了他的鼻子
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Oh, did you hear that? She broke his nose.

357
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,840
<14-2,RYAN>那又如何
<14-2,RYAN>Yeah, so?

358
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,160
<14-3,ESPOSITO>太火辣了
<14-3,ESPOSITO>So... that's hot.

359
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,960
<14-4,RYAN>我不认识你
<14-4,RYAN>Who are you?

360
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,450
<14-4,RYAN>你完全不认识他
<14-4,RYAN>And you have no idea who he is?

361
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,960
<14-4,RYAN>不认识  不过再见的话我能认出来
<14-4,RYAN>No, but I'd know if I saw him again.

362
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,330
<14-4,RYAN>斯嘉丽的朋友明蒂证实了
<14-4,RYAN>So... Scarlet's friend Mindy confirmed her story

363
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,200
<14-4,RYAN>性爱录像的说法
<14-4,RYAN>about the sex tape.

364
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,110
<14-4,RYAN>还有两个泊车员看到她在11点45离开俱乐部
<14-4,RYAN>Plus two of the valets saw her leave the club at 11:45.

365
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,510
<16-1,ESPOSITO>她的不在场证明应该成立
<16-1,ESPOSITO>So it looks like her alibi is checking out.

366
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,150
<16-2,BECKETT>你好像特别开心
<16-2,BECKETT>You know, you seem unusually happy about this.

367
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
<16-3,ESPOSITO>没啊  就是
<16-3,ESPOSITO>No, I'm just, you know--

368
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,350
<16-3,ESPOSITO>办案子嘛
<16-3,ESPOSITO>you know, working the case.

369
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
<16-3,ESPOSITO>说到案子
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Speaking of which,

370
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,820
<16-3,ESPOSITO>我们还在找蒂芙尼·肖
<16-3,ESPOSITO>we're still trying to track down Tiffany Shaw,

371
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,650
<16-3,ESPOSITO>但目前还没发现
<16-3,ESPOSITO>but no luck so far.

372
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,990
<16-4,BECKETT>同时  斯嘉丽正在跟画师描述
<16-4,BECKETT>Meantime, Scarlet's working with a sketch artist

373
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,250
<16-4,BECKETT>袭击博阿的人
<16-4,BECKETT>on Beau's attacker.

374
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,690
<16-4,BECKETT>画好了传到医院急诊室去
<16-4,BECKETT>When it's done, send it off to hospital emergency rooms.

375
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,460
<16-4,BECKETT>要是她真像自己说的把人打成那样
<16-4,BECKETT>If she did as much damage as she claims,

376
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,250
<16-4,BECKETT>他应该会去就医
<16-4,BECKETT>then he would've sought medical attention.

377
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,080
<16-5,ESPOSITO>那我去看看素描画得怎么样了
<16-5,ESPOSITO>I should probably go see how the sketch is coming along.

378
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,640
<16-6,BECKETT>去吧
<16-6,BECKETT>Yeah, you do that.

379
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,380
<16-7,RYAN>我一直在看
<16-7,RYAN>So I've been working through

380
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,510
<16-7,RYAN>博阿·兰道夫办公室的恐吓数据库
<16-7,RYAN>the threat database from Beau Randolph's office.

381
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,540
<16-8,BECKETT>有什么发现吗
<16-8,BECKETT>Did anything pop?

382
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,350
<16-9,RYAN>有  这个叫罗纳德·阿姆斯特朗的人
<16-9,RYAN>Yeah. One guy. Ronald Armstrong.

383
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,100
<16-9,RYAN>"体面之声"的创始人
<16-9,RYAN>Founder of Voices for Decency.

384
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,980
<16-10,BECKETT>是不是一直上电视的那个
<16-10,BECKETT>Is that the guy that's on TV all the time,

385
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,750
<16-10,BECKETT>一直推动媒体集团和社区商业
<16-10,BECKETT>the one that's pushing a conservative agenda

386
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,860
<16-10,BECKETT>保守化的人
<16-10,BECKETT>on media groups and community businesses?

387
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,230
<16-11,RYAN>是他  就是他
<16-11,RYAN>Yeah, that's him. He's the one

388
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,080
<16-11,RYAN>就是在俱乐部门口组织示威的人
<16-11,RYAN>who organized the protest outside the nightclub.

389
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,800
<16-12,BECKETT>是吗  有没有证据显示他有暴力倾向
<16-12,BECKETT>Really? Any reason to believe that he's violent?

390
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,290
<16-13,RYAN>这是阿姆斯特朗
<16-13,RYAN>Well, here is a quote

391
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,840
<16-13,RYAN>在网站上给粉丝的回复
<16-13,RYAN>from Armstrong on his web site to his followers.

392
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,300
<16-13,RYAN>"我们的职责就是消灭污秽的传播者"
<16-13,RYAN>"Our work is to rid the nation of the purveyors of filth."

393
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,380
<16-13,RYAN>"如果博阿·兰道夫听不到我们的声音
<16-13,RYAN>"If Beau Randolph doesn't heed our voices,

394
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,980
<16-13,RYAN>他就会看到我们的怒火"
<16-13,RYAN>he must fall to our wrath."

395
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,660
<16-14,BECKETT>但这能说明他是嫌疑人吗
<16-14,BECKETT>But does that make him a suspect?

396
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,740
<16-15,RYAN>也许不是他亲自动手
<16-15,RYAN>Well, maybe not him personally,

397
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,980
<16-15,RYAN>两周前阿姆斯特朗又一次
<16-15,RYAN>but two weeks ago, Armstrong organized

398
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,110
<16-15,RYAN>在兰道夫的公寓外组织了一场示威
<16-15,RYAN>another protest outside Beau Randolph's loft.

399
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,420
<16-15,RYAN>砸了他家窗户  烧了他的照片
<16-15,RYAN>Windows were broken. Beau was burned in effigy.

400
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,090
<16-15,RYAN>闹得很凶
<16-15,RYAN>It got pretty ugly.

401
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,310
<16-15,RYAN>就是昨晚示威的那一帮人
<16-15,RYAN>Those same protesters were outside the nightclub last night.

402
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,300
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>兰道夫先生的死就像他的生活
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>Mr. Randolph's death was like his life--

403
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,790
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>粗俗
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>vulgar...

404
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,900
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>令人作呕
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>offensive.

405
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,960
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>看看我们国家成了什么样
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>Look what's become of our nation.

406
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,880
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>事实上就是他这种人为了谋求利益
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>The truth is that the Beau Randolphs of this world

407
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,800
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>丑化了我们的文化  侮辱了我们的人民
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>profit by degrading our culture and everyone in it.

408
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,310
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>我不会因为捍卫道德观而道歉
<17-1,RONALD ARMSTRONG>I don't apologize for defending moral values.

409
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,210
<17-2,BECKETT>问题是  捍卫起来你会做到什么地步
<17-2,BECKETT>The question is, how far would you go to defend them?

410
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,200
<17-2,BECKETT>你最近组织的那次示威
<17-2,BECKETT>You recently led a protest against him

411
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,150
<17-2,BECKETT>以暴力收场
<17-2,BECKETT>that turned violent.

412
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,210
<17-3,ARMSTRONG>我的几个兄弟有点太热血了
<17-3,ARMSTRONG>A few of my brethren became a bit overzealous,

413
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,020
<17-3,ARMSTRONG>仅此而已
<17-3,ARMSTRONG>That's all.

414
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,160
<17-4,BECKETT>也许是你出言鼓励
<17-4,BECKETT>Maybe your words gave them encouragement.

415
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,230
<17-5,ARMSTRONG>别搞错了  我们在战斗
<17-5,ARMSTRONG>Make no mistake. We are at war.

416
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,850
<17-5,ARMSTRONG>但我只组织好人为他们的原则而战
<17-5,ARMSTRONG>But I simply ask good people to stand up for their principles

417
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,980
<17-5,ARMSTRONG>用法律手段寻求改变
<17-5,ARMSTRONG>and to use any and all legal means to force change.

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,220
<17-6,BECKETT>我需要昨晚在俱乐部门口示威的
<17-6,BECKETT>I will need the names of all of the protesters

419
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,170
<17-6,BECKETT>所有人的名字
<17-6,BECKETT>that were at the club last night.

420
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,330
<17-7,ARMSTRONG>那我谢绝您的请求
<17-7,ARMSTRONG>And I respectfully decline your request.

421
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,520
<17-8,BECKETT>我们能拿到搜查令
<17-8,BECKETT>We can get a warrant.

422
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,840
<17-9,ARMSTRONG>深表怀疑
<17-9,ARMSTRONG>I doubt it.

423
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,940
<17-9,ARMSTRONG>但祝你好运
<17-9,ARMSTRONG>But good luck to you.

424
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,280
<17-9,ARMSTRONG>谢谢你的咖啡
<17-9,ARMSTRONG>Thanks for the coffee.

425
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,210
<18-1,ESPOSITO>就是他找过博阿麻烦吗
<18-1,ESPOSITO>So this is the guy that came after Beau?

426
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,610
<18-2,SCARLETT>如果我知道他会再动手
<18-2,SCARLETT>Yeah. If I knew he was coming back,

427
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,620
<18-2,SCARLETT>就不会只打断他鼻子了
<18-2,SCARLETT>I'd have broken more than just his nose.

428
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,530
<18-3,ESPOSITO>昨晚在俱乐部
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Hey, look, um, about last night at the club...

429
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,830
<18-3,ESPOSITO>我很抱歉  我太过分了
<18-3,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry. I was-- I was way out of line.

430
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,340
<18-4,SCARLETT>我也是
<18-4,SCARLETT>Yeah. So was I.

431
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,910
<18-4,SCARLETT>我应该告诉你们所有的事
<18-4,SCARLETT>I should've come clean with you guys about everything.

432
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,080
<18-4,SCARLETT>再见
<18-4,SCARLETT>See ya.

433
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,030
<18-4,SCARLETT>再见
<18-4,SCARLETT>See you later.

434
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
<18-5,ESPOSITO>斯嘉丽
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, Scarlet.

435
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,210
<18-5,ESPOSITO>能一起喝一杯吗
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Do you think maybe we could get a drink later?

436
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,350
<18-5,ESPOSITO>现在你不是嫌疑人了
<18-5,ESPOSITO>I mean, now that you're not a suspect anymore...

437
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,310
<19-1,ALEXIS>你天天就干这个啊
<19-1,ALEXIS>So this is what you do all day.

438
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,450
<19-1,ALEXIS>悠闲吧
<19-1,ALEXIS>Right?

439
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,320
<19-2,CASTLE>不  这是工作
<19-2,CASTLE>No, it's work. That's...

440
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,520
<19-2,CASTLE>这次的案子
<19-2,CASTLE>That's a case.

<19-3,ALEXIS>我知道  逗你玩呢
<19-3,ALEXIS>I know. I was just messing with you.

<19-3,ALEXIS>你想见我
<19-3,ALEXIS>Uh, so you wanted to see me?

443

<19-4,CASTLE>So, Alexis, I, um... I found your vlog,

<19-4,CASTLE>and while it is super cute, um--

445
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,370
<19-5,ALEXIS>奶奶告诉我了
<19-5,ALEXIS>Yeah, gram told me.

446
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,450
<19-5,ALEXIS>你觉得我会被不怀好意的人利用
<19-5,ALEXIS>You think I'm catnip for predators online.

447
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,520
<19-6,CASTLE>人应该  特别是女性应该
<19-6,CASTLE>I-it's just, people have to be, and especially women,

448
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,090
<19-6,CASTLE>注意不要对外面世界暴露太多
<19-6,CASTLE>need to be leery about how much they put out into the world.

449
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,060
<19-6,CASTLE>我不想看到你以后会因为一时兴起
<19-6,CASTLE>I don't want to see you haunted for years

450
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,480
<19-6,CASTLE>放到网上的东西而苦恼
<19-6,CASTLE>by something you posted on a whim.

451
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
<19-7,ALEXIS>爸  你把我说的跟视频里的女孩一样
<19-7,ALEXIS>Dad, you're acting like I'm one of these girls

452

<19-7,ALEXIS>会为了免费的酒露点
<19-7,ALEXIS>who flashes the camera for a free shot of tequila.

453
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,090
<19-7,ALEXIS>那只是个视博
<19-7,ALEXIS>It's just a silly vlog.

454

<19-8,CASTLE>里面都是个人信息
<19-8,CASTLE>With personal information.

455
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,720
<19-8,CASTLE>万一被坏人看到呢
<19-8,CASTLE>What if the wrong person sees it?

456
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,370
<19-9,ALEXIS>你一直叫我出去看看
<19-9,ALEXIS>You're always pushing me to get out there,

<19-10,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<19-10,CASTLE>Okay, Alexis--

<19-12,BECKETT>想跟我说说吗
<19-12,BECKETT>Anything you want to talk about?

<19-14,BECKETT>Castle, over here.

466
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,240
<19-13,CASTLE>不  不  看
<19-13,CASTLE>No, no, look.

467
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,710
<19-15,CASTLE>这是斯嘉丽说的那个人
<19-15,CASTLE>It's the guy from Scarlet's sketch.

468
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,770
<19-15,CASTLE>找博阿麻烦的那个人
<19-15,CASTLE>It's the man who attacked Beau.

469
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,050
<19-15,CASTLE>看他的鼻子
<19-15,CASTLE>Look at his nose.

470
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,520
<19-15,CASTLE>就是斯嘉丽打的
<19-15,CASTLE>That's from Scarlet hitting him.

471
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,980
<19-15,CASTLE>那晚他就在俱乐部
<19-15,CASTLE>He was at the club last night,

472
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,530
<19-15,CASTLE>也许是继续未尽的事业
<19-15,CASTLE>Probably to finish the job.

473
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,010
<19-16,RYAN>我可以告诉你们他的名字  赛斯·帕里诺
<19-16,RYAN>And I can tell you his name--Seth Parrino.

474
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,570
<19-16,RYAN>我刚给布朗克斯区综合医院的急诊室打过电话
<19-16,RYAN>Just got off the phone with an E.R. nurse at Bronx General.

475
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,040
<19-16,RYAN>帕里诺因为鼻骨和肋骨骨折
<19-16,RYAN>Parrino was treated and released

476
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,730
<19-16,RYAN>进了医院进行了治疗
<19-16,RYAN>for a nasal fracture and some bruised ribs.

477
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,770
<19-17,BECKETT>还知道什么情况
<19-17,BECKETT>What do we know about him?

478
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,810
<19-18,RYAN>他总和暴力扯上关系
<19-18,RYAN>Well, he was no stranger to violence.

479
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,010
<19-18,RYAN>三年前因敲诈被判刑
<19-18,RYAN>He was convicted of racketeering three years ago.

480
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,380
<19-19,BECKETT>知道他现在在哪儿吗
<19-19,BECKETT>You know where we can find him?

481
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,670
<19-20,CASTLE>敲诈人的帕里诺还能有进口公司
<19-20,CASTLE>Racketeering and Parrino owns an import business?

482
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,500
<19-20,CASTLE>我只有五个字要说  贝克特
<19-20,CASTLE>I've got two words for you, Beckett--

483
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,000
<19-20,CASTLE>维托·柯里昂[教父电影中的教父]
<19-20,CASTLE>Vito Corleone.

484
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,890
<19-21,BECKETT>准确的来说  那是名字不是字
<19-21,BECKETT>Technically, those are names, not words.

485
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,100
<19-22,CASTLE>如果博阿·兰道夫曾欺骗过黑手党
<19-22,CASTLE>If Beau Randolph double-crossed a member of the Mafia...

486
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,450
<19-22,CASTLE>那就难怪会死翘翘了
<19-22,CASTLE>no wonder he got whacked.

487
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,830
<19-23,BECKETT>你这推断也太离谱了
<19-23,BECKETT>That is rampant speculation.

488
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,780
<19-24,CASTLE>那是我的专长
<19-24,CASTLE>Rampant speculation is my specialty.

489
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,470
<19-24,CASTLE>如果博阿·兰道夫拍过
<19-24,CASTLE>What if Beau Randolph produced a video

490
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,280
<19-24,CASTLE>黑手党老大女儿的"影像作品"呢
<19-24,CASTLE>featuring the daughter of a Mafia boss,

491
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,940
<19-24,CASTLE>胸罩就变成了黑手党
<19-24,CASTLE>and the brassiere became the Mafia's, uh,

492
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,270
<19-24,CASTLE>特殊的绞喉用具了
<19-24,CASTLE>garrote du jour?

493
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,720
<19-24,CASTLE>帕里诺进出口公司
<19-24,CASTLE>禁止停车

494
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,840
<19-25,BECKETT>你可以闭嘴了
<19-25,BECKETT>You can stop talking now.

495
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,830
<20-1,BECKETT>赛斯·帕里诺
<20-1,BECKETT>Seth Parrino.

496
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,020
<20-2,SETH PARRINO>你们干什么
<20-2,SETH PARRINO>What the hell are you doing?

497
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,300
<20-2,SETH PARRINO>你们不能进来
<20-2,SETH PARRINO>You can't be in here.

498
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,780
<20-3,BECKETT>纽约警局  有几个问题要问你
<20-3,BECKETT>NYPD. We have a few questions.

499
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,800
<20-4,CASTLE>或许不止是问几个问题而已
<20-4,CASTLE>Maybe more than just a few questions.

500
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,440
<20-4,CASTLE>《疯狂男大学生》  不是吧
<20-4,CASTLE>"College Guys Gone Nuts," really?

501
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,070
<21-1,CASTLE>对  对  这商标是我的
<21-1,CASTLE>Yeah, yeah, and I own the trademark,

502
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,950
<21-2,SETH>-所以你就别动脑筋了  -该死
<21-2,SETH>- so don't get any ideas. - Rats.

503
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,700
<21-4,SETH>这里的人都满18岁了  我也有许可证
<21-4,SETH>Look, everybody here is over 18, and I have my permits.

504
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,330
<21-5,CASTLE>我们不是来查你的舞者的  帕里诺先生
<21-5,CASTLE>We're not here about your dancers, Mr. Parrino.

505
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,720
<21-5,CASTLE>是吧
<21-5,CASTLE>Are we?

506
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,340
<21-6,BECKETT>对  不是
<21-6,BECKETT>Right. No.

507
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,860
<21-6,BECKETT>我们是来了解博阿·兰道夫的事
<21-6,BECKETT>We're here about Beau Randolph.

508
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,220
<22-1,SETH>好吧  我们起了分歧
<22-1,SETH>Okay, yeah, yeah, we had a falling out.

509
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,160
<22-1,SETH>我没杀他
<22-1,SETH>I didn't kill anybody.

510
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,660
<22-2,BECKETT>因为什么起了分歧
<22-2,BECKETT>A falling out about what?

511
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,100
<22-2,BECKETT>这个  《疯狂男大学生》
<22-2,BECKETT>This. "College Guys Gone Nuts."

512
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,050
<22-3,SETH>几个月前
<22-3,SETH>A couple months ago,

513
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,550
<22-3,SETH>我去拉他入伙
<22-3,SETH>I approached him about partnering up.

514
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,330
<22-3,SETH>把他的节目性别倒过来
<22-3,SETH>You know, maybe do for women what he did for men.

515
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,130
<22-3,SETH>你们能想象这商业前景吗
<22-3,SETH>Can you imagine the merchandising possibilities,

516
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,650
<22-3,SETH>可以出DVD  网络视频  电子游戏
<22-3,SETH>DVDs, internet, video games.

517
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,720
<22-3,SETH>开始他还答应来着
<22-3,SETH>You know, at first he said he was in.

518
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,250
<22-3,SETH>可突然间
<22-3,SETH>Then all of a sudden, boom.

519
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,080
<22-3,SETH>我还没反应过来  他就改变主意了
<22-3,SETH>Just like that, changes his mind.

520
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,350
<22-4,BECKETT>不明原因吗
<22-4,BECKETT>Can't imagine why.

521
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,230
<22-5,SETH>博阿是个有卓见的人  这点我承认
<22-5,SETH>Beau was a visionary. I grant him that.

522
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,120
<22-5,SETH>他是个有卓见的人
<22-5,SETH>He was a visionary.

523
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,350
<22-5,SETH>可出于某种原因  他就是...
<22-5,SETH>But, uh, for some reason, he just--

524
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,300
<22-5,SETH>他就是不明白  你们懂吗
<22-5,SETH>He--he couldn't-- couldn't see it, you know?

525
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,040
<22-6,CASTLE>我懂  你说得对
<22-6,CASTLE>I get it. You're right.

526
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,020
<22-6,CASTLE>就像是风能  太阳能
<22-6,CASTLE>I mean, it's like wind power. It's, uh, solar energy.

527
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,160
<22-6,CASTLE>就是这样
<22-6,CASTLE>Exactly.

528
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,560
<22-7,SETH>没错
<22-7,SETH>Yeah.

529
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,760
<22-7,SETH>我被打那天
<22-7,SETH>Day this happened,

530
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,270
<22-7,SETH>我发现他准备退出
<22-7,SETH>I found out he was gonna back out on the deal.

531
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,650
<22-7,SETH>说他准备投资
<22-7,SETH>Said he's gonna-- he's gonna invest

532
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,700
<22-7,SETH>其它项目
<22-7,SETH>in something else--

533
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,290
<22-7,SETH>儿童项目  或类似的玩意儿
<22-7,SETH>Oh, kids programming or something like that.

534
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,200
<22-7,SETH>好像我不知道他就是要打发我
<22-7,SETH>Like I couldn't tell he was just blowing me off.

535
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,320
<22-7,SETH>然后他让那保镖打我
<22-7,SETH>And then he sics that bodyguard on me.

536
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,220
<22-8,BECKETT>你那晚为什么去俱乐部
<22-8,BECKETT>Why did you go to the club that night?

537
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,300
<22-9,SETH>我试图做最后的努力
<22-9,SETH>I was trying to make a final pitch.

538
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,490
<22-9,SETH>再给他一次机会
<22-9,SETH>You know, give him one more chance to--

539
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,870
<22-9,SETH>答应和我合伙  再给发疯一次机会
<22-9,SETH>to--to say yes, one more chance to go nuts.

540
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,360
<22-10,CASTLE>我想他拒绝了
<22-10,CASTLE>I take it he said no.

541
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,070
<22-11,SETH>我还没机会问  他就死了
<22-11,SETH>Oh, I never got a chance to ask.

542
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,140
<22-11,SETH>我从后面跑去找他
<22-11,SETH>I ran into him in the back,

543
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,630
<22-11,SETH>他当时正在和某个女孩吵架
<22-11,SETH>and he was having a fight with some chick.

544
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,930
<22-11,SETH>场面很激烈
<22-11,SETH>It looked nasty.

545
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,640
<22-11,SETH>我想当时不是时候
<22-11,SETH>I just, I figured, you know, it wasn't the time.

546
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,950
<22-12,BECKETT>当时几点
<22-12,BECKETT>And when was this?

547
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,150
<22-13,SETH>11点半左右吧
<22-13,SETH>God, like 11:30 or so.

548
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,390
<22-13,SETH>11点半
<22-13,SETH>11:30?

549
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,150
<22-14,BECKETT>你能描述一下这个女人吗
<22-14,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe this woman?

550
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,590
<22-15,SETH>可以  她头发是短棕色的
<22-15,SETH>Yeah, yeah, yeah, she has, uh... short brown hair,

551
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,930
<22-15,SETH>身材很辣
<22-15,SETH>Smokin' hot body.

552
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,420
<22-15,SETH>对了  她嘴唇上方有颗痣
<22-15,SETH>Oh, and she had a mole right over her lip.

553
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,260
<23-1,ESPOSITO>就是她  赛斯·帕里诺的神秘女人
<23-1,ESPOSITO>Here she is-- Seth Parrino's mystery woman.

554
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,250
<23-2,BECKETT>好  把她的照片发给派对组织方
<23-2,BECKETT>All right, send her photo to the party organizers.

555
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,140
<23-2,BECKETT>看看是否有人认得出
<23-2,BECKETT>See if anyone recognizes her.

556
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,220
<23-3,ESPOSITO>没必要
<23-3,ESPOSITO>No need.

557
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,510
<23-3,ESPOSITO>看她那颗痣
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Check out that mole.

559
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,570
<23-3,ESPOSITO>眼熟吗
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Look familiar?

560
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,900
<23-4,BECKETT>这么说  博阿的前女友
<23-4,BECKETT>So Beau's ex-girlfriend

561
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,630
<23-4,BECKETT>蒂芙尼·肖当时在场
<23-4,BECKETT>Tiffany Shaw was there.

562
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,940
<23-5,ESPOSITO>她一定是乔装打扮后
<23-5,ESPOSITO>She must have disguised herself,

563
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,600
<23-5,ESPOSITO>趁斯嘉丽离开后偷溜进了俱乐部
<23-5,ESPOSITO>then slipped in to the club after Scarlet left.

564
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,180
<23-6,BECKETT>发逮捕令抓她
<23-6,BECKETT>Get out a warrant on her.

565
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,910
<23-7,ESPOSITO>能让莱恩去吗
<23-7,ESPOSITO>You think we could have Ryan do that?

566
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,160
<23-7,ESPOSITO>我还有约
<23-7,ESPOSITO>I have plans.

567
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,470
<23-8,BECKETT>是吗  谁啊
<23-8,BECKETT>Really? Do these plans have a name?

568
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,410
<23-9,BECKETT>我擦  你不是吧
<23-9,BECKETT>Oh, shut up. You didn't.

569
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,980
<23-10,ESPOSITO>她把人鼻子给打断了  想象一下性爱场面吧
<23-10,ESPOSITO>She broke a guy's nose. You know she's gotta be freaky.

570
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,520
<23-11,ESPOSITO>拜托
<23-11,ESPOSITO>Come on.

571
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,560
<23-12,RYAN>你去哪里
<23-12,RYAN>Hey, where you going?

572
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,410
<23-13,BECKETT>别问了  有进展吗
<23-13,BECKETT>Don't ask. You got anything?

573
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,200
<23-14,RYAN>没想到我在读完六年级后
<23-14,RYAN>Well, um... I never thought I'd say this

574
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,680
<23-14,RYAN>还会说这些话
<23-14,RYAN>after graduating the sixth grade,

575
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,020
<23-14,RYAN>我们在进行文胸调查
<23-14,RYAN>but our bra research is in.

576
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,690
<23-14,RYAN>发现六个女人买的苏特拉牌文胸
<23-14,RYAN>Turns out six women purchased a Sultura bra

577
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,460
<23-14,RYAN>大小和款式和凶器相同
<23-14,RYAN>identical to the size and model of our murder weapon

578
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,330
<23-14,RYAN>都是在上东区同一家内衣店买的
<23-14,RYAN>from the same upper east side lingerie shop--

579
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,460
<23-14,RYAN>店名叫欲望
<23-14,RYAN>Carnal Desires.

580
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,590
<23-14,RYAN>这六个人中  有一个很显眼
<23-14,RYAN>Of the six, one name stood out.

581
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,520
<23-15,BECKETT>-蒂芙尼·肖  -越来越明朗了
<23-15,BECKETT>- Tiffany Shaw. - It gets better.

582
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,930
<23-16,RYAN>显然她把自己的弄丢了
<23-16,RYAN>Apparently she must have lost hers,

583
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,340
<23-16,RYAN>因为她今早给店里打电话
<23-16,RYAN>because she called the shop this morning

584
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,010
<23-16,RYAN>问是不是还有库存
<23-16,RYAN>to see if they had another one in stock.

585
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,200
<23-16,RYAN>她这时候正在去取件的路上
<23-16,RYAN>She's on her way in to get it right now.

586
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,750
<23-17,BECKETT>她旧的还在这里
<23-17,BECKETT>You know, it seems like such a shame

587
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,120
<23-17,BECKETT>我们就害她只好去买新的  还真是不好意思
<23-17,BECKETT>to have her buy a new one when her old one is right here.

588
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,700
<24-1,TIFFANY SHAW>天呐  我的文胸
<24-1,TIFFANY SHAW>Oh, my god. My bra.

589
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,900
<24-1,TIFFANY SHAW>太感谢了
<24-1,TIFFANY SHAW>Thank you so much.

590
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,090
<24-1,TIFFANY SHAW>你们在哪里找到的
<24-1,TIFFANY SHAW>Where did you guys find this?

591
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,960
<24-2,BECKETT>绕在博阿·兰道夫的脖子上
<24-2,BECKETT>Wrapped around Beau Randolph's neck,

592
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
<24-2,BECKETT>把他给勒死了
<24-2,BECKETT>strangling him to death.

593
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,890
<24-3,TIFFANY>等等  你们该不会以为
<24-3,TIFFANY>Wait. You guys don't think

594
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,640
<24-3,TIFFANY>我和他的死有关吧
<24-3,TIFFANY>that I had anything to do with this, do you?

595
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,220
<24-4,BECKETT>凶器是你的
<24-4,BECKETT>The murder weapon belongs to you.

596
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,250
<24-4,BECKETT>死者有对你的禁令
<24-4,BECKETT>Our victim had a restraining order against you.

597
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,690
<24-4,BECKETT>而你那晚又执意要见他
<24-4,BECKETT>And you were so determined to get to see him that night

598
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,380
<24-4,BECKETT>你换了身装扮  躲过安保
<24-4,BECKETT>that you changed your appearance in order to get past security.

599
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,880
<24-4,BECKETT>不是你们想的那样
<24-4,BECKETT>It's not what you think.

600
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,250
<24-5,TIFFANY>听着  我只是想跟他说话
<24-5,TIFFANY>Look, I just wanted to talk to him.

601
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,600
<24-5,TIFFANY>我们俩是灵魂伴侣
<24-5,TIFFANY>The two of us were soul mates.

602
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,720
<24-5,TIFFANY>几个月前  他变了
<24-5,TIFFANY>And then a couple of months ago, he changes.

603
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,490
<24-5,TIFFANY>变得很严肃  很偷偷摸摸
<24-5,TIFFANY>He got so serious, so secretive.

604
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,180
<24-5,TIFFANY>后来冷不丁他就甩了我
<24-5,TIFFANY>And then out of the blue, he just dumps me

605
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,940
<24-5,TIFFANY>没有原因
<24-5,TIFFANY>for no reason.

606
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,230
<24-5,TIFFANY>我只想知道原因
<24-5,TIFFANY>I just wanted to know why.

607
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,750
<24-5,TIFFANY>我有权知道原因
<24-5,TIFFANY>I deserved to know why.

608
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,200
<24-6,CASTLE>于是你去俱乐部
<24-6,CASTLE>So you went to the club

609
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,170
<24-6,CASTLE>和他对峙
<24-6,CASTLE>to confront him.

610
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,480
<24-7,TIFFANY>你猜他说了什么
<24-7,TIFFANY>And do you know what he said?

611
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,070
<24-7,TIFFANY>他说我不是他与之共度余生的那种人
<24-7,TIFFANY>He said that I wasn't the kind of person that he could be with anymore.

612
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,970
<24-7,TIFFANY>好像他是圣人一样
<24-7,TIFFANY>Like he's such a saint.

613
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,890
<24-7,TIFFANY>然后他说  如果我再出现
<24-7,TIFFANY>And then he said if I showed up again,

614
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,360
<24-7,TIFFANY>他就报警抓我
<24-7,TIFFANY>he'd have me arrested.

615
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,550
<24-8,BECKETT>这话够狠的  你一定很生气吧
<24-8,BECKETT>That's pretty harsh. That must have made you angry.

616
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,530
<24-9,TIFFANY>这还用问  我当然生气
<24-9,TIFFANY>Damn right, it made me angry.

617
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,450
<24-9,TIFFANY>我想好好收拾他一顿
<24-9,TIFFANY>I wanted to hurt him so bad.

618
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,160
<24-10,BECKETT>所以你就去了洗手间
<24-10,BECKETT>So you went into the bathroom...

619
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,850
<24-10,BECKETT>杀了他
<24-10,BECKETT>and then you killed him.

620
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,270
<24-11,TIFFANY>什么
<24-11,TIFFANY>Wh-what?

621
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,510
<24-12,BECKETT>你杀了他
<24-12,BECKETT>You killed him.

622
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,060
<24-13,TIFFANY>不  我可没杀他
<24-13,TIFFANY>Whoa. Okay. No, I didn't kill him.

623
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,560
<24-14,CASTLE>你刚才说你要好好收拾他
<24-14,CASTLE>You just said you wanted to hurt him so bad.

624
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,130
<24-14,CASTLE>是的
<24-14,CASTLE>Yeah,

625
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,180
<24-15,TIFFANY>所以我就随便找了人
<24-15,TIFFANY>so I grabbed the nearest guy

626
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,070
<24-15,TIFFANY>拉他进洗手间干了一炮  就当是报复
<24-15,TIFFANY>and pulled him into the bathroom for revenge sex.

627
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,320
<24-16,BECKETT>那你的内衣怎么会
<24-16,BECKETT>Then how did your bra end up

628
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,480
<24-2,BECKETT>缠在博阿·兰道夫的脖子上呢
<24-2,BECKETT>wrapped around Beau Randolph's neck?

629
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,170
<24-17,TIFFANY>我一定是落在洗手间里了
<24-17,TIFFANY>I must have left it in the bathroom.

630
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,080
<24-17,TIFFANY>你在夜店里干过那事吗  警探
<24-17,TIFFANY>You ever do it in a nightclub, detective,

631
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,810
<24-17,TIFFANY>"辣"得浑身是汗  还得快着点
<24-17,TIFFANY>Hot, sweaty, quick?

632
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,090
<24-17,TIFFANY>丢东西是正常的
<24-17,TIFFANY>Things go missing.

633
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,630
<24-18,BECKETT>那人能证明你说的话吗
<24-18,BECKETT>Can this guy confirm your story?

634
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,120
<24-19,TIFFANY>证明
<24-19,TIFFANY>Confirm it?

635
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:46,890
<24-19,TIFFANY>我很了解男人
<24-19,TIFFANY>I mean, knowing men,

636
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,660
<24-19,TIFFANY>他可能已经让整个东海岸的人都知道了
<24-19,TIFFANY>he's probably told the entire east coast already.

637
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,950
<24-20,BECKETT>那么他叫什么
<24-20,BECKETT>So what's his name?

638
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:54,650
<24-21,CASTLE>你不知他的名字
<24-21,CASTLE>You don't know his name.

639
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,510
<24-22,TIFFANY>那只是夜店里的一夜情
<24-22,TIFFANY>It was club sex.

640
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,320
<24-22,TIFFANY>我知道这很蠢
<24-22,TIFFANY>Look, I know it was stupid.

641
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,700
<24-22,TIFFANY>完事后我觉得糟透了  就离开了
<24-22,TIFFANY>Afterward, I felt awful, so I left.

642
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,920
<24-23,BECKETT>那时是几点
<24-23,BECKETT>And what time was that?

643
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,840
<24-24,TIFFANY>11点45分  你可以去问司机
<24-24,TIFFANY>11:45. You can call my driver.

644
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,340
<24-24,TIFFANY>我离开夜店的时候
<24-24,TIFFANY>And when I walked out of that club,

645
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,190
<24-24,TIFFANY>博阿还活着
<24-24,TIFFANY>Beau was still alive.

646
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,300
<24-24,TIFFANY>听我说  我比任何人都了解博阿
<24-24,TIFFANY>Look, I knew Beau better than anyone,

647
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,150
<24-24,TIFFANY>他一定遇到了什么事
<24-24,TIFFANY>and something wasn't right.

648
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,950
<24-24,TIFFANY>从他的眼神我就能看出来
<24-24,TIFFANY>I could see it in his eyes.

649
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,430
<24-24,TIFFANY>起初我以为他有了别的女人
<24-24,TIFFANY>At first I thought it was another woman,

650
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,830
<24-24,TIFFANY>所以我就跟踪他看看到底是谁
<24-24,TIFFANY>so I followed him to find out who it was.

651
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,140
<24-24,TIFFANY>但当我发现他保镖的真正目的后
<24-24,TIFFANY>But when I saw what that bodyguard of his was up to,

652
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,310
<24-24,TIFFANY>我就知道一定是什么大事
<24-24,TIFFANY>I knew it was something bigger.

653
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,350
<24-25,CASTLE>她有什么目的
<24-25,CASTLE>What was she up to?

654
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,930
<24-26,TIFFANY>肯定不是好事
<24-26,TIFFANY>Nothing good.

655
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,930
<24-26,TIFFANY>几个星期之前  我跟踪了她
<24-26,TIFFANY>A couple of weeks ago, I followed her.

656
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,820
<24-26,TIFFANY>她穿过了布赖恩特公园后
<24-26,TIFFANY>She was crossing Bryant park,

657
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,640
<24-26,TIFFANY>突然来到一个垃圾箱前
<24-26,TIFFANY>and suddenly, she reaches into a trash bin

658
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,380
<24-26,TIFFANY>取出来这个
<24-26,TIFFANY>and pulls out this--

659
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,730
<24-26,TIFFANY>一袋现金
<24-26,TIFFANY>a bag of cash.

660
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,880
<25-1,CASTLE>斯嘉丽越来越神秘了
<25-1,CASTLE>So the mystery of Scarlet deepens.

661
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,940
<25-1,CASTLE>涉及到从垃圾箱取出一袋现金的杀人案
<25-1,CASTLE>A dead drop involving a bag of cash and a trash bin,

662
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,360
<25-1,CASTLE>她还让我们去追踪假线索
<25-1,CASTLE>sending us after false leads at every turn--

663
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,070
<25-1,CASTLE>这可是经典的间谍手段
<25-1,CASTLE>This is classic spy craft.

664
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,640
<25-1,CASTLE>但那些钱是谁给的  她又在为谁工作呢
<25-1,CASTLE>But whose money is it and who is she really working for?

665
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,140
<25-2,BECKETT>斯嘉丽前几份工作是为500强公司
<25-2,BECKETT>Scarlet's last few jobs were doing high-level consulting

666
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,080
<25-2,BECKETT>做高级顾问
<25-2,BECKETT>for Fortune-500 companies.

667
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,900
<25-2,BECKETT>这与给博阿·兰道夫当保镖可是天壤之别
<25-2,BECKETT>That's a far cry from babysitting Beau Randolph.

668
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,610
<25-3,CASTLE>可能她仍然在为某个公司工作
<25-3,CASTLE>Maybe she's still working for one of them.

669
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,060
<25-3,CASTLE>或许她的工作就是接近博阿
<25-3,CASTLE>Maybe her job with Beau was just to get

670
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,160
<25-3,CASTLE>以便完成她真正的任务
<25-3,CASTLE>close enough to him to accomplish her real mission.

671
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,270
<25-4,BECKETT>是啊  鬼知道那是什么
<25-4,BECKETT>Yeah, whatever that was.

672
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,030
<25-5,RYAN>我刚跟斯嘉丽的朋友明蒂聊过
<25-5,RYAN>Hey, so I just spoke with Scarlet's friend Mindy.

673
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,930
<25-5,RYAN>在我跟她解释了
<25-5,RYAN>After I explained to her

674
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,400
<25-5,RYAN>什么是妨碍司法公正后
<25-5,RYAN>what obstruction of justice looks like,

675
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,760
<25-5,RYAN>她承认斯嘉丽给了她1000美元
<25-5,RYAN>she admitted that Scarlet paid her $1,000

676
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,880
<25-5,RYAN>让她为SD卡说辞打圆场
<25-5,RYAN>to vouch for that story about the SD card.

677
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,780
<25-5,RYAN>无论卡里存了什么
<25-5,RYAN>Whatever's on it,

678
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,600
<25-5,RYAN>肯定不是她和博阿的性爱录像
<25-5,RYAN>it's not a sex tape of her and Beau.

679
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,620
<25-6,CASTLE>但那到底是什么
<25-6,CASTLE>Okay, so what the hell is it

680
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,810
<25-6,CASTLE>而她为什么迫不及待地想要得到呢
<25-6,CASTLE>and why does she want it so bad?

681
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,920
<25-7,BECKETT>我想我知道怎样找出事实真相
<25-7,BECKETT>You know, I think I know how we can find out.

682
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,840
<26-1,SCARLETT>基本上是任何事
<26-1,SCARLETT>Pretty much everything.

683
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,530
<26-2,ESPOSITO>你太强了
<26-2,ESPOSITO>You're super strong.

684
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,090
<26-2,ESPOSITO>我就说嘛
<26-2,ESPOSITO>I'm just saying.

686
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,690
<26-3,SCARLETT>有什么事吗
<26-3,SCARLETT>Is everything okay?

687
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,540
<26-4,ESPOSITO>没有  只是同事的电话
<26-4,ESPOSITO>It's-- nah, it's just work.

688
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,690
<26-4,ESPOSITO>看来有时他们离了我不行
<26-4,ESPOSITO>It seems like they can't operate without me sometimes.

689
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,520
<26-4,ESPOSITO>你懂的
<26-4,ESPOSITO>You know how it is.

690
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,530
<26-4,ESPOSITO>你是想再来一杯呢
<26-4,ESPOSITO>So do you want to get another drink

691
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,540
<26-4,ESPOSITO>还是去找个地方吃点东西
<26-4,ESPOSITO>or maybe get a table and get some dinner?

692
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,680
<26-5,SCARLETT>去我那继续聊聊怎么样
<26-5,SCARLETT>How about we continue this conversation at my place?

693
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,320
<26-6,ESPOSITO>好啊
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Okay.

694
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,770
<26-6,ESPOSITO>或者
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Or...

695
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,050
<26-7,BECKETT>更好一些
<26-7,BECKETT>better yet...

696
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,160
<26-7,BECKETT>去我那继续聊聊怎么样
<26-7,BECKETT>why don't we continue this conversation back at my place?

697
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,930
<26-7,BECKETT>她又性感
<26-7,BECKETT>She's hot.

698
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,980
<27-1,ESPOSITO>又能打  还是商业间谍
<27-1,ESPOSITO>She kicks ass. She's a corporate spy.

699
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,670
<27-1,ESPOSITO>天啊  她太完美了
<27-1,ESPOSITO>Man, she is perfect.

700
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,000
<27-1,ESPOSITO>她为什么要当坏人呢
<27-1,ESPOSITO>Why'd she have to be the bad guy?

701
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,450
<27-2,RYAN>很抱歉我们把你"截鸡"  哥们
<27-2,RYAN>Sorry we had to cop block you, bro.

702
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,460
<27-3,SCARLETT>你知道这有多荒唐吗
<27-3,SCARLETT>You know this is ridiculous.

703
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,040
<27-3,SCARLETT>我跟博阿·兰道夫的死一点关系都没有
<27-3,SCARLETT>I had nothing to do with Beau Randolph's death.

704
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,850
<27-4,BECKETT>我知道你没说实话
<27-4,BECKETT>I also know that you lied to us.

705
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,860
<28-1,SCARLETT>我有不在场证据
<28-1,SCARLETT>I have an alibi.

706
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,950
<28-2,BECKETT>那张SD卡上有什么  还有你在为谁工作
<28-2,BECKETT>What was on the SD card and who do you work for?

707
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,270
<28-3,SCARELTT>我已经告诉过你了
<28-3,SCARELTT>I already told you.

708
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,760
<28-4,BECKETT>你当保镖不是为了取回性爱录像
<28-4,BECKETT>You didn't take that job to get back a sex tape.

709
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,910
<28-4,BECKETT>你的朋友明蒂已经撤销了她的供词
<28-4,BECKETT>and your friend Mindy already recanted her story.

710
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,960
<28-4,BECKETT>我不相信博阿付薪酬的方式是
<28-4,BECKETT>And I highly doubt that Beau paid you

711
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,620
<28-4,BECKETT>把钱放在垃圾箱里
<28-4,BECKETT>by leaving cash in a trash bin.

712
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,440
<28-4,BECKETT>你还是别演戏了
<28-4,BECKETT>So why don't you drop the act

713
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,170
<28-4,BECKETT>告诉我到底发生了什么
<28-4,BECKETT>and tell me what the hell is going on

714
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,340
<28-4,BECKETT>还有那张卡上有什么
<28-4,BECKETT>and what was on that card?

715
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,860
<28-5,SCARLETT>我不知道
<28-5,SCARLETT>I don't know.

716
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,560
<28-5,SCARLETT>-斯嘉丽  -我不知道
<28-5,SCARLETT>- Scarlet.  - I don't know.

717
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,130
<28-7,SCARLETT>你真觉得我会相信
<28-7,SCARLETT>Do you actually expect me to believe

718
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,850
<28-8,BECKETT>你对你偷的卡上有什么内容一无所知吗
<28-8,BECKETT>that you have no idea what was on the thing that you stole?

719
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,090
<28-9,SCARLETT>我只知道
<28-9,SCARLETT>All I know is that

720
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,250
<28-9,SCARLETT>博阿对那张卡非常在意  甚至疑神疑鬼
<28-9,SCARLETT>Beau was obsessed about it, paranoid.

721
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,780
<28-9,SCARLETT>所以我想那就是我的雇主想要的东西
<28-9,SCARLETT>So I figured it's exactly what my employer was looking for.

722
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,210
<28-10,BECKETT>他们让你找什么东西
<28-10,BECKETT>What did they send you to find?

723
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,500
<28-11,SCARLETT>丑闻
<28-11,SCARLETT>Dirt.

724
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,300
<28-11,SCARLETT>对博阿不利的证据
<28-11,SCARLETT>Uh, incriminating evidence they could use against Beau.

725
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,400
<28-12,BECKETT>谁是你的雇主
<28-12,BECKETT>Who? Who's your employer?

726
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,650
<29-1,BECKETT>斯嘉丽  无论你说不说我都会查出来
<29-1,BECKETT>Scarlet, I'm gonna find out whether you tell me or not,

727
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,700
<29-1,BECKETT>除非你跟我们合作  否则如果他们
<29-1,BECKETT>and if they were involved in Beau Rndolph's death,

728
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,700
<29-1,BECKETT>跟博阿·兰道夫的死有关  你就是共犯
<29-1,BECKETT>then that makes you an accomplice unless you help.

729
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,880
<29-2,SCARLETT>小青蛙公司
<29-2,SCARLETT>Little Frog Enterprises.

730
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,140
<29-2,SCARLETT>是小青蛙公司雇的我
<29-2,SCARLETT>I was hired by Little Frog Enterprises.

731
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,350
<29-2,SCARLETT>小青蛙公司  那个制作儿童节目的公司
<29-2,SCARLETT>Little Frog Enterprises, the children's media company?

732
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,790
<30-1,CASTLE>这讲不通啊
<30-1,CASTLE>That makes no sense.

733
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,550
<30-2,BECKETT>博阿跟赛斯·帕里诺说过
<30-2,BECKETT>Beau told Seth Parrino that he was investing

734
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,150
<30-2,BECKETT>他在给儿童节目投资
<30-2,BECKETT>in children's programming,

735
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,550
<30-2,BECKETT>或许有些关联
<30-2,BECKETT>So maybe it's related.

736
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,260
<30-3,CASTLE>这又怎样  难道《摇摆尾》
<30-3,CASTLE>So what, the folks behind "The Jigglewags"

737
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,020
<30-3,CASTLE>和《欢乐玩偶秀》的制作人
<30-3,CASTLE>and "Happy Polly's Puppet Playtime"

738
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,290
<30-3,CASTLE>是杀死博阿的幕后黑手吗
<30-3,CASTLE>are the people pulling the strings behind Beau's death?

739
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,880
<30-4,BECKETT>我们能确定的是
<30-4,BECKETT>Well, all we know for sure is that they were trying

740
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,790
<30-4,BECKETT>他们想挖掘博阿的丑闻
<30-4,BECKETT>to dig up some dirt on Beau.

741
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,240
<30-5,CASTLE>这个男人生活中充满丑闻
<30-5,CASTLE>The man's life was dirt.

742
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,340
<30-5,CASTLE>他甚至都没有脱离金钱关系的炮友
<30-5,CASTLE>He hardly had a sexual encounter he didn't try to monetize.

743
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,760
<30-5,CASTLE>他们想找什么
<30-5,CASTLE>What are they hoping to find?

744
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,310
<30-6,BECKETT>还有  找到了又能怎样
<30-6,BECKETT>And what were they planning on doing with it?

745
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,710
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>很抱歉  警探
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>I'm sorry, Detective,

746
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,530
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>但是你们找错人了
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>but, uh, you got the wrong guy.

747
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,600
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>我在正规的家庭娱乐公司工作
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>I, uh, I work in wholesome family entertainment,

748
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,780
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>不搞不正当行业
<31-1,EVAN PIERCE>Not smut.

749
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,480
<31-2,BECKETT>但你或是你们公司的人
<31-2,BECKETT>And yet you or someone from your company

750
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,120
<31-2,BECKETT>雇用了斯嘉丽·琼斯渗入博阿·兰道夫的公司
<31-2,BECKETT>hired Scarlet Jones to infiltrate Beau Randolph's company

751
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,110
<31-2,BECKETT>并暗中监视他
<31-2,BECKETT>and spy on him.

752
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,550
<31-3,CASTLE>我们猜想  作为公司创办者和总经理
<31-3,CASTLE>We figured as founder and C.E.O.,

753
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,580
<31-3,CASTLE>你可能知情
<31-3,CASTLE>you might know something about that.

754
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,750
<31-4,EVAN>听着  你得理解
<31-4,EVAN>Look, you have to understand.

755
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,710
<31-4,EVAN>我建立这家公司是为了我的子女
<31-4,EVAN>I... I built this company for my children, okay,

756
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,020
<31-4,EVAN>我的子孙
<31-4,EVAN>for my grandchildren,

757
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,230
<31-4,EVAN>好让父母们不必担心
<31-4,EVAN>So parents wouldn't have to worry

758
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,130
<31-4,EVAN>孩子们接触到性和暴力
<31-4,EVAN>about their kids being exposed to sex and violence.

759
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,160
<31-5,CASTLE>很抱歉  但这和博阿有什么关系呢
<31-5,CASTLE>I'm sorry. What does this have to do with Beau?

760
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,900
<31-6,EVAN>我们公司发展得太快
<31-6,EVAN>We expanded too quickly.

761
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,410
<31-6,EVAN>大佬们对我们虎视眈眈
<31-6,EVAN>Sharks were circling.

762
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,580
<31-6,EVAN>六周前  博阿·兰道夫找到我
<31-6,EVAN>Six weeks ago, Beau Randolph approached me

763
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,620
<31-6,EVAN>说他可以帮我
<31-6,EVAN>and, uh, he said he could help.

764
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,850
<31-6,EVAN>他说他有丰厚的现金储备
<31-6,EVAN>He said he had large cash reserves

765
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,270
<31-6,EVAN>正在寻找投资机会
<31-6,EVAN>and he was looking to invest.

766
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,820
<31-7,BECKETT>博阿为什么想要投资小青蛙公司呢
<31-7,BECKETT>Why would Beau want to invest in Little Frog?

767
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,700
<31-8,EVAN>他说他不想
<31-8,EVAN>He said that, uh, he didn't want

768
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,730
<31-8,EVAN>让"疯狂女大学生"成为他的遗产
<31-8,EVAN>"College Girls Gone Crazy" to be his legacy.

769
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,360
<31-8,EVAN>他说他想做别的生意
<31-8,EVAN>He said he wanted to do more.

770
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,560
<31-8,EVAN>他看中了我们公司
<31-8,EVAN>He liked the company.

771
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,250
<31-9,CASTLE>我猜想你不赞同他的提议
<31-9,CASTLE>I take it you weren't interested.

772
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,990
<31-10,EVAN>当然  难道要让那家伙的肮脏名声
<31-10,EVAN>What, and let that guy's sleazy reputation

773
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,190
<31-10,EVAN>玷污我辛苦建立的一切吗
<31-10,EVAN>taint everything I worked so hard to build?

774
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,410
<31-10,EVAN>绝不  我知道他在盘算什么
<31-10,EVAN>No. I knew exactly what he was doing.

775
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,980
<31-10,EVAN>他想利用我们公司的名声
<31-10,EVAN>He was trying to use my company

776
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,150
<31-10,EVAN>为自己正名
<31-10,EVAN>to legitimize himself.

777
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,040
<31-10,EVAN>他想利用它来获取
<31-10,EVAN>He wanted to use it to obtain something

778
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,760
<31-10,EVAN>他自己无法获得的东西
<31-10,EVAN>he couldn't earn on his own.

779
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,930
<31-11,CASTLE>什么东西
<31-11,CASTLE>And what's that?

780
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,550
<31-12,EVAN>尊敬
<31-12,EVAN>Respect.

781
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,800
<31-12,EVAN>我拒绝他之后  他向董事会提议
<31-12,EVAN>After I said no, he took his proposal to the board.

782
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,600
<31-12,EVAN>董事会很欣赏他的提议
<31-12,EVAN>They seemed to like his offer.

783
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,690
<31-12,EVAN>我只想找到压制他的办法
<31-12,EVAN>I was just looking for some leverage.

784
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,900
<31-12,EVAN>我想令他退缩
<31-12,EVAN>I just needed something to make him back off.

785
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,200
<31-13,BECKETT>你确定吗
<31-13,BECKETT>Are you sure about that?

786
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,820
<31-13,BECKETT>考虑到你做过的这些事
<31-13,BECKETT>'Cause given everything you've already done,

787
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,070
<31-13,BECKETT>雇人溜进那个派对干掉他
<31-13,BECKETT>it would've been easy to hire someone

788
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,180
<31-13,BECKETT>简直是轻而易举
<31-13,BECKETT>to slip into that party and just make it go away.

789
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,660
<31-13,BECKETT>我和他的死无关
<31-13,BECKETT>I had nothing to do with his death.

790
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,180
<31-14,EVAN>但我或许知道是谁干的
<31-14,EVAN>But I might know who did.

791
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,090
<31-14,EVAN>斯嘉丽
<31-14,EVAN>Scarlet...

792
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,370
<31-14,EVAN>说他无比看重这张记忆卡
<31-14,EVAN>said he guarded this SD card with his life.

793
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,340
<31-14,EVAN>现在我知道原因了
<31-14,EVAN>Now I know why.

794
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,000
<31-14,EVAN>我本想用这个对付兰道夫
<31-14,EVAN>I thought I could use it as leverage against Randolph,

795
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,730
<31-14,EVAN>但是
<31-14,EVAN>but, uh,

796
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,910
<31-14,EVAN>现在看来  很明显
<31-14,EVAN>well, now it's pretty clear

797
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,770
<31-14,EVAN>他曾用这个勒索过其他人
<31-14,EVAN>he was using it to blackmail someone else.

798
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,890
<31-15,CASTLE>里面记录了什么东西
<31-15,CASTLE>What's on it?

799
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,110
<31-16,EVAN>不是东西
<31-16,EVAN>It's not what.

800
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,090
<31-16,EVAN>是人
<31-16,EVAN>It's who.

801
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,720
<32-1,ESPOSITO>这是一盘性爱录像带  那又如何
<32-1,ESPOSITO>It's a sex tape. So what?

802
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,270
<32-1,ESPOSITO>像博阿这样的家伙  这种录像多得是
<32-1,ESPOSITO>A guy like Beau could have dozens of these.

803
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,730
<32-2,BECKETT>录像带没什么  关键是那个女孩
<32-2,BECKETT>It's not the tape. It's the girl.

804
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,570
<32-2,BECKETT>我要看看她的脸
<32-2,BECKETT>I need a shot of her face.

805
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,170
<32-3,ESPOSITO>我们见过她
<32-3,ESPOSITO>We know her.

806
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,790
<32-3,ESPOSITO>夜总会里穿粉色衣服的女孩
<32-3,ESPOSITO>That's the girl in pink from the nightclub.

807
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,820
<32-4,RYAN>是的  我们那晚录了她的口供
<32-4,RYAN>Yeah. We took her statement that night.

808
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,210
<32-4,RYAN>她说她不认识博阿
<32-4,RYAN>She said didn't know Beau.

809
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,030
<32-5,BECKETT>我想她撒了谎
<32-5,BECKETT>Well... I think she lied.

810
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,260
<32-5,BECKETT>她叫什么名字
<32-5,BECKETT>So what's her name?

811
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,730
<33-1,RYAN>坎迪斯·梅菲尔德  25岁
<33-1,RYAN>Candice Mayfield, 25.

812
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,050
<33-2,BECKETT>根据你的记录
<33-2,BECKETT>According to your report,

813
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,250
<33-2,BECKETT>她正是在博阿·兰道夫死前
<33-2,BECKETT>she is literally one of the last people

814
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,190
<33-2,BECKETT>最后见过的几个人之一
<33-2,BECKETT>to see Beau Randolph alive.

815
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,600
<33-3,CASTLE>她有什么特别
<33-3,CASTLE>Okay. So what's so special about her?

816
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,980
<33-4,RYAN>据我所知  没有
<33-4,RYAN>As far as I could see, nothing.

817
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,390
<33-4,RYAN>她是一名幼儿园教师
<33-4,RYAN>She's a kindergarten teacher.

818
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,770
<33-4,RYAN>无前科  没有什么特别的
<33-4,RYAN>No record. There's nothing extraordinary about her.

819
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,660
<33-5,ESPOSITO>除了她父亲的身份
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Except for maybe who her father is.

820
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,580
<33-5,ESPOSITO>根据法庭文件
<33-5,ESPOSITO>According to court documents

821
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,490
<33-5,ESPOSITO>坎迪斯·梅菲尔德的真名是坎迪斯·阿姆斯特朗
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Candice Mayfield's real name is Candice Armstrong--

822
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,790
<33-5,ESPOSITO>罗纳德·阿姆斯特朗的女儿
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Ronald Armstrong's daughter.

823
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,340
<33-6,RYAN>等等  是这个罗纳德·阿姆斯特朗吗
<33-6,RYAN>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This Ronald Armstrong?

824
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,370
<33-6,RYAN>体面之音的创办者  罗纳德·阿姆斯特朗吗
<33-6,RYAN>The founder of Voices for Decency Ronald Armstrong?

825
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,600
<33-7,ESPOSITO>对  是那个想打垮博阿的公司的人
<33-7,ESPOSITO>Mm-hmm. The one who's trying to bring down Beau's company.

826
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,580
<33-7,ESPOSITO>阿姆斯特朗的女儿用了她母亲
<33-7,ESPOSITO>And Armstrong's daughter changed her name

827
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,950
<33-7,ESPOSITO>娘家的姓氏来躲避丑闻
<33-7,ESPOSITO>to her mom's maiden to get away from all the notoriety.

828
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,570
<33-8,BECKETT>不过博阿发现她的真实身份
<33-8,BECKETT>Only Beau found out who she really was.

829
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,610
<33-9,CASTLE>因此博阿引诱她发生关系
<33-9,CASTLE>So Beau lures her into a tawdry encounter,

830
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,540
<33-9,CASTLE>把过程拍下来  并用录像来勒索她
<33-9,CASTLE>films it, and then uses the video to blackmail her.

831
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,650
<33-10,BECKETT>如果她不帮他劝服她父亲
<33-10,BECKETT>And if she didn't agree to get her father off of his back,

832
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,270
<33-10,BECKETT>博阿就将录像公诸于世
<33-10,BECKETT>Beau was going to show the tape.

833
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,170
<33-11,CASTLE>坎迪斯知道一旦录像流出
<33-11,CASTLE>Candice knows that if that tape got out,

834
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,460
<33-11,CASTLE>她的人生就毁了
<33-11,CASTLE>it would ruin her life.

835
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,360
<33-11,CASTLE>这会让她的家族蒙羞
<33-11,CASTLE>It would embarrass her whole family.

836
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,220
<33-11,CASTLE>博阿用录像带把她逼入绝境
<33-11,CASTLE>Beau uses the video to push her into a corner.

837
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,980
<33-11,CASTLE>除了反击  她别无选择
<33-11,CASTLE>She has no choice but to push back.

838
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,310
<34-2,ALEXIS>她就是凶手
<34-2,ALEXIS>She's our killer.

839
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,520
<34-3,CASTLE>你回家做什么呢
<34-3,CASTLE>So what brings you home,

840
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,810
<34-3,CASTLE>除了调制一份巨大无比的甜品之外
<34-3,CASTLE>aside from concocting a ridiculously huge dessert?

841
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,180
<34-3,CASTLE>顺便说一句  我是在夸你哦
<34-3,CASTLE>Kudos, by the way.

842
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,670
<34-4,ALEXIS>我讨厌和你吵架
<34-4,ALEXIS>I hate it when we argue.

843
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,670
<34-5,CASTLE>我也是
<34-5,CASTLE>Me, too.

844
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,250
<34-6,ALEXIS>只是  我都18岁了
<34-6,ALEXIS>It's just, I'm 18.

845
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,990
<34-6,ALEXIS>我无需再事事征询你的同意
<34-6,ALEXIS>I don't have to ask for permission anymore.

846
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,120
<34-6,ALEXIS>不  我理解你
<34-6,ALEXIS>No, I know that.

847
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,330
<34-7,CASTLE>我想让你像我一样体验生活
<34-7,CASTLE>And I want you to experience things the way I did.

848
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,240
<34-7,CASTLE>只是  如今时代不同了
<34-7,CASTLE>It's just, things are different now.

849
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,500
<34-7,CASTLE>这个案子让我明白
<34-7,CASTLE>If this case has taught me anything, it's that...

850
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
<34-7,CASTLE>当你把东西放到网上后
<34-7,CASTLE>when you put something out there,

851
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,520
<34-7,CASTLE>任何人都能看到
<34-7,CASTLE>anyone can see it,

852
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,870
<34-7,CASTLE>不管是面试官还是某个互联网恶人
<34-7,CASTLE>from a future job interviewer to an internet creep.

853
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,560
<34-7,CASTLE>你以为我不知道吗
<34-7,CASTLE>You don't think I know that?

854
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,010
<34-8,ALEXIS>我们这一代生活在数字化环境中
<34-8,ALEXIS>My generation grew up in a digital fish bowl.

855
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,400
<34-8,ALEXIS>无论我们多小心翼翼
<34-8,ALEXIS>And no matter how careful we are,

856
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,080
<34-8,ALEXIS>隐私都会泄露出去
<34-8,ALEXIS>stuff will get out there.

857
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,860
<34-8,ALEXIS>朋友们在相册里圈我
<34-8,ALEXIS>You know, friends will tag me in photos,

858
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,000
<34-8,ALEXIS>难免做出些蠢事
<34-8,ALEXIS>inevitably doing something stupid.

859
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,330
<34-8,ALEXIS>干嘛让那些事定义我
<34-8,ALEXIS>Why should that define me?

860
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,730
<34-8,ALEXIS>干嘛不自己闯一闯  给自己下定义
<34-8,ALEXIS>Why can't I go out there and define myself?

861
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,540
<34-9,CASTLE>不  我能理解  阿丽克西斯
<34-9,CASTLE>No, I get it, Alexis. It's just that I w--

862
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,850
<34-10,ALEXIS>老爸  听着  我懂
<34-10,ALEXIS>Dad, look, I know.

863
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,100
<34-10,ALEXIS>我知道你想保护我  但是...
<34-10,ALEXIS>I know you want to keep me safe, but...

864
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,070
<34-10,ALEXIS>保护我的唯一方法就是给我绑上气泡包装
<34-10,ALEXIS>the only way to do that is wrap me in bubble wrap

865
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,840
<34-10,ALEXIS>藏到洞里
<34-10,ALEXIS>and hide me in a cave.

866
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,600
<34-10,ALEXIS>相信我
<34-10,ALEXIS>Believe me...

867
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,070
<34-11,CASTLE>我考虑过那么做
<34-11,CASTLE>I've thought about it.

868
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,260
<34-11,CASTLE>问题是  阿丽克西斯
<34-11,CASTLE>The thing is, Alexis,

869
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,410
<34-11,CASTLE>外面的世界  坏人做着坏事
<34-11,CASTLE>there are bad people out there who do bad things,

870
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,660
<34-11,CASTLE>你暴露的东西越多
<34-11,CASTLE>and the more you expose...

871
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,230
<34-12,ALEXIS>老爸  你了解我的
<34-12,ALEXIS>Dad, you know me.

872
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,510
<34-12,ALEXIS>我很小心
<34-12,ALEXIS>I'm careful

873
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,740
<34-12,ALEXIS>还很聪明
<34-12,ALEXIS>and smart.

874
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,690
<34-12,ALEXIS>但是  我希望我的生活我做主
<34-12,ALEXIS>But... I need to live my life my way.

875
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,330
<34-12,ALEXIS>好吧
<34-12,ALEXIS>All right.

876
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,940
<34-13,CASTLE>不过这不表示我不再担心
<34-13,CASTLE>But that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop worrying.

877
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,810
<34-13,CASTLE>不表示我不再关心
<34-13,CASTLE>It doesn't mean I'm gonna stop caring or...

878
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,770
<34-13,CASTLE>我还是会不时地提醒你
<34-13,CASTLE>reminding you from time to time

879
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,090
<34-13,CASTLE>你真的  做错了
<34-13,CASTLE>that you are, indeed... wrong.

880
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,930
<34-14,ALEXIS>我希望你担心  关心  提醒
<34-14,ALEXIS>And I wouldn't want you to.

881
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,000
<35-1,CANDICE>我不明白
<35-1,CANDICE>I don't understand.

882
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,600
<35-1,CANDICE>我为什么还要过来
<35-1,CANDICE>Why did I have to come back here?

883
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,740
<35-2,BECKETT>因为你没有告诉我们实情  坎迪斯
<35-2,BECKETT>Because you didn't tell us the whole story, Candice.

884
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,860
<35-2,BECKETT>博阿离开后12秒
<35-2,BECKETT>12 seconds after Beau left,

885
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,670
<35-2,BECKETT>你走向了同一个方向
<35-2,BECKETT>you headed off in the same direction.

886
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,640
<35-3,CANDICE>我没有跟着他
<35-3,CANDICE>Well, I didn't follow him, if that's what you're trying to say.

887
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,740
<35-4,BECKETT>那你去哪了
<35-4,BECKETT>Then where did you go?

888
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,990
<35-5,CANDICE>记不得了  回舞池了
<35-5,CANDICE>I don't remember. Um, back out on the dance floor.

889
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,920
<35-6,BECKETT>坎迪斯  你在撒谎
<35-6,BECKETT>Candice, you're lying.

890
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,950
<35-6,BECKETT>我知道视频的事
<35-6,BECKETT>I know about the video,

891
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,230
<35-6,BECKETT>你跟博阿的视频
<35-6,BECKETT>the one with you and Beau.

892
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,430
<35-7,CANDICE>请你别告诉我父亲
<35-7,CANDICE>Please don't tell my father.

893
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,550
<35-8,BECKETT>我尽量
<35-8,BECKETT>I'm gonna do my best not to.

894
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,960
<35-8,BECKETT>我让步了  你也得有点表示
<35-8,BECKETT>I need you to meet me halfway, though.

895
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,890
<35-8,BECKETT>博阿在勒索你  对不对
<35-8,BECKETT>Beau was blackmailing you, wasn't he?

896
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,310
<35-8,BECKETT>所以你当晚在场
<35-8,BECKETT>That's why you were there last night

897
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,020
<35-8,BECKETT>所以你才杀了他
<35-8,BECKETT>and that's why you killed him.

898
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,300
<35-9,CANDICE>不  你不明白
<35-9,CANDICE>No, you-- you don't understand.

899
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,510
<35-9,CANDICE>我觉得我明白
<35-9,CANDICE>I think I do.

900
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,430
<35-10,BECKETT>你是幼儿园教师
<35-10,BECKETT>You're a kindergarten teacher.

901
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,520
<35-10,BECKETT>你知道那视频会害你丢了饭碗
<35-10,BECKETT>You knew that that video would cost you your job

902
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,530
<35-10,BECKETT>和名誉
<35-10,BECKETT>and your reputation,

903
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,180
<35-10,BECKETT>更不必说你父亲的名誉
<35-10,BECKETT>not to mention your dad's reputation,

904
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,610
<35-10,BECKETT>然后你失控了
<35-10,BECKETT>and you lost control.

905
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,680
<35-10,BECKETT>陪审团会同情你的
<35-10,BECKETT>Any jury's gonna sympathize with you.

906
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,430
<35-10,BECKETT>我也会帮你跟检察官求情
<35-10,BECKETT>And I can put in a good word with the D.A.

907
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:15,420
<35-10,BECKETT>但你要告诉我到底发生了什么
<35-10,BECKETT>I just need you to tell me exactly what happened.

908
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,270
<35-11,CANDICE>我要求跟我的律师谈谈
<35-11,CANDICE>Um, I-I'd like to speak to my attorney.

909
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,500
<36-1,BECKETT>法官批准了搜查令
<36-1,BECKETT>The judge granted us the warrant.

910
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,780
<36-1,BECKETT>弟兄们已经去了坎迪斯家了
<36-1,BECKETT>The boys are on their way to Candice's

911
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,110
<36-1,BECKETT>看看能不能找到
<36-1,BECKETT>to see if they can find proof

912
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,480
<36-1,BECKETT>博阿勒索她的证据
<36-1,BECKETT>that Beau was blackmailing her.

913
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,520
<36-2,CASTLE>很难过吧
<36-2,CASTLE>It's hard, isn't it,

914
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,140
<36-2,CASTLE>比起被害人  凶手竟是品行更好的人
<36-2,CASTLE>when the killer turns out to be a better person than the victim?

915
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,590
<36-4,ARMSTRONG>我女儿在哪里
<36-4,ARMSTRONG>Where's my daughter?

916
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,700
<36-3,RONALD ARMSTRONG>我的律师说你们把她拘留了
<36-3,RONALD ARMSTRONG>My attorney says you're holding her.

917
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,770
<36-4,ARMSTRONG>我要见我女儿
<36-4,ARMSTRONG>I want to talk to my daughter.

918
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,330
<36-5,BECKETT>阿姆斯特朗先生  你应该知道
<36-5,BECKETT>Mr. Armstrong, you should know that Candice

919
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,800
<36-5,BECKETT>坎迪斯是博阿·兰道夫谋杀案的嫌疑人
<36-5,BECKETT>is a person of interest in the Beau Randolph case.

920
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,590
<36-6,ARMSTRONG>什么  别说笑了
<36-6,ARMSTRONG>What? Don't be ridiculous.

921
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,950
<36-7,BECKETT>我们还是私下谈吧
<36-7,BECKETT>We should talk about this privately.

922
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,560
<36-7,BECKETT>请
<36-7,BECKETT>Go ahead.

923
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,110
<36-8,ARMSTRONG>全都是荒谬的误会
<36-8,ARMSTRONG>This is all some kind of hideous mistake.

924
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,770
<36-8,ARMSTRONG>坎迪斯不会伤害任何人的
<36-8,ARMSTRONG>Candice wouldn't hurt anyone.

925
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,560
<36-9,BECKETT>你知道
<36-9,BECKETT>Were you aware of any...

926
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,780
<36-9,BECKETT>她和博阿之间的关系吗
<36-9,BECKETT>connection between her and Beau?

927
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,280
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>跟博阿·兰道夫之间的关系
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>A connection with Beau Randolph?

928
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,250
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>开玩笑吗
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>Are you joking?

929
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,570
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>顺便说一句  我家坎迪斯
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>And by the way, my Candice

930
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,470
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>才不会在夜店被逮个正着
<36-10,ARMSTRONG>would never be caught dead in that club.

931
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,000
<36-11,CASTLE>其实  死了的是博阿[caught dead双关]
<36-11,CASTLE>Actually, it was Beau that was caught dead.

932
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:17,830
<36-11,CASTLE>坎迪斯当时在夜店
<36-11,CASTLE>And Candice was in that club.

933
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,910
<36-12,ARMSTRONG>她在那种地方干什么
<36-12,ARMSTRONG>What on earth was she doing in this place?

934
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,970
<36-13,BECKETT>或许她想保护自己不受博阿骚扰
<36-13,BECKETT>Maybe she was trying to protect herself from Beau.

935
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,240
<36-13,BECKETT>或者保护你
<36-13,BECKETT>Or protect you.

936
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,090
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>我明确表示过不喜欢他
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>I made my feelings about him very plain.

937
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,460
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>我只想终止他的活动
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>My goal was simply to stop his activities.

938
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,930
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>从来没想过让他受到伤害
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>I never intended for him to get hurt.

939
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,500
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>你们觉得我的...
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>Do you think that my, uh...

940
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,360
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>我说的话  我的行为
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>My words, my--my mission...

941
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,770
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>会让坎迪斯做出什么可怕的事情吗
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>could have led Candice to do something terrible?

942
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,470
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>这可能吗
<36-14,ARMSTRONG>Is that possible?

943
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,910
<37-1,RYAN>如果我是坎迪斯  我会那么做
<37-1,RYAN>If I were in Candice's shoes, I would've done the same thing.

944
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,730
<37-2,ESPOSITO>我同情她  真的
<37-2,ESPOSITO>Well, I mean, I feel for her, I do.

945
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,420
<37-2,ESPOSITO>但她知道自己惹上的是什么
<37-2,ESPOSITO>But she knew what she was getting into.

946
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,150
<37-3,RYAN>她知道博阿会勒索她  所以这是她的错吗
<37-3,RYAN>She knew Beau would blackmail her, so this is her fault?

947
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,180
<37-4,ESPOSITO>看看她父亲做的事
<37-4,ESPOSITO>With what her dad did,

948
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,490
<37-4,ESPOSITO>她知道博阿是什么样的人
<37-4,ESPOSITO>she must have known who Beau was

949
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,140
<37-4,ESPOSITO>知道他是干什么的
<37-4,ESPOSITO>and what he was about.

950
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,850
<37-4,ESPOSITO>跟斯嘉丽不一样
<37-4,ESPOSITO>It's not like it was with Scarlet.

951
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,240
<37-5,RYAN>懂了  扯上你自己了  好吧
<37-5,RYAN>Oh, I see. So this is about you. Okay.

952
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,020
<37-6,ESPOSITO>那妞确实没有如实交代  兄弟
<37-6,ESPOSITO>Hey, that chick totally misrepresented herself, bro.

953
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,420
<37-6,ESPOSITO>不过她真辣  对吧
<37-6,ESPOSITO>She was hot, though, right?

954
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,300
<37-7,RYAN>对你来说  可悲的是
<37-7,RYAN>Here's the sad thing-- for you,

955
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,750
<37-7,RYAN>她没有如实供述
<37-7,RYAN>the fact that she misrepresented herself

956
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,670
<37-7,RYAN>在你看来  把她显得更性感
<37-7,RYAN>makes her even hotter.

957
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,440
<37-8,ESPOSITO>不  她已经性感至极了
<37-8,ESPOSITO>No, she can't be any hotter than she already is.

958
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,540
<37-9,RYAN>来看看这个
<37-9,RYAN>Oh, check this out.

959
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,780
<37-10,ESPOSITO>博阿发给坎迪斯的电邮
<37-10,ESPOSITO>Hmm? It is an e-mail to Candice

960
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,190
<37-11,RYAN>还带了附件
<37-11,RYAN>from Beau with an attachment.

961
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,700
<37-12,ESPOSITO>可能是勒索金额
<37-12,ESPOSITO>Probably the terms of the blackmail.

962
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,980
<37-12,ESPOSITO>博阿保守性爱视频的秘密
<37-12,ESPOSITO>What did Beau want in exchange

963
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,350
<37-12,ESPOSITO>是为了交换什么呢
<37-12,ESPOSITO>for keeping a lid on that sex tape?

964
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,720
<37-13,RYAN>不不  这是信托
<37-13,RYAN>No, no, no. This is some kind of trust,

965
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,740
<37-13,RYAN>博阿设了五百万美金
<37-13,RYAN>set up by Beau for $5 million.

966
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,130
<37-14,ESPOSITO>这说不通啊
<37-14,ESPOSITO>Well, that makes no sense.

967
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,290
<37-14,ESPOSITO>如果他在勒索她
<37-14,ESPOSITO>If he was blackmailing her,

968
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,420
<37-14,ESPOSITO>为什么反而给她钱呢
<37-14,ESPOSITO>why would he be giving her money?

969
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,510
<37-15,RYAN>信托不是给坎迪斯的
<37-15,RYAN>The trust isn't for Candice.

970
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,940
<37-15,RYAN>受益人登记的是JD·梅菲尔德
<37-15,RYAN>The beneficiary is listed as a "J.D. Mayfield."

971
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,350
<37-16,ESPOSITO>在她家里没找到叫JD·梅菲尔德的人
<37-16,ESPOSITO>I didn't find a J.D. Mayfield in her family.

972
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,230
<37-17,RYAN>可能是无名氏
<37-17,RYAN>Could be a john doe or a jane doe.

973
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,450
<37-17,RYAN>看看这个
<37-17,RYAN>Yo, check this out.

974
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,820
<37-18,ESPOSITO>坎迪斯的日程表里
<37-18,ESPOSITO>In Candice's date book,

975
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,380
<37-18,ESPOSITO>几天前标了一次超声波检查
<37-18,ESPOSITO>It's an ultrasound dated just a few days ago,

976
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,580
<37-18,ESPOSITO>病人登记的是C. 梅菲尔德
<37-18,ESPOSITO>and the patient is listed as a "C. Mayfield."

977
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,480
<37-19,RYAN>坎迪斯怀孕了
<37-19,RYAN>So Candice is pregnant.

978
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,600
<37-19,RYAN>博阿给她孩子设了信托
<37-19,RYAN>And Beau set up the trust for her baby,

979
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,390
<37-19,RYAN>他为什么要这么做
<37-19,RYAN>and why would he do that?

980
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,040
<37-20,ESPOSITO>因为那也是他的孩子
<37-20,ESPOSITO>Because it's his kid.

981
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,330
<38-1,CANDICE>我在酒吧遇见了博阿
<38-1,CANDICE>I met Beau at a bar.

982
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,270
<38-1,CANDICE>觉得他风趣又可爱
<38-1,CANDICE>I thought he was funny and cute.

983
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,040
<38-1,CANDICE>我不知道他是谁
<38-1,CANDICE>I had no idea who he was.

984
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,110
<38-1,CANDICE>我也很肯定他同样不知道我是谁
<38-1,CANDICE>I'm pretty sure he didn't know who I was, either.

985
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,560
<38-2,CASTLE>时运不佳的一对
<38-2,CASTLE>Star-crossed lovers,

986
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,530
<38-2,CASTLE>就像罗密欧与朱丽叶
<38-2,CASTLE>just like Romeo and Juliet.

987
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,340
<38-3,CANDICE>前提是  罗密欧和朱丽叶喝多了
<38-3,CANDICE>If Romeo and Juliet had gotten drunk

988
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,460
<38-3,CANDICE>还发生了一夜情
<38-3,CANDICE>and had a meaningless one-night stand.

989
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,570
<38-4,CASTLE>有理
<38-4,CASTLE>Point taken.

990
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,340
<38-5,CANDICE>当我发现自己怀孕了
<38-5,CANDICE>When I found out I was pregnant,

991
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,760
<38-5,CANDICE>我意识到告诉他才是正确的做法
<38-5,CANDICE>I knew letting him know was the right thing to do.

992
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,570
<38-5,CANDICE>我觉得他根本不会在意
<38-5,CANDICE>I mean, I figured he wouldn't care,

993
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,940
<38-5,CANDICE>然后告诉我自己去解决
<38-5,CANDICE>that he would tell me I was on my own.

994
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,840
<38-5,CANDICE>即便那样我也会接受
<38-5,CANDICE>And I would've been fine with that.

995
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,070
<38-5,CANDICE>但当我给他看第一张超声波图片时
<38-5,CANDICE>But when I showed him that first ultrasound,

996
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,780
<38-5,CANDICE>他激动得快哭了
<38-5,CANDICE>he got so choked up.

997
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,830
<38-6,BECKETT>这发生在什么时候
<38-6,BECKETT>When was this?

998
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,680
<38-7,CANDICE>两个月前吧
<38-7,CANDICE>About two months ago.

999
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,280
<38-8,CASTLE>那时他和蒂芙尼分了手
<38-8,CASTLE>That's when he broke it off with Tiffany

1000
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
<38-8,CASTLE>并对小青蛙公司产生了兴趣
<38-8,CASTLE>and when he got interested in Little Frog Enterprises.

1001
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,990
<38-8,CASTLE>他准备金盆洗手  走上了正途
<38-8,CASTLE>He was cleaning up his act, going legit.

1002
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,240
<38-8,CASTLE>差不多吧
<38-8,CASTLE>Pretty much.

1003
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,910
<38-9,CANDICE>我以为这一切都是装的
<38-9,CANDICE>I thought it was all an act.

1004
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,770
<38-9,CANDICE>但是他一直打给我
<38-9,CANDICE>But he called all the time.

1005
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,690
<38-9,CANDICE>他说他真的想成为孩子生活的一部分
<38-9,CANDICE>He said he really wanted to be a part of the child's life.

1006
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,870
<38-10,CASTLE>但你知道你爸爸会不同意的
<38-10,CASTLE>But you knew your father would disapprove.

1007
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,070
<38-11,CANDICE>他同意的事情没有几件
<38-11,CANDICE>My father disapproves about most things.

1008
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,710
<38-11,CANDICE>但这次是我
<38-11,CANDICE>It was me.

1009
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,670
<38-11,CANDICE>是我不想要博阿出现的
<38-11,CANDICE>I was the one that didn't want Beau around.

1010
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,980
<38-11,CANDICE>我的意思是  他名声不好
<38-11,CANDICE>I mean, not with his reputation.

1011
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,790
<38-11,CANDICE>我不想连累到我的孩子
<38-11,CANDICE>I didn't want that for my baby.

1012
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,880
<38-11,CANDICE>博阿不愿放弃
<38-11,CANDICE>Beau wouldn't give up.

1013
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,460
<38-11,CANDICE>他告诉我
<38-11,CANDICE>You know, he told me that

1014
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,460
<38-11,CANDICE>他终其一生都在寻找
<38-11,CANDICE>all his life, he'd been searching,

1015
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,570
<38-11,CANDICE>追求人生的意义
<38-11,CANDICE>and he was looking for meaning in his life,

1016
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,370
<38-11,CANDICE>而他最终找到了
<38-11,CANDICE>and that he'd finally found it.

1017
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,570
<38-11,CANDICE>是成为一位父亲
<38-11,CANDICE>It was being a father.

1018
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,670
<38-11,CANDICE>他一直告诉我他会说服我
<38-11,CANDICE>He kept telling me that he would convince me,

1019
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,780
<38-11,CANDICE>他会改的
<38-11,CANDICE>that he could change.

1020
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,710
<38-12,BECKETT>你那晚为什么去酒吧
<38-12,BECKETT>Why'd you go to the club that night?

1021
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,420
<38-13,CANDICE>是博阿让我去的
<38-13,CANDICE>Beau asked me to meet him there.

1022
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,840
<38-13,CANDICE>他想告诉我他关闭了自己的生意
<38-13,CANDICE>He wanted to tell me that he was shutting down his business.

1023
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,810
<38-14,CASTLE>他把生意卖了
<38-14,CASTLE>He was selling it?

1024
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,860
<38-15,CANDICE>不  他把它彻底结束了
<38-15,CANDICE>No, he was shutting it down for good.

1025
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,980
<38-15,CANDICE>他说他知道这是让我相信的唯一方法
<38-15,CANDICE>He said he knew that was the only way to convince me.

1026
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,250
<38-15,CANDICE>所以光盘和网站都消失了
<38-15,CANDICE>So the DVDs, the website, it was all going away.

1027
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,600
<38-16,BECKETT>他有没有告诉过其他人他结束生意的计划
<38-16,BECKETT>Did he tell anyone else that he planned on shutting it down?

1028
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,060
<38-17,CANDICE>是的
<38-17,CANDICE>Yes, he did.

1029
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,010
<38-17,CANDICE>事实上  就在当晚
<38-17,CANDICE>That night, in fact.

1030

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,870
<39-1,TROY>等着工作人员就位
<39-1,TROY>right up here while the crew sets up.

<39-2,CASTLE>节目还要继续对吧  特洛伊
<39-2,CASTLE>Well, the show must go on, right, Troy?

1035
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,640
<39-2,CASTLE>总不能因老板的死
<39-2,CASTLE>Can't let a little thing like the death of your boss

1036
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,800
<39-2,CASTLE>就耽误了狂欢
<39-2,CASTLE>get in the way of a party.

1037
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,750
<39-3,TROY>听着  我想念博阿  他是个好朋友
<39-3,TROY>Look, I miss Beau. He was a good friend.

1038
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,310
<39-3,TROY>但这就是生意
<39-3,TROY>But this is a business.

1039
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,510
<39-3,TROY>我们有片子要拍要卖
<39-3,TROY>Okay, we have videos to produce, distribution deals.

1040
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,150
<39-3,TROY>这不是说完就完的
<39-3,TROY>This doesn't just end.

1041
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,140
<39-3,TROY>我通过让狂欢继续来纪念他
<39-3,TROY>Okay, look, I honor his memory by keeping the party going.

1042
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,280
<39-4,CASTLE>那太好了
<39-4,CASTLE>Oh, that's nice.

1043
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,970
<39-4,CASTLE>但是如果你真想纪念他
<39-4,CASTLE>Except if you really wanted to honor his memory,

1044
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,560
<39-4,CASTLE>就应该关闭所有的经营
<39-4,CASTLE>you would shut down the entire operation.

1045
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,160
<39-5,TROY>关闭
<39-5,TROY>Shut it down?

1046
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,260
<39-6,BECKETT>我们知道博阿告诉你
<39-6,BECKETT>We know that Beau told you

1047
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,100
<39-6,BECKETT>他打算彻底关闭公司
<39-6,BECKETT>he was folding the company for good.

1048
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,370
<39-7,TROY>这太扯了
<39-7,TROY>That's crazy.

1049
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,850
<39-8,BECKETT>是啊  你也或许是这么想的
<39-8,BECKETT>Yeah, and you probably thought so, too.

1050
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,950
<39-8,BECKETT>所以你决定不能让这事发生
<39-8,BECKETT>That's why you decided that you couldn't let it happen.

1051
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,980
<39-9,TROY>你在说什么
<39-9,TROY>What are you talking about?

1052
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,820
<39-10,CASTLE>当我们发现你有犯罪动机时
<39-10,CASTLE>When we found out you had motive,

1053
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,080
<39-10,CASTLE>我们看了你的录影带
<39-10,CASTLE>We took a look at your footage.

1054
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,960
<39-11,TROY>那你就看到我一整晚都在录影
<39-11,TROY>Yeah, and you saw that I was filming all night,

1055
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,690
<39-11,TROY>包括博阿被害的时候
<39-11,TROY>including while Beau was being killed.

1056
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,010
<39-12,CASTLE>其实是你的摄像机在录影
<39-12,CASTLE>Actually, your camera was filming,

1057
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,330
<39-12,CASTLE>而你没有
<39-12,CASTLE>but you weren't.

1058
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,630
<39-13,BECKETT>一般来说手持摄像机的影像
<39-13,BECKETT>Normally the footage from a hand-held camera

1059
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,750
<39-13,BECKETT>是不稳定的
<39-13,BECKETT>would be in motion.

1060
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,900
<39-14,CASTLE>而你的也是不稳定的
<39-14,CASTLE>And yours was in motion,

1061
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,850
<39-14,CASTLE>除了11:50到11:58之间
<39-14,CASTLE>except for from 11:50 to 11:58--

1062
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,700
<39-14,CASTLE>而那时博阿正前往卫生间
<39-14,CASTLE>About the time Beau headed to the bathroom.

1063
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,200
<39-15,BECKETT>在这八分钟里
<39-15,BECKETT>For those eight minutes,

1064
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,890
<39-15,BECKETT>影像却是稳定的
<39-15,BECKETT>The footage was rock-steady.

1065
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,820
<39-16,CASTLE>你把你的摄像机放在了三脚架上
<39-16,CASTLE>You put your camera on a tripod

1066
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,170
<39-16,CASTLE>之后就走开了
<39-16,CASTLE>and you walked away.

1067
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,610
<39-17,BECKETT>你让它继续工作
<39-17,BECKETT>You left it running,

1068
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,730
<39-17,BECKETT>是因为你知道它会给你不在场证明
<39-17,BECKETT>knowing that that would give you an alibi.

1069
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,750
<39-18,TROY>是  我是用三脚架了
<39-18,TROY>I mean, yeah, I used a tripod,

1070
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,310
<39-18,TROY>但这并不能说明我杀了他
<39-18,TROY>but that doesn't prove I killed him.

1071
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,790
<39-19,BECKETT>是  但是凶器上的DNA却可以说明
<39-19,BECKETT>No, but the DNA on the murder weapon will.

1072
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,750
<39-20,TROY>DNA
<39-20,TROY>DNA?

1073
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,530
<39-21,BECKETT>我们拿到了法令对比你的DNA
<39-21,BECKETT>We got a court order to test it against yours.

1074
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,420
<39-22,CASTLE>狂欢结束了  特洛伊
<39-22,CASTLE>Party's over, Troy.

1075
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,590
<39-23,TROY>他答应我会有一天让我接手
<39-23,TROY>He promised me I would take over the business someday,

1076
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,330
<39-23,TROY>答应让我发财
<39-23,TROY>promised he'd get me rich,

1077
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,460
<39-23,TROY>然后他决定结束一切
<39-23,TROY>and then he just decides to end it all,

1078
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,130
<39-23,TROY>决定耍我
<39-23,TROY>decides to screw me over

1079
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,820
<39-23,TROY>就因为什么孩子
<39-23,TROY>because of, uh, what, some baby?

1080
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,100
<39-23,TROY>得了吧
<39-23,TROY>Come on.

1081
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,690
<39-23,TROY>你怎么会放弃这一切
<39-23,TROY>How can you give up all this?

1082
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,170
<39-24,CASTLE>你会找到答案的
<39-24,CASTLE>You're about to find out.

1083
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,390
<39-25,BECKETT>拷上
<39-25,BECKETT>Cuff him.

1084
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,130
<39-25,BECKETT>转过去
<39-25,BECKETT>Turn around.

1085
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,750
<40-1,CANDICE>所以这就是博阿被害的原因
<40-1,CANDICE>So that's why Beau was killed,

1086
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,250
<40-1,CANDICE>因为钱
<40-1,CANDICE>over money?

1087
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,290
<40-2,BECKETT>恐怕是的
<40-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1088
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,450
<40-2,BECKETT>但是你应该知道他没有骗你
<40-2,BECKETT>But you should know that what he told you was the truth.

1089
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,430
<40-3,CASTLE>他真的在成为一个更好的人
<40-3,CASTLE>He really was trying to be a better man.

1090
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,180
<40-4,CANDICE>我只是伤心孩子没有机会见到他
<40-4,CANDICE>I'm just sad that our baby will never get to meet him.

1091
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,920
<40-4,CANDICE>但是总有一天  我会告诉她爸爸的故事
<40-4,CANDICE>But one day, I'll tell her his story--

1092
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,580
<40-4,CANDICE>博阿是如何全兴全意做她父亲的
<40-4,CANDICE>How beau gave his life to be her father.

1093
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,340
<40-5,BECKETT>那你怀得是女孩了
<40-5,BECKETT>So you're having a daughter, then?

1094
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,610
<40-7,BECKETT>是
<40-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

1095
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,980
<40-8,CASTLE>太棒了  恭喜
<40-8,CASTLE>That's wonderful. Congratulations.

1096
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,080
<40-9,CANDICE>谢谢
<40-9,CANDICE>Thank you.

1097
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,690
<40-10,BECKETT>我想你爸来看你了
<40-10,BECKETT>I think your dad's here to see you.

1098
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,300
<40-11,CANDICE>我应该告诉他发生了什么
<40-11,CANDICE>I guess I should tell him what's going on.

1099
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:56,690
<40-11,CANDICE>谢谢你
<40-11,CANDICE>Thank you

1100
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,310
<40-11,CANDICE>找出了真相
<40-11,CANDICE>for finding out the truth.

1101
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,010
<40-12,BECKETT>你觉得他会接受自己的外孙女吗
<40-12,BECKETT>You think he'll be able to accept his grandchild?

1102
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,310
<40-13,CASTLE>一定会的
<40-13,CASTLE>Absolutely.

1103
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,250
<40-14,BECKETT>你怎么那么确定
<40-14,BECKETT>What makes you sure?

1104
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,340
<40-15,CASTLE>因为爸爸可以为女儿做任何事
<40-15,CASTLE>Because a father would do anything for his daughter.
