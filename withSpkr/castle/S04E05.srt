00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,610
<1-6,OWEN>他不在画廊西区

<1-6,OWEN>我去男厕找找
<1-6,OWEN>I'm about to look in the men's room.

<2-3,MARTHA>"卡特·达蒙"会享受短暂的缓刑的
<2-3,MARTHA>"Carter Damon" would appreciate a short reprieve.

23
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,700
<2-4,CASTLE>太迟了  他已经壮烈落水了
<2-4,CASTLE>Too late. He just went kersplat.

<2-4,CASTLE>有什么需要我帮忙的吗
<2-4,CASTLE>Now how can I help you?

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,560
<2-6,CASTLE>届时我会闪人
<2-6,CASTLE>I will make myself scarce.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,620
<2-7,MARTHA>不不不  亲爱的  这个班将会
<2-7,MARTHA>No, no, no. No, no, darling, this class could really benefit

30
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,650
<2-7,MARTHA>从你作家的观点中获益良多
<2-7,MARTHA>from your perspective as a--as a writer.

31
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,630
<2-7,MARTHA>你一定得留在这
<2-7,MARTHA>No, you--you definitely should be here.

32
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,680
<2-8,CASTLE>妈妈  你打什么鬼主意呢
<2-8,CASTLE>Mother, what's going on?

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,960
<2-9,MARTHA>这班里有个可爱的姑娘
<2-9,MARTHA>There's a lovely girl in the class...

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,340
<2-11,MARTHA>-妈妈  -我只是想  也许...
<2-11,MARTHA>- Oh, mother... - And I just thought maybe--

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,150
<2-12,CASTLE>你不是又想给我介绍对象了吧
<2-12,CASTLE>You're not trying to fix me up again.

36
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,650
<2-12,CASTLE>难道你还没从上次的惨败中吸取教训吗
<2-12,CASTLE>Haven't you learned your lesson after the last fiasco?

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,090
<2-13,MARTHA>惨败  你跟她结婚了呀
<2-13,MARTHA>Fiasco? You married her.

38
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,550
<2-14,CASTLE>是的  但婚姻的结果如何呢
<2-14,CASTLE>Yes, and how did that marriage end?

39
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,300
<2-15,MARTHA>宝贝  我只是想帮帮你
<2-15,MARTHA>Honey, I am just trying to help you.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,120
<2-15,MARTHA>你必须承认你的社交生活
<2-15,MARTHA>You have to admit that your social life has been

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,790
<2-15,MARTHA>最近可有点匮乏
<2-15,MARTHA>a bit anemic as of late.

42
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,080
<2-16,CASTLE>现在我想从布鲁克林大桥上跳下去了
<2-16,CASTLE>Now I want to throw myself off the Brooklyn Bridge.

43
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,160
<2-16,CASTLE>亲爱的
<2-16,CASTLE>Oh, darling.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,770
<2-17,MARTHA>近几个月以来  你不是写作
<2-17,MARTHA>All you have been doing for the last few months

45
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,470
<2-17,MARTHA>就是和贝克特一起办案
<2-17,MARTHA>is writing and working with Beckett.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,760
<2-17,MARTHA>现在必须找找对象了
<2-17,MARTHA>Now I think a fix up is in order.

47
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,950
<2-18,CASTLE>除非...
<2-18,CASTLE>Unless...

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,060
<2-18,CASTLE>除非什么
<2-18,CASTLE>Unless?

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,210
<2-19,MARTHA>你已经有不去找对象的理由了
<2-19,MARTHA>You have some reason for not putting yourself out there.

58
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,220
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>在为你的特写镜头做准备吗  卡塞尔
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>Getting ready for your close-up, Castle?

59
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,130
<3-2,CASTLE>不  我只是想领悟它所表达的内在含义
<3-2,CASTLE>No, just trying to discern the hidden meaning.

60
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,490
<3-2,CASTLE>是针对科技兴起
<3-2,CASTLE>Is it about the rise of technology,

61
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,700
<3-2,CASTLE>还是肆虐的自恋
<3-2,CASTLE>rampant narcissism,

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,260
<3-2,CASTLE>又或者只是因为他家电视太多了
<3-2,CASTLE>or did someone just have a lot of extra TVs?

63
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,050
<3-3,BECKETT>有些时候  并不非要明白它的含义
<3-3,BECKETT>Well, sometimes you don't need to know what it's about.

64
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,260
<3-3,BECKETT>有些时候  它就只是... 艺术
<3-3,BECKETT>Sometimes it's just... art.

65
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,170
<3-4,CASTLE>贝克特探长
<3-4,CASTLE>Why, Detective Beckett,

66
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,110
<3-4,CASTLE>你可真是个存在主义者
<3-4,CASTLE>how very existential of you.

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,270
<3-4,CASTLE>让我猜猜  你在大学修了艺术理论课
<3-4,CASTLE>Let me guess. Art theory in college.

68
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,750
<3-5,BECKETT>没  我与艺术课程最近的距离
<3-5,BECKETT>No. The closest I ever came to taking an art class

69
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,430
<3-5,BECKETT>只是在一堂课上做过模特
<3-5,BECKETT>was posing for one as a model.

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,320
<3-6,CASTLE>等等
<3-6,CASTLE>Wait.

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,080
<3-6,CASTLE>是什么造型
<3-6,CASTLE>Posing in?

72
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,310
<3-7,BECKETT>赤裸酮体
<3-7,BECKETT>Not a stitch.

73
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,280
<3-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>来见见布莱恩·海耶斯  三十九岁
<3-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Meet Bryan Hayes, 39.

74
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,900
<3-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>博物馆的常务董事
<3-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Executive Director of the museum.

75
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,030
<3-9,CASTLE>看来有人同时赐予了他自由及死亡
<3-9,CASTLE>Looks like somebody gave him liberty and gave him death.

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,400
<3-10,BECKETT>知道案发时间了吗
<3-10,BECKETT>Any idea when this happened?

77
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,730
<3-11,ESPOSITO>十点时候  最后见到海耶斯的人是默娜·拉姆塞
<3-11,ESPOSITO>Hayes was last seen at 10:00 by a Myrna Ramsey,

78
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,340
<3-11,ESPOSITO>博物馆的业务发展主管
<3-11,ESPOSITO>the museum's Development Director.

79
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,510
<3-11,ESPOSITO>10点21分左右发现他的尸体
<3-11,ESPOSITO>His body was discovered around 10:21.

80
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,850
<3-11,ESPOSITO>所以凶手一定是在这段时间内作的案
<3-11,ESPOSITO>So the killer must have struck sometime within that window.

81
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,900
<3-12,BECKETT>在晚宴期间杀人  胆子还真大
<3-12,BECKETT>Killing him during the gala, that's pretty ballsy.

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,610
<3-13,ESPOSITO>依我看  他是碰巧撞见了
<3-13,ESPOSITO>My money's on he walked in on the other crime

83
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,840
<3-13,ESPOSITO>另一起罪案
<3-13,ESPOSITO>being committed here tonight.

84
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,480
<4-1,MYRNA>它叫做"资本主义之拳"
<4-1,MYRNA>It's called the "Fist of Capitalism."

85
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,390
<4-1,MYRNA>一个针对消费者驱动型文化的震撼控诉
<4-1,MYRNA>A searing indictment of our consumer-driven culture.

86
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,560
<4-2,CASTLE>有人偷了"资本主义之拳"
<4-2,CASTLE>Somebody stole the Fist of Capitalism?

87
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,640
<4-2,CASTLE>有人去查过"社会主义之尻"吗
<4-2,CASTLE>Anyone check up the Ass of Socialism?

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,430
<4-3,BECKETT>那东西值多少钱  拉姆塞女士
<4-3,BECKETT>How much was it worth, Mrs. Ramsey?

89
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,580
<4-4,MYRNA>五千万美元
<4-4,MYRNA>$50 million.

90
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,940
<4-4,MYRNA>光是上面的镶钻就价值三千万
<4-4,MYRNA>The diamonds alone were worth 30.

91
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,850
<4-5,MYRNA>"资本主义之拳"只是暂借给我们展出的
<4-5,MYRNA>The fist was on loan to us.

92
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,800
<4-5,MYRNA>海耶斯先生向所有者保证过展品将被妥善保管
<4-5,MYRNA>Mr. Hayes assured the owners it would be safe.

93
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,940
<4-6,BECKETT>我注意到  你们有装摄像头
<4-6,BECKETT>Y-you know, I notice that you have cameras,

94
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,580
<4-6,BECKETT>这么说这里一定有保安系统
<4-6,BECKETT>so there's obviously a security system.

95
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,940
<4-6,BECKETT>为什么警报没响
<4-6,BECKETT>Why wasn't the alarm triggered?

96
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,460
<4-7,MYRNA>按理说有人踏进这间屋子它就该响起的
<4-7,MYRNA>It should've been, the moment anyone stepped into this room.

97
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,350
<4-7,MYRNA>我的安全小队正在检查没响的原因
<4-7,MYRNA>My security team is trying to determine why it wasn't.

98
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,960
<4-8,BECKETT>好吧  我们需要一份参加晚宴的
<4-8,BECKETT>Okay, well, we'll need a list of all the people

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,990
<4-8,BECKETT>宾客名单
<4-8,BECKETT>who attended the gala

100
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,620
<4-8,BECKETT>以及摄像头的录像
<4-8,BECKETT>along with the videos from the cameras.

101
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,360
<4-9,MYRNA>当然
<4-9,MYRNA>Of course.

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,450
<4-10,BECKETT>我们还得跟发现尸体的人问话
<4-10,BECKETT>We'll also need to talk to whoever found the body.

103
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,030
<5-1,ALYSSA>我真不敢相信
<5-1,ALYSSA>I can't believe this.

104
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,000
<5-1,ALYSSA>这是我一生中最糟的一天
<5-1,ALYSSA>This is the worst day of my life.

105
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,370
<5-2,KEVIN RYAN>你与海耶斯先生很熟吗  艾丽莎
<5-2,KEVIN RYAN>Were you close to Mr. Hayes, Alyssa?

106
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,340
<5-3,ALYSSA>我们一起工作
<5-3,ALYSSA>We worked together.

107
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,420
<5-3,ALYSSA>我帮助他筹备展览
<5-3,ALYSSA>I helped him curate this exhibit.

108
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,740
<5-3,ALYSSA>他是个很可爱的人
<5-3,ALYSSA>He was a lovely man

109
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,450
<5-3,ALYSSA>并且热心支持像我这样年轻艺术家
<5-3,ALYSSA>and very supportive of young artists like me.

110
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,810
<5-4,RYAN>这么说  你是个艺术家啦
<5-4,RYAN>Oh, so you're an artist?

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,340
<5-5,ALYSSA>我在这里工作
<5-5,ALYSSA>This is my day job.

112
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,730
<5-5,ALYSSA>但我热衷艺术
<5-5,ALYSSA>Art is my passion.

113
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,360
<5-5,ALYSSA>海耶斯先生甚至将我的一件雕刻也展出了
<5-5,ALYSSA>Mr. Hayes even put one of my sculptures in the exhibit.

114
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,350
<5-6,RYAN>海耶斯先生有家人吗
<5-6,RYAN>Did Mr. Hayes have any family?

115
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,770
<5-7,ALYSSA>好像他的母亲在爱达荷州
<5-7,ALYSSA>A mother in Idaho, I think.

116
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,640
<5-8,RYAN>那么海耶斯先生
<5-8,RYAN>So Mr. Hayes

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,530
<5-8,RYAN>今晚本该参加宴会的  对吗
<5-8,RYAN>was supposed to work the crowd tonight, right?

118
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,950
<5-8,RYAN>你认为他在这里做什么
<5-8,RYAN>What do you think he was doing over here?

119
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,300
<5-9,ALYSSA>我知道他有点担心"资本主义之拳"
<5-9,ALYSSA>I know he was worried about the "Fist of Capitalism,"

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,290
<5-9,ALYSSA>特别是在晚宴时段
<5-9,ALYSSA>especially with the gala

121
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,030
<5-9,ALYSSA>人山人海  应接不暇的
<5-9,ALYSSA>and the people and all the distractions--

122
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,320
<5-10,RYAN>等等  你说他担心今晚可能会
<5-10,RYAN>Wait. Are you saying that he was worried

123
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,570
<5-10,RYAN>有人把展品偷走吗
<5-10,RYAN>someone might steal the fist?

124
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,970
<5-11,ALYSSA>从展品一到他就忧心忡忡
<5-11,ALYSSA>Ever since it got here.

125
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,160
<5-11,ALYSSA>他甚至回顾了这里前两周的
<5-11,ALYSSA>He even reviewed the security video of the fist,

126
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,120
<5-11,ALYSSA>监控录像
<5-11,ALYSSA>going back two weeks,

127
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,940
<5-11,ALYSSA>就是"资本主义之拳"首展的时候
<5-11,ALYSSA>to when we first put it on display.

128
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,800
<5-11,ALYSSA>之前我认为他太过多疑了
<5-11,ALYSSA>I thought he was being paranoid,

129
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,790
<5-11,ALYSSA>但... 我想他大概听到了什么风声
<5-11,ALYSSA>but... I guess he knew something I didn't.

130
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,960
<5-11,ALYSSA>五千万美元
<5-11,ALYSSA>$50 million?

131
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,710
<6-1,CASTLE>那就是海耶斯不在晚宴上的原因吗
<6-1,CASTLE>That's why Hayes was awol from the gala.

132
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,030
<6-1,CASTLE>他来查看"拳头"了
<6-1,CASTLE>He came to check on the fist.

133
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,670
<6-2,BECKETT>但那时窃贼已经得手  准备离开了
<6-2,BECKETT>But the thief was already on his way out with it...

134
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,160
<6-3,CASTLE>走过这个画廊时
<6-3,CASTLE>Through this gallery,

135
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,910
<6-3,CASTLE>窃贼与海耶斯撞了个正着
<6-3,CASTLE>which put him on a collision course with Hayes.

136
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,820
<6-4,BECKETT>海耶斯与他正面冲突  他们扭打起来
<6-4,BECKETT>So Hayes confronts him, they struggle,

137
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,800
<6-4,BECKETT>然后海耶斯被推倒那些尖刺上
<6-4,BECKETT>and Hayes get pushed into the spikes.

138
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,410
<6-5,CASTLE>就在那一刻  毛贼变成了杀人凶手
<6-5,CASTLE>And at that moment, our thief becomes a killer.

139
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,300
<6-6,BECKETT>一个通过晚宴进入博物馆的杀人凶手
<6-6,BECKETT>A killer who gains access to the museum through the gala.

140
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,130
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>可能性不大
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>That's not likely.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,890
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>所有到场的宾客
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>All arriving guests

142
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,390
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>都经过了两个安全检查点的检查
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>were screened at two security checkpoints

143
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,620
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>然后由认识他们的董事会成员迎接
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>and then greeted by board members who knew them personally.

144
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,950
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>比较可能的情况是  窃贼是由屋顶进入的
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>Odds are the thief came in through the roof--

145
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,700
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>大概是通风口  然后把警报弄坏
<6-7,SERENA KAYE>an air vent probably-- and then disabled the alarms.

146
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,950
<6-8,BECKETT>抱歉  请问你是哪位
<6-8,BECKETT>I'm sorry. Who are you?

147
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,740
<6-9,SERENA>我是萨琳娜·凯耶  博物馆的保险调查员
<6-9,SERENA>I'm Serena Kaye, the museum's insurance investigator.

148
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,560
<6-10,BECKETT>如果窃贼是由通风口入馆
<6-10,BECKETT>So if the thief got in through the vent,

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,770
<6-10,BECKETT>那他是怎么出去的
<6-10,BECKETT>then how did he get out?

150
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,650
<6-10,BECKETT>从卸货区
<6-10,BECKETT>The loading bay.

151
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,750
<6-11,SERENA>保卫把守着每个进口
<6-11,SERENA>The guards there checked everyone entering,

152
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,070
<6-11,SERENA>但他们没有检查出口
<6-11,SERENA>but they didn't check people leaving.

153
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,840
<6-11,SERENA>而且卸货区停满了酒筵公司货车
<6-11,SERENA>Plus, the bay was full of catering vans.

154
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,040
<6-11,SERENA>窃贼可以在那些车子里混入一辆跑路座驾
<6-11,SERENA>He could've had one waiting for him and just blended right in.

155
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,020
<6-12,CASTLE>她挺厉害
<6-12,CASTLE>Oh, she's good.

156
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,990
<6-13,BECKETT>理论而已  但证据呢
<6-13,BECKETT>At theory, but what about proof?

157
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,910
<6-14,SERENA>不用证据我也知道自己是对的
<6-14,SERENA>I don't need proof to know that I'm right.

158
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,820
<6-14,SERENA>这是我的工作
<6-14,SERENA>It's my job, and...

159
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,390
<6-14,SERENA>而且我还能帮帮你们
<6-14,SERENA>I can help you with yours.

160
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,100
<6-15,BECKETT>怎么说
<6-15,BECKETT>How so?

161
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,270
<6-16,SERENA>找回失窃品我能得到相当它价值百分之一的佣金
<6-16,SERENA>I get a 1% finder's fee for recovering stolen objects.

162
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,330
<6-16,SERENA>我要那个"拳头"
<6-16,SERENA>I want that fist.

163
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,970
<6-16,SERENA>你要抓住凶手
<6-16,SERENA>You want your murderer.

164
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,030
<6-16,SERENA>我们的目的一致
<6-16,SERENA>We have common goals.

165
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,550
<6-16,SERENA>我可以提供专业意见  帮你破案
<6-16,SERENA>I could consult on your case and share my insight.

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,110
<6-17,CASTLE>这个主意很有意思
<6-17,CASTLE>You know, that is an intriguing idea.

167
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,800
<6-18,BECKETT>不用  谢谢了  不需要你的帮助
<6-18,BECKETT>No, thank you. That won't be necessary.

168
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,730
<6-19,SERENA>好吧  试试总是没错的
<6-19,SERENA>Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.

169
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,590
<6-19,SERENA>卡塞尔先生  贝克特探长  失陪
<6-19,SERENA>Mr. Castle, Detective Beckett.

170
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,280
<6-20,CASTLE>我们其实用得上她
<6-20,CASTLE>You know, we really could've used her.

171
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,100
<6-20,CASTLE>她挺有料
<6-20,CASTLE>She has valuable assets.

172
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,190
<6-21,CASTLE>不是那个意思
<6-21,CASTLE>Not those kind.

173
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,730
<6-22,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她只会碍事
<6-22,BECKETT>Castle, she'd just get in the way.

174
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,810
<6-22,BECKETT>真的吗
<6-22,BECKETT>Really?

175
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,470
<6-23,CASTLE>万一她真的说对了呢
<6-23,CASTLE>And what if she's on to something?

176
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,980
<6-24,BECKETT>莱恩  你去查查
<6-24,BECKETT>Ryan, check and see

177
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,880
<6-24,BECKETT>是否有可疑的酒筵公司货车
<6-24,BECKETT>if all of the catering vans are accounted for

178
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,750
<6-24,BECKETT>并询问所有酒筵公司员工
<6-24,BECKETT>and interview all the catering staff.

179
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,990
<6-24,BECKETT>看看有没有人在卸货区看到异常情况
<6-24,BECKETT>See if anyone saw anything unusual in the loading bay.

180
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,530
<6-25,CASTLE>这不挺容易的吗
<6-25,CASTLE>Now was that so hard?

181
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,350
<7-1,CASTLE>因为某些未知的原因
<7-1,CASTLE>So for reasons unknown,

182
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,100
<7-1,CASTLE>海耶斯认为有人会去偷"资本主义之拳"
<7-1,CASTLE>Hayes thought someone might swipe the "Fist of Capitalism."

183
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,230
<7-1,CASTLE>我们不知为什么  但他过去查看展品
<7-1,CASTLE>We don't know why, but he goes to check on it

184
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,860
<7-1,CASTLE>却因此丢了性命
<7-1,CASTLE>and ends up paying for it with his life.

185
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,250
<7-2,BECKETT>是啊  但问题在于
<7-2,BECKETT>Yeah, except as it turns out,

186
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,480
<7-2,BECKETT>监控录像并非如此
<7-2,BECKETT>that's not what the security video shows.

187
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,910
<7-3,CASTLE>那是怎么样的
<7-3,CASTLE>What does it show?

188
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,600
<7-4,BECKETT>展品还完好无损地摆在展馆里
<7-4,BECKETT>The fist sitting there, undisturbed in the gallery.

189
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,420
<7-4,BECKETT>盗贼切入了摄像头传输线
<7-4,BECKETT>The thief tapped into the camera lines

190
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,110
<7-4,BECKETT>换成循环播放预先录制的影像
<7-4,BECKETT>and rigged a prerecorded loop.

191
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,940
<7-4,BECKETT>没有指纹
<7-4,BECKETT>There's no prints,

192
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,760
<7-4,BECKETT>但鉴证组发现些痕迹  他们认为是发胶
<7-4,BECKETT>but C.S.U. did find what they think is hair gel.

193
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,340
<7-5,CASTLE>发胶吗  在哪里发现的
<7-5,CASTLE>Hair gel? Where would they find that?

194
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,010
<7-6,BECKETT>在通风管里
<7-6,BECKETT>In the air duct.

195
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,540
<7-7,CASTLE>通风管吗  萨琳娜刚才不是说
<7-7,CASTLE>In the air duct? That's just what Serena--

196
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,010
<7-8,BECKETT>碰巧猜对了而已
<7-8,BECKETT>It's a lucky guess.

197
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,580
<7-9,RYAN>卸货区的事也猜对了
<7-9,RYAN>So was the call on the loading bay.

198
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,580
<7-10,BECKETT>什么意思
<7-10,BECKETT>What do you mean?

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,370
<7-11,RYAN>两个酒筵公司员工记得有辆蓝色雪佛兰货车停在那
<7-11,RYAN>Two of the caterers recall seeing a blue Astro van parked there.

200
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,960
<7-11,RYAN>颜色与酒筵公司货车一样  但没有公司商标
<7-11,RYAN>Same color as the catering vans, but without the company logo.

201
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,020
<7-12,CASTLE>真神哪
<7-12,CASTLE>Imagine that.

202
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,710
<7-13,BECKETT>有人看到货车里的人长什么样吗
<7-13,BECKETT>Did we get a description on anyone in the van?

203
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,270
<7-14,RYAN>没有  但我全境通缉了那辆车
<7-14,RYAN>No, but I put an A.P.B. out on it.

205
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,520
<7-16,RYAN>真好  你又犯什么错了
<7-16,RYAN>Oh, great. What'd you do now?

206
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,310
<7-17,BECKETT>闭嘴吧
<7-17,BECKETT>Shut up.

207
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,690
<7-17,BECKETT>探长
<7-17,BECKETT>Detective,

208
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,280
<8-1,GATES>你肯定见过萨琳娜·凯耶了
<8-1,GATES>I believe you've met Serena Kaye.

209
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,240
<8-2,SERENA>又见面了
<8-2,SERENA>Hello again.

210
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,250
<8-3,BECKETT>你在这里干什么
<8-3,BECKETT>What are you doing here?

211
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,050
<8-4,GATES>凯耶小姐向我提出了
<8-4,GATES>Ms. Kaye has presented me with...

212
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,440
<8-4,GATES>一个非常有说服力的建议
<8-4,GATES>a very compelling proposal.

213
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,110
<8-5,BECKETT>我知道她的建议是什么
<8-5,BECKETT>Yeah, I am familiar with her proposal.

214
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,120
<8-6,GATES>区别是  我喜欢这个建议
<8-6,GATES>Difference is, I like what I heard.

215
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,030
<8-7,BECKETT>-盖茨警监  -她懂专业知识
<8-7,BECKETT>- Captain Gates - She has expertise,

216
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,700
<8-8,GATES>在这件案子上能用得上  可以来做顾问
<8-8,GATES>which she can bring to bear as a consultant on this case.

217
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,720
<8-9,BECKETT>长官  我更希望与我的组员协作
<8-9,BECKETT>Sir, I prefer working with my team.

218
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,900
<8-10,GATES>你的小组里就有个毫无特长的顾问
<8-10,GATES>Which includes a consultant with no expertise at anything.

219
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,050
<8-10,GATES>萨琳娜还能提供有价值的帮助
<8-10,GATES>Serena will be a value add for a change.

220
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,750
<8-11,SERENA>期待与你的合作
<8-11,SERENA>I look forward to working with you.

230
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,990
<9-1,BECKETT>我不得不说
<9-1,BECKETT>Well, I will give you this.

231
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,680
<9-1,BECKETT>你还真是胆大包天
<9-1,BECKETT>You've got some gigantic balls.

232
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,200
<9-2,SERENA>关于窃贼的事  我说对了吗
<9-2,SERENA>What I said about the thief, did I turn out to be right?

233
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,320
<9-3,SERENA>我看重的是结果  探长
<9-3,SERENA>I'm about results, detective.

234
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,720
<9-3,SERENA>这是实现双赢的最佳办法
<9-3,SERENA>This is the best way for both of us to get what we want.

235
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,870
<9-3,SERENA>就当是一次合并
<9-3,SERENA>Think of it as a merger.

236
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,660
<9-4,BECKETT>我看更像是恶意收购
<9-4,BECKETT>More like a hostile takeover.

237
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,000
<9-4,BECKETT>莱恩警探会告诉你案情的进展
<9-4,BECKETT>I'll have Detective Ryan bring you up to speed.

238
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,140
<9-4,BECKETT>他躲过了这几处的监控摄像头
<9-4,BECKETT>He bypassed security cameras here, here, and here.

239
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,840
<10-1,RYAN>然后我们估计
<10-1,RYAN>Then near as we can figure,

240
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,490
<10-1,RYAN>他在卸货区坐一辆蓝色货车逃走了
<10-1,RYAN>he left via the loading bay in a blue van.

241
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,550
<10-2,RYAN>这些...
<10-2,RYAN>And, uh, that's...

242
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,720
<10-2,RYAN>差不多就是我们掌握的信息
<10-2,RYAN>pretty much where we are.

243
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,720
<10-3,CASTLE>那海耶斯看的那段
<10-3,CASTLE>What about the security footage

244
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,930
<10-3,CASTLE>两周前拍摄的监控录像呢
<10-3,CASTLE>that Hayes was looking at from two weeks ago?

245
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,830
<10-3,CASTLE>如果凶手曾去踩过点
<10-3,CASTLE>If the killer had cased out the exhibit,

246
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,850
<10-3,CASTLE>说不定会被拍到
<10-3,CASTLE>maybe he's on that video.

247
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,830
<10-4,RYAN>但是问题在于
<10-4,RYAN>Well-- well, see, that-- that's the problem,

248
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,120
<10-4,RYAN>保安把监控录像
<10-4,RYAN>because security downloads

249
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,020
<10-4,RYAN>下载到U盘中
<10-4,RYAN>all the camera footage into flash drives.

250
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,970
<10-4,RYAN>海耶斯查看了其中一个
<10-4,RYAN>Now Hayes checked out one of the flash drives,

251
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,200
<10-4,RYAN>但现在丢失了
<10-4,RYAN>but now it's missing.

252
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,150
<10-4,RYAN>不在他办公室
<10-4,RYAN>It wasn't in his office,

253
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,500
<10-4,RYAN>也不在尸体上
<10-4,RYAN>and it wasn't on his body, either.

254
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,430
<10-5,CASTLE>也许凶手知道他被拍到  就拿走了
<10-5,CASTLE>Maybe the killer took it because he knew he was on it.

255
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,360
<10-7,SERENA>我们下一步怎么做
<10-7,SERENA>So what's our next move?

256
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,300
<10-8,BECKETT>重案组发来一份名单
<10-8,BECKETT>Major case squad sent in a list

257
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,690
<10-8,BECKETT>上面列出所有可能对"拳头"
<10-8,BECKETT>of all of the fences that might be interested

258
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,950
<10-8,BECKETT>有兴趣的黑市买家
<10-8,BECKETT>in a piece like the fist,

259
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,040
<10-8,BECKETT>我们正在逐一排查
<10-8,BECKETT>and so we are looking into that now.

260
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,900
<10-9,SERENA>现在牵扯到命案  风头浪尖上很难出手
<10-9,SERENA>The fist is too hot to handle now that there's a body on it.

261
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,760
<10-9,SERENA>窃贼可能会单独卖掉钻石
<10-9,SERENA>So the thief may try to fence off the diamonds,

262
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,780
<10-9,SERENA>但肯定不会找你那份名单上的人
<10-9,SERENA>but he won't do business with anyone on that list.

263
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,340
<10-9,SERENA>被警察盯上的人都被淘汰了
<10-9,SERENA>Anyone on it's yesterday's news.

264
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,730
<10-10,BECKETT>你有什么好主意
<10-10,BECKETT>Well, do you have a better idea?

265
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,160
<10-11,ESPOSITO>同志们
<10-11,ESPOSITO>Yo, guys.

266
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,170
<10-11,ESPOSITO>有线索  我在检查监控...
<10-11,ESPOSITO>Found something. I was going over the security--

267
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,270
<10-12,CASTLE>埃斯波西托警探  这位是
<10-12,CASTLE>Detective Esposito, this is

268
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,570
<10-12,CASTLE>萨琳娜·凯耶
<10-12,CASTLE>Serena Kaye.

269
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,010
<10-12,CASTLE>自己人
<10-12,CASTLE>She's with us.

270
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,150
<10-13,ESPOSITO>好吧
<10-13,ESPOSITO>Okay.

271
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,610
<10-13,ESPOSITO>话说回来
<10-13,ESPOSITO>Anyhow,

272
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,880
<10-13,ESPOSITO>我们在监控系统的线路上发现了这个
<10-13,ESPOSITO>we found these clamped to the wires in the security system.

273
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,780
<10-13,ESPOSITO>它的作用差不多就是在警报传到电脑前
<10-13,ESPOSITO>It basically cancels out the alarm signals

274
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,880
<10-13,ESPOSITO>撤销警报
<10-13,ESPOSITO>before they reach the computer.

275
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,200
<10-13,ESPOSITO>被称为感信阻  即...
<10-13,ESPOSITO>It's called an I.S.I. or--

276
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,600
<10-14,SERENA>感应信号阻断器
<10-14,SERENA>An inductive signal interrupter.

277
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
<10-15,SERENA>这个是特制的  我认得它
<10-15,SERENA>This one's custom made. I recognize it.

278
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,800
<10-16,BECKETT>哪里见到的
<10-16,BECKETT>From where?

279
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,330
<10-17,SERENA>在一份关于1992年
<10-17,SERENA>From a report I read

280
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,860
<10-17,SERENA>布鲁塞尔维梅尔画作失窃的报告
<10-17,SERENA>on the 1992 Vermeer theft in Brussels.

282
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,630
<10-17,SERENA>那个盗贼还用这个装置偷了许多画
<10-17,SERENA>The same thief used these to steal a dozen other paintings.

283
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,330
<10-17,SERENA>这是他的作案特征  我知道是谁了
<10-17,SERENA>These are his signature. I know who took the fist.

284
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,620
<10-17,SERENA>是法鲁克
<10-17,SERENA>It's Falco.

285
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,690
<10-18,BECKETT>然后呢  他没有姓吗
<10-18,BECKETT>Falco what? Does he have a last name?

286
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,160
<10-19,SERENA>没人知道  他从没被抓到过
<10-19,SERENA>No one knows. He's never been caught.

287
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,490
<10-19,SERENA>甚至没人拍下过他的样子
<10-19,SERENA>He's never even been photographed.

288
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,210
<10-19,SERENA>他是欧洲顶级的艺术品盗贼
<10-19,SERENA>He's a top art thief in Europe,

289
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,230
<10-19,SERENA>不过他很多年没犯过案了
<10-19,SERENA>though he hasn't worked in years.

290
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,690
<10-19,SERENA>传言是  他金盆洗手了
<10-19,SERENA>Rumor was, he'd gotten out of the game.

291
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,750
<10-20,CASTLE>五千万足以引他重出江湖
<10-20,CASTLE>Well, nothing like $50 million to pull you out of retirement.

292
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,650
<10-21,SERENA>现在有了调查方向  我能找到些线索
<10-21,SERENA>Now that we have some direction, I can get us some leads.

293
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,310
<10-22,BECKETT>-很好  我们走  -你不能去
<10-22,BECKETT>- Great. Let's go. - You can't come.

294
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,980
<10-23,SERENA>不好意思  你是不是对"顾问"一词理解有误
<10-23,SERENA>I'm sorry. You might have misunderstood the word "consultant."

295
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,830
<10-24,BECKETT>这是我的案子
<10-24,BECKETT>This is my case.

296
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
<10-25,SERENA>那里的人不会对警察开口
<10-25,SERENA>The people there won't talk to cops,

297
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,200
<10-25,SERENA>但会跟我说
<10-25,SERENA>but they'll talk to me.

298
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,720
<10-26,BECKETT>你要去哪
<10-26,BECKETT>Where are you going?

299
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,890
<10-27,CASTLE>我也不是警察
<10-27,CASTLE>Uh, I'm not a cop, either...

300
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,010
<10-28,CASTLE>那么...
<10-28,CASTLE>So...

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,490
<10-29,BECKETT>随便你
<10-29,BECKETT>Fine.

302
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,940
<10-30,ESPOSITO>自己人
<10-30,ESPOSITO>She's with us?

303
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,060
<10-31,BECKETT>去联系国际刑警
<10-31,BECKETT>Let's get ahold of interpol.

304
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,020
<10-31,BECKETT>尽可能全面地挖掘法鲁克的资料
<10-31,BECKETT>I want to find out everything we can about Falco.

305
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,050
<11-1,SERENA>你是个很有趣的人  卡塞尔先生
<11-1,SERENA>You're an interesting man, Mr. Castle.

306
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,110
<11-1,SERENA>白天是罪恶终结者  晚上是侦探小说家
<11-1,SERENA>Crime fighter by day, mystery writer by night.

307
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,410
<11-2,CASTLE>你也是很有趣的人
<11-2,CASTLE>You're pretty interesting yourself.

308
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,090
<11-2,CASTLE>我们要见一个秘密线人吗
<11-2,CASTLE>So are we meeting a secret informant?

309
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,960
<11-3,SERENA>我猜贝克特不是因为你长得俊才留你在身边
<11-3,SERENA>I guess Beckett doesn't just keep you around for your good looks.

310
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,570
<11-4,SERENA>这里恶名昭彰  但也便于隐藏身份
<11-4,SERENA>This place is as infamous as it is anonymous.

311
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,380
<11-4,SERENA>萨琳娜
<11-4,SERENA>Serena.

312
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,910
<11-5,FINN>怎么这么久都不联系  你不再爱我了吗
<11-5,FINN>Why you been such a stranger? You don't love me no more?

313
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,730
<11-6,SERENA>文  我最近太忙了
<11-6,SERENA>Oh, Vin. I've been busy.

314
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,570
<11-7,FINN>忙着干啥  跟这种小白脸一起吗
<11-7,FINN>Busy with what, Jason Bateman over here?

315
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,080
<11-8,CASTLE>我有次就靠这张脸逃了张超速罚单呢
<11-8,CASTLE>Hey, that got me out of a speeding ticket once.

316
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,910
<11-9,SERENA>文  这次时间不多
<11-9,SERENA>Hey, Vin. This is time sensitive.

317
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,100
<11-9,SERENA>我们改天再闲谈
<11-9,SERENA>We can play catch-up later.

318
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,530
<11-9,SERENA>眼下  我想知道有没有人出手顶级钻石
<11-9,SERENA>Right now I need to know if anyone's moving D flawless diamonds,

319
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,340
<11-9,SERENA>数量不少
<11-9,SERENA>a lot of them.

320
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,670
<11-10,FINN>什么时间
<11-10,FINN>Time frame?

321
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,570
<11-11,SERENA>最早应该是昨晚
<11-11,SERENA>They might have hit the market as early as last night.

322
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,860
<11-12,FINN>那些钻石怎么样
<11-12,FINN>These babies hot?

323
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,220
<11-13,CASTLE>就像超新星一样闪亮
<11-13,CASTLE>Like a supernova.

324
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,410
<11-14,FINN>无能为力
<11-14,FINN>Can't help you.

325
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,750
<11-14,FINN>其实
<11-14,FINN>Well...

326
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,480
<11-15,FINN>几天前
<11-15,FINN>You know, there was-- there was a guy

327
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,350
<11-15,FINN>有一个家伙来找过我
<11-15,FINN>who came my way a few days ago,

328
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,710
<11-15,FINN>很谨慎的样子
<11-15,FINN>was real cagey-like.

329
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,260
<11-15,FINN>试探我对一件艺术品是否有兴趣
<11-15,FINN>Tried to take my temp on a piece of art

330
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,550
<11-15,FINN>据说是镶满了顶级钻石
<11-15,FINN>covered with a crapload of Flawless D's.

331
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,440
<11-17,FINN>就是大理石手一类的东西
<11-17,FINN>Yeah, some sort of marble hand or something.

332
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,170
<11-18,SERENA>这个人长什么样子
<11-18,SERENA>This guy, what did he look like?

333
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,850
<12-1,ESPOSITO>萨琳娜说的没错  法鲁克是个狠角色
<12-1,ESPOSITO>Serena was right. Falco's a badass.

334
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,580
<12-1,ESPOSITO>看这厚厚一叠国际刑警组织的案卷
<12-1,ESPOSITO>Look how fat his Interpol file is.

335
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,770
<12-2,ESPOSITO>他96年在普希金博物馆偷了件雷诺的作品
<12-2,ESPOSITO>He lifted a Renoir from the Pushkin in '96

336
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,400
<12-2,ESPOSITO>99年是莫奈的作品
<12-2,ESPOSITO>and a Monet in '99,

337
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,290
<12-2,ESPOSITO>一直用感应信号阻断器
<12-2,ESPOSITO>always using an I.S.I.

338
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,360
<12-3,BECKETT>看上去法鲁克以前没杀过人
<12-3,BECKETT>Doesn't look like Falco's killed anybody before.

339
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,060
<12-4,ESPOSITO>凡事都有第一次
<12-4,ESPOSITO>First time for everything, I guess.

340
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,690
<12-5,BECKETT>尤其海耶斯挡在了五千万美元的财路上
<12-5,BECKETT>Yeah, especially when Hayes stood between him and $50 million.

341
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,680
<12-6,ESPOSITO>不过据国际刑警称
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Though according to interpol,

342
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,300
<12-6,ESPOSITO>法鲁克并不为自己干活
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Falco doesn't steal for himself.

343
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,180
<12-6,ESPOSITO>更倾向于替人卖命
<12-6,ESPOSITO>He's more of a gun for hire.

344
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,300
<12-6,ESPOSITO>有人想要毕加索的作品  他就为他们搞到手
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Someone wants a Picasso, he boosts it for 'em.

345
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,140
<12-7,BECKETT>这就给我们找凶手提供了第二条路
<12-7,BECKETT>Which gives us a second path to our killer.

346
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,720
<12-7,BECKETT>如果我们找不到法鲁克
<12-7,BECKETT>If we can't find Falco,

347
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,180
<12-7,BECKETT>那就先找雇他偷东西的人
<12-7,BECKETT>then we look for whoever hired him to steal the fist.

348
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,620
<12-8,JOY MCHUGH>我知道谁雇的他
<12-8,JOY MCHUGH>I'll tell you who hired him.

349
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,290
<12-8,JOY MCHUGH>安东·麦克休  我的混蛋丈夫
<12-8,JOY MCHUGH>Anton McHugh, my son-of-a-bitch husband.

350
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,000
<13-1,JOY>"拳头"是我和安东共同拥有的
<13-1,JOY>The fist belongs to me and Anton.

351
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,530
<13-1,JOY>我们把它借给博物馆以供展出
<13-1,JOY>We loaned it to the museum from our collection.

352
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,430
<13-2,BECKETT>你丈夫为什么要偷它
<13-2,BECKETT>Why would your husband steal it?

353
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,380
<13-3,JOY>为了打击我
<13-3,JOY>To screw me over.

354
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,780
<13-4,ESPOSITO>好吧  可你说那东西是他的
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Right, but you said that he owns it.

355
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,390
<13-5,JOY>一半是他的
<13-5,JOY>He owns half of it.

356
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,530
<13-6,BECKETT>你们在申请离婚
<13-6,BECKETT>You were going through a divorce.

357
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,340
<13-7,JOY>我们只是摆门面罢了
<13-7,JOY>Oh, we keep up appearances,

358
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,990
<13-7,JOY>主要是因为没人愿意放弃
<13-7,JOY>mostly because neither of us will give up

359
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,230
<13-7,JOY>第五大道那间公寓
<13-7,JOY>the Fifth Avenue apartment.

360
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,840
<13-7,JOY>但是这个
<13-7,JOY>But this?

361
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,190
<13-7,JOY>这次安东更下一层楼
<13-7,JOY>This time, Anton has hit a new low.

362
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,110
<13-8,BECKETT>就是说你们在争夺"拳头"
<13-8,BECKETT>So then you're fighting over the fist.

363
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,840
<13-9,JOY>我认为它应该留在博物馆里
<13-9,JOY>I think it should stay in the museum.

364
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,590
<13-9,JOY>这是件艺术品
<13-9,JOY>It's a work of art.

365
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,050
<13-9,JOY>应该让大家来欣赏
<13-9,JOY>It should be enjoyed by the public.

366
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,070
<13-10,ESPOSITO>是的  但你丈夫不买账
<13-10,ESPOSITO>Right, but your husband's not on board.

367
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,380
<13-11,JOY>说"不买账"未免有些轻描淡写
<13-11,JOY>There's an understatement.

368
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,900
<13-11,JOY>上次我们和离婚律师见面时
<13-11,JOY>At our last meeting with the divorce attorneys,

369
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,510
<13-11,JOY>他叫嚣着要不择手段
<13-11,JOY>he screamed at me that he would

370
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,550
<13-11,JOY>把"拳头"抢回去
<13-11,JOY>get the fist back by any means necessary.

371
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,680
<13-12,BECKETT>但他这么说
<13-12,BECKETT>Yeah, but saying that he wanted the fist back

372
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,140
<13-12,BECKETT>并不代表他会雇人去偷吧
<13-12,BECKETT>doesn't necessarily mean that he hired someone to steal it.

373
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,670
<13-13,JOY>能
<13-13,JOY>Yes, it does,

374
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,020
<13-13,JOY>因为他之前试图偷过
<13-13,JOY>because he's tried to steal it before.

375
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,510
<14-1,BECKETT>麦克休先生  两周前"资本主义之拳"
<14-1,BECKETT>Mr. McHugh, a curious incident happened two weeks ago

376
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,810
<14-1,BECKETT>在去博物馆途中发生了有趣的事件
<14-1,BECKETT>when the "Fist of Capitalism" was on its way to the museum.

377
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,230
<14-1,BECKETT>两个自称来自搬家公司的人
<14-1,BECKETT>Two men claiming to be from the moving company

378
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,470
<14-1,BECKETT>试图抢走它
<14-1,BECKETT>tried to intercept it.

379
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,650
<14-2,ANTON MCHUGH>据我所知  那是场误会
<14-2,ANTON MCHUGH>My understanding is, that was a bit of a mixup.

380
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,800
<14-3,BECKETT>尽管没有提出指控
<14-3,BECKETT>Now there were no charges filed,

381
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,130
<14-3,BECKETT>但两人都有丰厚的案底
<14-3,BECKETT>but both men had long criminal histories.

382
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,870
<14-4,ANTON>我和这事没关系
<14-4,ANTON>I had nothing to do with this.

383
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,560
<14-4,ANTON>从来没和他们联系过
<14-4,ANTON>Never even so much as made contact with them.

384
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,020
<14-5,RYAN>有趣的是  你的离婚律师联系过他们
<14-5,RYAN>But interestingly, your divorce lawyer did.

385
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,210
<14-5,RYAN>就在这场误会前给他们打了数通电话
<14-5,RYAN>Made lots of phone calls to the men right before this mixup.

386
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,410
<14-6,BECKETT>法鲁克在哪
<14-6,BECKETT>Where's Falco?

387
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,740
<14-7,ANTON>谁
<14-7,ANTON>Who?

388
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,440
<14-8,BECKETT>你第一次试图偷窃"拳头"失败后
<14-8,BECKETT>After your first failed attempt to steal the fist,

389
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,650
<14-8,BECKETT>你决定雇个专业点的小偷
<14-8,BECKETT>You decided to hire a better class of thief.

390
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,640
<14-8,BECKETT>不幸的是  他杀了布莱恩·海耶斯
<14-8,BECKETT>Unfortunately, he ended up killing Bryan Hayes in the process.

391
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,420
<14-9,RYAN>你就成了谋杀从犯
<14-9,RYAN>Which makes you an accessory to murder.

392
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,480
<14-9,RYAN>你说什么
<14-9,RYAN>What?

393
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,580
<14-10,ANTON>你疯了吧
<14-10,ANTON>You're out of your mind.

394
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,500
<14-10,ANTON>等一下
<14-10,ANTON>Wait a second.

395
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,280
<14-10,ANTON>肯定是乔伊在作祟
<14-10,ANTON>I'll bet Joy is behind this.

396
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,980
<14-11,BECKETT>相信我  麦克休先生
<14-11,BECKETT>Trust me, Mr. McHugh,

397
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,310
<14-11,BECKETT>如果你不告诉我们法鲁克的下落
<14-11,BECKETT>your divorce is gonna be the least of your problems

398
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,060
<14-11,BECKETT>你该担心的就不是离婚的事了
<14-11,BECKETT>if you don't tell us where Falco is.

399
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,720
<14-12,ANTON>我从没听说过法鲁克这人
<14-12,ANTON>I never heard of any Falco,

400
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
<14-12,ANTON>而且我也没拿那"拳头"  好吗
<14-12,ANTON>And I didn't take the fist, all right?

401
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,860
<14-12,ANTON>事实是  我压根不想要那东西
<14-12,ANTON>The truth is, I didn't even want the damn thing.

402
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,320
<14-12,ANTON>我只是想乔伊这么以为而已
<14-12,ANTON>I just wanted Joy to think I wanted it.

403
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,200
<14-13,BECKETT>这又是为什么
<14-13,BECKETT>And why is that?

404
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,140
<14-14,ANTON>我想如果乔伊认为我在乎它
<14-14,ANTON>I thought if I made Joy think it meant something to me,

405
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,180
<14-14,ANTON>她会把纳帕的葡萄园给我
<14-14,ANTON>She'd give me the vineyard in Napa.

406
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,750
<14-15,ANTON>现在这也没了
<14-15,ANTON>Now that it's gone...

407
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,660
<14-15,ANTON>那个肉毒老巫婆要把我洗劫一空了
<14-15,ANTON>That bag of botox is gonna clean me out.

408
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,990
<15-1,RYAN>你怎么看
<15-1,RYAN>So what do you think?

409
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,430
<15-1,RYAN>你相信他说的话吗
<15-1,RYAN>You believe him?

410
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,060
<15-2,BECKETT>不管怎样  我们都没有足够的证据
<15-2,BECKETT>Well, e-either way, we don't have enough

411
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,620
<15-2,BECKETT>发传票查麦克休家的财务状况
<15-2,BECKETT>to subpoena the McHughs' financials to, uh--

412
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,410
<15-3,SERENA>法鲁克看起来不像在为麦克休干活
<15-3,SERENA>Doesn't look like Falco is working with McHugh.

413
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,700
<15-4,BECKETT>那会是谁
<15-4,BECKETT>Well, who was he working with?

414
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,100
<15-5,CASTLE>博物馆的董事  布莱恩·海耶斯
<15-5,CASTLE>The museum's director-- Bryan Hayes.

415
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,100
<15-6,BECKETT>死者吗
<15-6,BECKETT>Our victim?

416
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,010
<15-7,CASTLE>几天前一个符合海耶斯长相的男人
<15-7,CASTLE>A man matching Hayes' description met with

417
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,550
<15-7,CASTLE>和萨琳娜的线人接触过
<15-7,CASTLE>Serena's contact a few days ago,

418
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,110
<15-7,CASTLE>打听有关顶级钻石的事
<15-7,CASTLE>asking about D Flawless diamonds.

419
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,880
<15-8,RYAN>所以海耶斯也有份吗
<15-8,RYAN>So Hayes was in on the theft?

420
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,690
<15-8,RYAN>一定是他雇的法鲁克去偷"拳头"
<15-8,RYAN>He must have hired Falco to steal the fist.

421
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,240
<15-9,CASTLE>只是法鲁克想独吞了它
<15-9,CASTLE>Yeah, only Falco decided to keep it.

422
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,300
<15-10,SERENA>所以他把海耶斯给杀害了
<15-10,SERENA>So he murdered Hayes.

423
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,960
<15-11,BECKETT>如果海耶斯是同谋
<15-11,BECKETT>If Hayes was a coconspirator,

424
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
<15-11,BECKETT>那或许能助我们找到法鲁克
<15-11,BECKETT>that might lead us to Falco.

425
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,660
<15-11,BECKETT>查一下他的财务状况
<15-11,BECKETT>Let's take a look at his, um, financials--

426
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,770
<15-12,RYAN>-那些惯例  -没错
<15-12,RYAN>- The usual.  - Yeah.

427
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,350
<15-14,RYAN>我去问下我的其他线人
<15-14,RYAN>I'll work some of my other sources,

428
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,510
<15-15,SERENA>看看是否能找到有关他的线索
<15-15,SERENA>see if we can get a line on him.

429
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,980
<15-16,CASTLE>又要去探访曼哈顿的穷街陋巷吗
<15-16,CASTLE>Oh, another jaunt into Manhattan's seedy underbelly?

430
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,700
<15-16,CASTLE>算我一个
<15-16,CASTLE>Count me in.

431
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,220
<15-17,SERENA>抱歉  这次不用找人帮忙
<15-17,SERENA>Mm. Sorry. No need for a guy Friday on this one.

432
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,240
<15-17,SERENA>我只是去打电话  没什么意思
<15-17,SERENA>I'll just be making phone calls, boring stuff.

433
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,220
<15-17,SERENA>我稍后给你电话
<15-17,SERENA>But I'll catch you later?

434
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,140
<15-18,CASTLE>随时恭候
<15-18,CASTLE>Catch me anytime.

435
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,440
<15-18,CASTLE>凯特
<15-18,CASTLE>Kate...

436
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,970
<15-18,CASTLE>是嘛
<15-18,CASTLE>Rreally?

437
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,920
<16-1,MARTHA>保险调查员吗
<16-1,MARTHA>An insurance investigator?

438
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,290
<16-2,CASTLE>性感的保险调查员
<16-2,CASTLE>A sexy insurance investigator.

439
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,600
<16-2,CASTLE>她为我的下一本书塑造了很好的人物形象
<16-2,CASTLE>I think she'd make a great character for my next book.

440
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,370
<16-3,MARTHA>你看起来对她很有好感
<16-3,MARTHA>Well, you seem rather taken with her.

441
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,410
<16-4,CASTLE>我觉得她
<16-4,CASTLE>I find her...

442
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,420
<16-4,CASTLE>很赞
<16-4,CASTLE>impressive.

443
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,070
<16-5,MARTHA>她什么样
<16-5,MARTHA>What's she like?

444
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,800
<17-1,BECKETT>她是个不合作又自大  顽固的万事通
<17-1,BECKETT>She's an uncooperative, cocky, stubborn know-it-all.

445
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,340
<17-2,DR CARTER BURKE>但她确实挺厉害  是吗
<17-2,DR CARTER BURKE>But she is good at her job?

446
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,980
<17-3,BECKETT>至少卡塞尔这么认为
<17-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, Castle seems to think so.

447
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,880
<17-4,BURKE>而这令你困扰
<17-4,BURKE>And that bothers you.

448
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,080
<17-5,BECKETT>这当然困扰我
<17-5,BECKETT>Yes, of course it bothers me.

449
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,550
<17-6,BURKE>为什么
<17-6,BURKE>Why?

450
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,100
<17-7,BECKETT>因为他应该
<17-7,BECKETT>Because he's supposed to be...

451
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,830
<17-8,BURKE>应该怎样
<17-8,BURKE>Be what?

452
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,040
<17-9,BECKETT>是我的搭档
<17-9,BECKETT>My partner.

453
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,130
<17-9,BECKETT>他应该和我站一边
<17-9,BECKETT>I mean, he's supposed to be on my team.

454
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,880
<17-9,BECKETT>而不是神魂颠倒的
<17-9,BECKETT>He's not supposed to be all smitten.

455
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,790
<18-1,CASTLE>神魂颠倒
<18-1,CASTLE>Smitten?

456
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,480
<18-1,CASTLE>妈妈  我觉得说感兴趣更好
<18-1,CASTLE>Mother, I think "intrigued" is a better word.

457
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,860
<18-2,MARTHA>那你打算怎么做
<18-2,MARTHA>So what's our next move?

458
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,840
<18-3,CASTLE>做什么
<18-3,CASTLE>Move?

459
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,720
<18-4,MARTHA>理查德  真是的
<18-4,MARTHA>Oh, Richard, honestly.

460
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,200
<18-4,MARTHA>贝克特表明了她不想谈恋爱
<18-4,MARTHA>Beckett has made it plain that she's not available

461
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,840
<18-4,MARTHA>至少现在不想
<18-4,MARTHA>for now.

462
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,370
<18-4,MARTHA>而你遇到了这个女人
<18-4,MARTHA>And now you've met this woman.

463
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,240
<18-4,MARTHA>她聪明  有魅力
<18-4,MARTHA>She's smart, she's incredibly attractive,

464
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,360
<18-4,MARTHA>你又对她感兴趣
<18-4,MARTHA>You're intrigued by her.

465
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,720
<18-4,MARTHA>为什么不约她出来呢
<18-4,MARTHA>Why not ask her out?

466
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,110
<18-5,CASTLE>这很复杂
<18-5,CASTLE>It's complicated.

467
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,060
<19-1,BURKE>为什么复杂
<19-1,BURKE>Why is it complicated?

468
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,840
<19-2,BECKETT>你知道为什么
<19-2,BECKETT>You know why it's complicated.

469
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,440
<19-3,BURKE>我只知道你告诉我的部分
<19-3,BURKE>Only what you've told me.

470
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,440
<19-3,BURKE>凯特
<19-3,BURKE>Kate...

471
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,470
<19-3,BURKE>你到底在怕什么
<19-3,BURKE>What are you really scared of...

472
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,410
<19-3,BURKE>是怕他不会等你
<19-3,BURKE>That he won't wait for you

473
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,910
<19-3,BURKE>还是怕他会一直等你
<19-3,BURKE>or that he will?

474
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,010
<20-2,BECKETT>我以为你和萨琳娜在一起呢
<20-2,BECKETT>Hey. I figured that you were with Serena.

475
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,070
<20-3,CASTLE>没  她今早要和老板们开会
<20-3,CASTLE>No. She had a meeting with her bosses this morning.

476
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,330
<20-4,BECKETT>那你们今早见过面了
<20-4,BECKETT>Oh. So you already saw her this morning.

477
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,850
<20-5,CASTLE>没有  她给我发短信来着
<20-5,CASTLE>No. She texted me. Oh.

478
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,930
<20-5,CASTLE>你以为我们...
<20-5,CASTLE>You thought that we were--

479
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,800
<20-6,BECKETT>是啊  很明显
<20-6,BECKETT>Yeah. I mean, you know, it's pretty obvious

480
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,970
<20-6,BECKETT>她对你有意  所以...
<20-6,BECKETT>that she really likes you, so...

481
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,620
<20-7,CASTLE>是吗
<20-7,CASTLE>It is?

482
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,340
<20-8,BECKETT>那么你觉得我该...
<20-8,BECKETT>So then you think i should...

483
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,050
<20-9,CASTLE>追她吗
<20-9,CASTLE>pursue it?

484
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,920
<20-10,BECKETT>这个你随意
<20-10,BECKETT>You know, I mean, suit yourself.

485
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,280
<20-11,ESPOSITO>窃贼逃跑用的货车
<20-11,ESPOSITO>That, uh, getaway van the thief used?

486
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,930
<20-11,ESPOSITO>被弃在皇后区的一个小巷子里
<20-11,ESPOSITO>It was dumped in an alley in Queens.

487
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:52,580
<20-12,BECKETT>车上有指纹吗
<20-12,BECKETT>Any prints?

488
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,820
<20-13,ESPOSITO>没有  都擦掉了  非常专业
<20-13,ESPOSITO>Nope. Wiped clean. Very professional.

489
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,780
<20-13,ESPOSITO>但鉴证组在靠枕上发现了那种发胶
<20-13,ESPOSITO>But CSU did find traces of that hair gel on the headrest.

490
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,190
<20-13,ESPOSITO>他们在查制造商
<20-13,ESPOSITO>They're trying to ID the manufacturer.

491
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,800
<20-14,RYAN>贝克特  我这里有海耶斯的消息
<20-14,RYAN>Hey, Beckett, I got that stuff on Hayes.

492
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,020
<20-14,RYAN>这家伙去年花了大把钞票
<20-14,RYAN>Well, during the past year, the guy has shelled out

493
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,950
<20-14,RYAN>为他母亲的长期护理买单
<20-14,RYAN>some major cash to pay for his mother's long-term care bills.

494
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
<20-14,RYAN>他在经济上入不敷出
<20-14,RYAN>Financially, the man was deep underwater.

495
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,210
<20-15,CASTLE>他可能觉得只有"拳头"能带他脱离苦海
<20-15,CASTLE>He probably thought the fist was his only solution.

496
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,710
<20-16,RYAN>我们还在他的电脑里发现了一些可疑的邮件
<20-16,RYAN>We also found some suspicious e-mails on his laptop.

497
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,960
<20-16,RYAN>讨论关于博物馆安全系统的问题
<20-16,RYAN>Stuff about the museum's security system.

498
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,240
<20-16,RYAN>追踪过去是个匿名用户
<20-16,RYAN>Tech traced them to an anonymous account.

499
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,890
<20-17,CASTLE>法鲁克知道如何销声匿迹
<20-17,CASTLE>Falco knows how to cover his tracks.

500
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,950
<20-18,RYAN>其中一封邮件提到窃案发生前一日碰头的事
<20-18,RYAN>One of them mentions a meeting the day before the heist.

501
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,350
<20-19,BECKETT>也就是说如果我们能查到他们的会面地点
<20-19,BECKETT>So if we can figure out where they met,

502
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,260
<20-19,BECKETT>就有可能知道法鲁克的身份了
<20-19,BECKETT>it might lead us to Falco's identity.

503
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,310
<20-20,RYAN>我猜会面时间是在
<20-20,RYAN>I'm guessing it took place

504
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,500
<20-20,RYAN>中午12点到下午2点之间
<20-20,RYAN>some time between 12:00 and 2:00 p.m.

505
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,190
<20-20,RYAN>因为海耶斯只有这个时候离开了博物馆
<20-20,RYAN>since that's the only time Hayes left the museum.

506
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,100
<20-21,ESPOSITO>等一下  我这里有他当天的通话记录
<20-21,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. I got something on his phone records for that day.

507
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,750
<20-21,ESPOSITO>上午11点06分  他往阿斯卡纳餐厅
<20-21,ESPOSITO>11:06 a.m. He made a one-minute phone call

508
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,250
<20-21,ESPOSITO>打过一通一分钟的电话
<20-21,ESPOSITO>to Ascana's restaurant.

509
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,690
<20-22,CASTLE>他在订位
<20-22,CASTLE>He was making reservations.

510
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,420
<20-22,CASTLE>我打赌是订两个人的位子
<20-22,CASTLE>How much you want to bet it was for two--

511
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,140
<20-22,CASTLE>他和法鲁克
<20-22,CASTLE>Him and Falco?

512
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,640
<21-1,HOSTESS>我记得海耶斯先生
<21-1,HOSTESS>Sure. I remember Mr. Hayes.

513
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,000
<21-1,HOSTESS>三天前  他们坐在角落的小包间
<21-1,HOSTESS>Three days ago. They sat in a corner booth.

514
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,440
<21-2,BECKETT>他不是一个人  对吧
<21-2,BECKETT>So he was here with someone?

515
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,510
<21-3,HOSTESS>没错
<21-3,HOSTESS>Definitely.

516
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,970
<21-3,HOSTESS>他俩当时讨论得热火朝天
<21-3,HOSTESS>The two of them were having a real intense conversation.

517
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,380
<21-4,BECKETT>你记得这个人的长相吗
<21-4,BECKETT>Do you remember what this person looked like?

518
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,590
<21-5,HOSTESS>她身材高挑
<21-5,HOSTESS>Uh, she was tall,

519
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,860
<21-5,HOSTESS>金发
<21-5,HOSTESS>blonde,

520
00:19:59,130 --> 00:19:59,950
<21-5,HOSTESS>美丽动人
<21-5,HOSTESS>gorgeous.

521
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,320
<21-6,BECKETT>等等  和海耶斯一起的是个女人
<21-6,BECKETT>Wait. Hayes was here with a woman?

522
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,190
<21-7,HOSTESS>是的  她有三十多岁  但依旧风姿不减
<21-7,HOSTESS>That's right. She was in her 30's, but still really hot.

523
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,290
<21-8,CASTLE>等一下
<21-8,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

524
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,250
<21-8,CASTLE>她是不是像...
<21-8,CASTLE>Did she look like...

525
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,150
<21-9,HOSTESS>这样
<21-9,HOSTESS>this?

526
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,660
<21-9,HOSTESS>对  就是她
<21-9,HOSTESS>Yeah. That's her.

527
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,820
<21-10,BECKETT>是萨琳娜
<21-10,BECKETT>It's Serena.

528
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,990
<21-11,BECKETT>她就是我们找的大盗
<21-11,BECKETT>She's our thief.

529
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,380
<22-1,RYAN>不不  谢谢你
<22-1,RYAN>No, no. Thank you.

530
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,150
<22-2,RYAN>刚和保险公司核实过
<22-2,RYAN>Hey. Just got off with the insurance company.

531
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,140
<22-2,RYAN>你们猜萨琳娜在他们那里上班前是做什么的
<22-2,RYAN>Guess what Serena did before she worked for them.

532
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,420
<22-3,CASTLE>幼儿园老师
<22-3,CASTLE>Kindergarten teacher?

533
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,210
<22-4,ESPOSITO>艺术品窃贼
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Art thief.

534
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,360
<22-5,RYAN>未被确认的艺术品窃贼
<22-5,RYAN>Alleged art thief.

535
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,910
<22-6,ESPOSITO>随便吧
<22-6,ESPOSITO>Whatever.

536
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,090
<22-7,RYAN>是01到06年几桩大案的重要嫌犯
<22-7,RYAN>Suspected of pulling off some major jobs between '01 and '06--

537
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,590
<22-7,RYAN>在普拉多  乌菲茨  休斯顿博物馆
<22-7,RYAN>Prado, Uffizi, Houston--

538
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,650
<22-7,RYAN>但他们都抓不到她的把柄
<22-7,RYAN>But they could never pin anything on her.

539
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,970
<22-8,BECKETT>那她是怎么和保险挂上钩的
<22-8,BECKETT>Well, how the hell did she end up working insurance?

540
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,860
<22-9,ESPOSITO>大约五年前
<22-9,ESPOSITO>About five years ago,

541
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,620
<22-9,ESPOSITO>她去公司应聘  说是要洗心革面
<22-9,ESPOSITO>she went to the company and said she wanted to make good.

542
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,900
<22-9,ESPOSITO>还给他们指出了保安的漏洞
<22-9,ESPOSITO>Even told 'em where they were going wrong with their security.

543
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,170
<22-10,BECKETT>让我猜猜看  她建议大家齐心协力
<22-10,BECKETT>Let me guess. She suggested that they all work together.

544
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,500
<22-11,CASTLE>至少她始终如一嘛
<22-11,CASTLE>Well, at least she's consistent.

545
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,720
<22-12,BECKETT>而且念旧  看来她是使出老伎俩了
<22-12,BECKETT>And nostalgic. Looks like she's back to her old tricks again.

546
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,520
<22-13,RYAN>只不过她加了一招  谋杀
<22-13,RYAN>Only now she's added a new one--murder.

547
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,600
<22-14,BECKETT>所以她才对窃贼如何进入博物馆了若指掌
<22-14,BECKETT>That's why she knew how the thief got into the museum.

548
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,770
<22-14,BECKETT>她就是窃贼本尊
<22-14,BECKETT>She was the thief.

549
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,230
<22-15,ESPOSITO>然后她跑来跟我们合作  误导我们
<22-15,ESPOSITO>And then she partnered up with us to steer us

550
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,340
<22-15,ESPOSITO>去追查那个虚构的法鲁克
<22-15,ESPOSITO>to the mythical Falco.

551
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,410
<22-16,CASTLE>我被她耍了
<22-16,CASTLE>She played me.

552
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,190
<22-17,BECKETT>别担心  卡塞尔
<22-17,BECKETT>Don't worry, Castle.

553
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,360
<22-17,BECKETT>你不是唯一一个被耍的
<22-17,BECKETT>You're not the only one.

554
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,030
<22-18,GATES>她参与其中是吗
<22-18,GATES>She's in on it?

555
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,480
<22-19,BECKETT>我们还不能完全确定  长官
<22-19,BECKETT>Uh, we're not exactly sure, sir,

556
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,010
<22-19,BECKETT>但证据显示
<22-19,BECKETT>But the evidence suggests--

557
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,420
<22-20,GATES>把她缉拿归案  探长  立刻去
<22-20,GATES>I want her in custody, detective, now.

558
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,810
<22-21,BECKETT>我们不能直接证明她有罪
<22-21,BECKETT>Our case is circumstantial.

559
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,250
<22-22,GATES>那就去找确凿证据
<22-22,GATES>Get something concrete.

560
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,460
<22-22,GATES>警局被当众羞辱这种事决不能发生
<22-22,GATES>I will not have this department publicly humiliated.

561
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,760
<22-23,BECKETT>是  长官
<22-23,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

562
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,250
<22-24,BECKETT>她现在在哪
<22-24,BECKETT>So where is she now?

563
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,860
<22-25,CASTLE>在酒店
<22-25,CASTLE>At her hotel.

564
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,420
<22-26,CASTLE>-她邀请我去喝酒  -是吗
<22-26,CASTLE>- She invited me for a drink. - Did she?

565
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,290
<22-27,ESPOSITO>看来她不急于逃之夭夭啊
<22-27,ESPOSITO>Doesn't look like she's in a rush to leave town.

566
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,670
<22-28,CASTLE>那我们得利用好这个优势
<22-28,CASTLE>Well, then we press our one advantage.

567
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,290
<22-29,BECKETT>她还不知道我们盯上她了
<22-29,BECKETT>She doesn't know we're on to her,

568
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,170
<22-29,BECKETT>我们要不知不觉查出她的底细
<22-29,BECKETT>so we make a run at her without her finding out.

569
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,380
<22-30,RYAN>要怎么做呢
<22-30,RYAN>And how are we gonna do that?

570
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,280
<22-31,BECKETT>简单
<22-31,BECKETT>Simple.

571
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,450
<23-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔约她出来
<23-1,BECKETT>Castle asks her out on a date.

572
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,050
<23-2,CASTLE>我吗
<23-2,CASTLE>I do?

573
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,870
<23-3,BECKETT>这不是如你所愿了吗
<23-3,BECKETT>It's what you wanted, isn't it?

574
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,810
<23-3,BECKETT>你只需让她离开房间
<23-3,BECKETT>All you have to do is keep her out of her room...

575
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,370
<23-3,BECKETT>和她在酒店的餐厅进餐
<23-3,BECKETT>and take her to the restaurant at the hotel.

576
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,530
<23-3,BECKETT>然后
<23-3,BECKETT>Then...

577
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,960
<23-4,BECKETT>共度美好时光就行了
<23-4,BECKETT>just show her a good time.

578
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,270
<23-4,BECKETT>谢谢
<23-4,BECKETT>Thank you.

579
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,610
<23-4,BECKETT>你拖住她的期间
<23-4,BECKETT>And while you keep her occupied...

580
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,680
<23-4,BECKETT>我们进入她的房间
<23-4,BECKETT>we get into her room.

581
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,160
<23-5,CASTLE>约会上我要做些什么
<23-5,CASTLE>So what am I doing on this date?

582
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,190
<23-5,CASTLE>我是不是要
<23-5,CASTLE>Am I trying to...

583
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,890
<23-5,CASTLE>套她的话  让她从实招来什么的
<23-5,CASTLE>trip her up, get her to break?

584
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,210
<23-6,BECKETT>不用  就拖住她  讲几个笑话
<23-6,BECKETT>No, just stall her-- make some jokes,

585
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,810
<23-6,BECKETT>闲扯呗
<23-6,BECKETT>you know, small talk.

586
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,230
<23-6,BECKETT>重点是让她别着急回房间
<23-6,BECKETT>The important thing is to keep her out of her hotel room

587
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,600
<23-6,BECKETT>给我们搜寻的时间
<23-6,BECKETT>so we can search it.

588
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,250
<23-7,BECKETT>怎么样  卡塞尔
<23-7,BECKETT>So what do you say, Castle?

589
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,120
<23-7,BECKETT>你的魅力够拖她一个小时吗
<23-7,BECKETT>Think you can charm her for an hour?

590
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,700
<24-1,CASTLE>你是认真的吗
<24-1,CASTLE>Are you serious?

591
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,890
<24-2,SERENA>是的
<24-2,SERENA>Absolutely.

592
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,520
<24-2,SERENA>我本来打算再等一天
<24-2,SERENA>I was gonna give you one more day.

593
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,010
<24-3,CASTLE>然后你就会主动约我出去了
<24-3,CASTLE>And then you were gonna ask me out yourself?

594
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,150
<24-3,CASTLE>是的
<24-3,CASTLE>Mm-hmm.

595
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,730
<24-4,SERENA>我是个懂得争取自己所好的女人
<24-4,SERENA>Well, I'm a woman who believes in going after what she wants.

596
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,870
<24-5,CASTLE>看出来了
<24-5,CASTLE>I can see that.

597
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,530
<24-6,SERENA>而且  我喜欢你  这点我毫无掩饰
<24-6,SERENA>Besides, I hardly made it a secret that I was attracted to you,

598
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,430
<24-6,SERENA>我也能看出你对我的感觉也是一样的
<24-6,SERENA>and I could tell you felt the same way about me.

599
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,190
<24-7,CASTLE>看来我们都不是遮遮掩掩的人啊
<24-7,CASTLE>Well, looks like neither one of us are very good at keeping secrets.

600
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,580
<25-1,ESPOSITO>我这边没发现
<25-1,ESPOSITO>Nothin' so far.

601
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,150
<25-1,ESPOSITO>你呢
<25-1,ESPOSITO>You find anything?

602
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,700
<25-2,BECKETT>没
<25-2,BECKETT>No.

603
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,110
<25-3,ESPOSITO>你特别想抓住这小妞儿  对吧
<25-3,ESPOSITO>Hmm. You really want to nail this chick, don't you?

604
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,280
<25-3,ESPOSITO>这个嘛
<25-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well,

605
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,290
<25-4,BECKETT>我们的本职工作就是如此啊  缉拿罪犯
<25-4,BECKETT>it's what we do, isn't it, catch bad guys?

606
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,390
<25-5,ESPOSITO>那倒是  但...
<25-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but...

607
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,700
<25-5,ESPOSITO>这次好像不单纯是这样
<25-5,ESPOSITO>seems like it might be about more than that.

608
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,260
<25-6,BECKETT>继续找  好吗
<25-6,BECKETT>Just keep lookin', okay?

609
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,700
<26-1,CASTLE>你为什么要当保险调查员呢
<26-1,CASTLE>So why choose to be an insurance investigator?

610
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,340
<26-1,CASTLE>这很明显不是那种小女孩们
<26-1,CASTLE>It's really not something most little girls

611
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,820
<26-1,CASTLE>梦想拥有的职业
<26-1,CASTLE>aspire to be when they grow up.

612
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,790
<26-2,SERENA>我是最近才转行的
<26-2,SERENA>It's a recent career change.

613
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,940
<26-2,SERENA>真的吗
<26-2,SERENA>Really?

614
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,430
<26-3,CASTLE>那你以前是做什么的
<26-3,CASTLE>What did you do before?

615
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,110
<26-4,SERENA>其实我是个贼
<26-4,SERENA>Actually, I was a thief.

616
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,480
<26-5,CASTLE>别逗了
<26-5,CASTLE>Get out.

617
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,030
<26-6,SERENA>是博物馆那边非要这样叫
<26-6,SERENA>Well, that's what the museums like to call me.

618
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,670
<26-6,SERENA>我更倾向于称之为"艺术寻回人"
<26-6,SERENA>I prefer to think of myself as an art retriever.

619
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,040
<26-7,CASTLE>有什么区别吗
<26-7,CASTLE>What's the difference?

620
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,480
<26-8,SERENA>我所获取的艺术品都是从
<26-8,SERENA>Well, the pieces I took had already been stolen

621
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,090
<26-10,SERENA>原主人那里掠夺走的
<26-10,SERENA>from their rightful owners--

622
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,670
<26-7,CASTLE>被纳粹  暴君  政府之类强取豪夺
<26-7,CASTLE>Taken by nazis, despots, governments.

623
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,130
<26-8,SERENA>艺术品在博物馆展出
<26-8,SERENA>Just because a piece is in a museum

624
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,690
<26-8,SERENA>不代表艺术品就属于那里
<26-8,SERENA>doesn't mean it belongs there.

625
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,410
<26-9,CASTLE>你不是开玩笑吧
<26-9,CASTLE>Seriously?

626
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,620
<26-10,SERENA>我专门负责将艺术品归还给真正的主人
<26-10,SERENA>I specialized in returning art to their rightful owners,

627
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,280
<26-10,SERENA>最早是从一名党卫军手中
<26-10,SERENA>starting with a small Rembrandt

628
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,350
<26-10,SERENA>夺回他从我爷爷那夺走的伦布兰特画作
<26-10,SERENA>an S.S. Officer took from my grandfather.

629
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,880
<26-11,CASTLE>所以你有点类似
<26-11,CASTLE>So you were kinda like the, uh,

630
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,210
<26-11,CASTLE>女性版的印第安纳·琼斯
<26-11,CASTLE>Female Indiana Jones,

631
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,590
<26-11,CASTLE>只是你没带牛仔帽和鞭子
<26-11,CASTLE>only without the hat and whip.

632
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,750
<26-12,SERENA>只是没戴帽子而已
<26-12,SERENA>Well, without the hat.

633
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,030
<26-13,CASTLE>好热
<26-13,CASTLE>It's gettin' hot in here.

634
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,260
<27-1,SERENA>我有个主意
<27-1,SERENA>I have an idea.

635
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,560
<27-1,SERENA>我们别吃甜点了  如何
<27-1,SERENA>Why don't we skip dessert?

636
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,980
<27-2,CASTLE>我们急什么呢
<27-2,CASTLE>Oh, well... What's the rush?

637
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,720
<27-2,CASTLE>我听说这里的草莓松饼相当不错
<27-2,CASTLE>I hear the strawberry shortcake here is excellent.

638
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,930
<27-3,SERENA>你难道不想到我房间
<27-3,SERENA>Wouldn't you rather come up to my room

639
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,070
<27-3,SERENA>喝一杯吗
<27-3,SERENA>for a drink?

640
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,350
<27-4,CASTLE>据说那草莓非常的新鲜
<27-4,CASTLE>The, uh, strawberries are supposed to be really fresh.

641
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,250
<27-5,SERENA>好吧
<27-5,SERENA>Well, great.

642
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,940
<27-5,SERENA>客房服务就点它们
<27-5,SERENA>We can order them from room service...

643
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,220
<27-5,SERENA>还有浓浓的鲜奶油
<27-5,SERENA>with extra whip cream.

645
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,200
<27-5,SERENA>我找到了些东西
<27-5,SERENA>I think I found something.

647
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,870
<28-1,BECKETT>是萨琳娜和一些销赃犯之间的信息
<28-1,BECKETT>It's a message between Serena and a bunch of fences.

648
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,940
<28-1,BECKETT>猜猜是谁想脱手一批顶级钻石
<28-1,BECKETT>Guess who's trying to sell d flawless diamonds.

649
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,710
<28-2,ESPOSITO>我也找到了些东西
<28-2,ESPOSITO>I think I found something, too--

650
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,400
<28-2,ESPOSITO>作案的工具
<28-2,ESPOSITO>The tools of the trade...

651
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,830
<28-2,ESPOSITO>还有一个感应信号阻断器
<28-2,ESPOSITO>As well as an I.S.I.

652
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,080
<28-2,ESPOSITO>到了
<28-2,ESPOSITO>There it is.

654
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,200
<29-1,SERENA>天际套房
<29-1,SERENA>The skyline suite.

655
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,070
<29-2,BECKETT>你们在这儿干什么
<29-2,BECKETT>What--what are you doing here?

656
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,820
<29-3,SERENA>以偷窃和谋杀的罪名
<29-3,SERENA>Arresting you for theft...

657
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,800
<29-4,BECKETT>逮捕你
<29-4,BECKETT>and murder.

658
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,670
<29-4,BECKETT>等等  你是说
<29-4,BECKETT>Wait. So now you're telling me

659
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,470
<30-1,BECKETT>你认为不是她干的吗
<30-1,BECKETT>that you don't believe she's in on this?

660
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,930
<30-2,CASTLE>她为什么要告诉我她是小偷呢
<30-2,CASTLE>Why would she tell me she's a thief?

661
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,880
<30-2,CASTLE>为什么要坦白
<30-2,CASTLE>Why offer that up?

662
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,720
<30-3,BECKETT>她想先给你点甜头
<30-3,BECKETT>Because she's feeding you just enough truth

663
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,810
<30-3,BECKETT>好让你接受她撒下的弥天大谎
<30-3,BECKETT>so that swallowing the lies is easier.

664
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,090
<30-4,CASTLE>我觉得不是她干的
<30-4,CASTLE>I don't think she's behind this.

665
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,910
<30-5,BECKETT>你根本没用大脑在思考
<30-5,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you're thinking with the wrong body part.

666
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,420
<30-6,CASTLE>只是接个吻而已
<30-6,CASTLE>It was only a kiss.

667
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,890
<30-6,CASTLE>是你要我这么做的  拖住她
<30-6,CASTLE>I was doing what you told me to, keeping her occupied.

668
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,330
<30-6,CASTLE>我是在帮你们拖时间
<30-6,CASTLE>I was trying to give you enough time

669
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,600
<30-6,CASTLE>好让你们搜查她的房间
<30-6,CASTLE>so that you could search her room.

670
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,750
<30-7,BECKETT>没错  房间  我们从房间里找出了
<30-7,BECKETT>Yes, the room-- the room where we found

671
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,370
<30-7,BECKETT>手提箱和那些邮件
<30-7,BECKETT>the suitcase and the e-mail,

672
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,590
<30-7,BECKETT>这些都是对她不利的证据
<30-7,BECKETT>which all stands as evidence against her right now.

673
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,460
<30-8,CASTLE>我只是觉得我们该听她解释一下
<30-8,CASTLE>I just think we should give her a chance to explain.

674
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,470
<30-9,BECKETT>我们吗  不  你休想
<30-9,BECKETT>We? No, there is no way

675
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,340
<30-9,BECKETT>跟我一起审讯她
<30-9,BECKETT>we're going in on the interrogation together.

676
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,550
<30-9,BECKETT>别这样
<30-9,BECKETT>Oh, come on.

677
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,250
<30-10,BECKETT>抱歉了  卡塞尔  可现在
<30-10,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Castle, but right now,

678
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,950
<30-10,BECKETT>基于这段对话和你在酒店的举动
<30-10,BECKETT>based on this conversation and your behavior in that hotel,

679
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,420
<30-10,BECKETT>你明显是在偏袒她
<30-10,BECKETT>it is obvious that you have been compromised.

680
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,650
<30-11,CASTLE>我只是照着
<30-11,CASTLE>I was only doing...

681
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,180
<30-12,CASTLE>你说的在做
<30-12,CASTLE>what you asked.

682
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,740
<31-1,CASTLE>这次我就不出席了
<31-1,CASTLE>I thought I'd sit this one out.

683
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,220
<31-2,BECKETT>我不得不说
<31-2,BECKETT>I gotta hand it to you.

684
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,430
<31-2,BECKETT>你设计的这一长线骗局
<31-2,BECKETT>this whole long con you've got going...

685
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,070
<31-2,BECKETT>令人惊叹
<31-2,BECKETT>It's impressive.

686
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,000
<32-1,BECKETT>向保险公司示好
<32-1,BECKETT>Cozying up to insurance companies,

687
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,030
<32-1,BECKETT>告诉他们你想改过自新
<32-1,BECKETT>telling them that you want to go straight,

688
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,320
<32-1,BECKETT>同时又在等待下一个目标
<32-1,BECKETT>all the while waiting for your next score.

689
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,710
<32-2,SERENA>你在说什么
<32-2,SERENA>What are you talking about?

690
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,290
<32-3,BECKETT>唯一的麻烦是  你知道你需要海耶斯
<32-3,BECKETT>The only catch was that you knew you needed Hayes

691
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,220
<32-3,BECKETT>可如果让他活下去
<32-3,BECKETT>but you knew you couldn't get away with it

692
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,110
<32-3,BECKETT>你就无法脱身
<32-3,BECKETT>if you let him live,

693
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,900
<32-3,BECKETT>于是你潜入我的调查
<32-3,BECKETT>so you insinuated yourself into my investigation

694
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,500
<32-3,BECKETT>来掩盖你的痕迹
<32-3,BECKETT>to cover your tracks.

695
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,480
<32-4,SERENA>我本以为里克才是你们组里爱编故事的那个
<32-4,SERENA>And here I thought Rick was the only writer on your team.

696
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,070
<33-1,RYAN>里克吗  你俩进展到可以互称名字了吗
<33-1,RYAN>Rick? You guys on a first-name basis now?

697
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,230
<33-1,RYAN>那个
<33-1,RYAN>Well...

698
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,330
<33-2,ESPOSITO>他在酒店走廊上和她亲热来着
<33-2,ESPOSITO>He was making out with her in the hotel hallway.

699
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,100
<33-3,CASTLE>贝克特叫我拖住她
<33-3,CASTLE>Beckett told me to stall her.

700
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,720
<33-4,ESPOSITO>她叫你用舌头去拖吗
<33-4,ESPOSITO>She also tell you to use tongue?

701
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,990
<33-5,BECKETT>我不需要编故事
<33-5,BECKETT>I don't need to spin stories.

702
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,040
<33-5,BECKETT>我知道你在抢劫的前一天
<33-5,BECKETT>I've got you meeting Bryan Hayes

703
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,950
<33-5,BECKETT>和布莱恩·海耶斯碰了面
<33-5,BECKETT>the day before the heist.

704
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,730
<33-6,SERENA>没错  为了确认晚宴时的安保情况
<33-6,SERENA>Yes, to go over security for the gala.

705
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,470
<33-6,SERENA>他很担心
<33-6,SERENA>He was concerned.

706
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,260
<33-7,BECKETT>担心吗
<33-7,BECKETT>Concerned?

707
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,350
<33-7,BECKETT>他参与了劫案
<33-7,BECKETT>He was involved.

708
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,510
<34-1,SERENA>当时我并不知道这一切都是他在做戏
<34-1,SERENA>I didn't know that it was all an act at the time.

709
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,950
<34-2,BECKETT>如果那次碰面光明正大
<34-2,BECKETT>If that meeting was so innocent,

710
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,660
<34-2,BECKETT>你之前为什么不告诉我们呢
<34-2,BECKETT>then why didn't you tell us about it before?

711
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,990
<34-3,SERENA>被他那样耍得团团转
<34-3,SERENA>Because it's not like I'm particularly proud of the fact

712
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,540
<34-3,SERENA>也不是什么值得骄傲的事
<34-3,SERENA>that I didn't figure out what he was up to.

713
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,380
<34-3,SERENA>要是我识破了他  那雕塑不会被偷走
<34-3,SERENA>If I had, then the sculpture wouldn't be stolen,

714
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,640
<34-3,SERENA>而他或许还活着
<34-3,SERENA>and he might still be alive.

715
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,070
<35-1,RYAN>天  她的"盗亦有道"
<35-1,RYAN>Man, she's really selling the whole

716
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,760
<35-1,RYAN>还真是装得有模有样啊
<35-1,RYAN>"thief with a heart of gold" act.

717
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,560
<35-2,CASTLE>也许这不是假装
<35-2,CASTLE>Maybe it's not an act.

718
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,880
<35-3,ESPOSITO>她看起来相当镇定
<35-3,ESPOSITO>She is being really calm in there.

719
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,570
<35-4,RYAN>没错  不可思议地镇定
<35-4,RYAN>Yeah, like strangely calm.

720
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,050
<35-4,RYAN>也许真不是她干的
<35-4,RYAN>Maybe she didn't do it.

721
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,240
<35-4,RYAN>不然她就是个疯子  这样的话
<35-4,RYAN>Either that or she's a psychopath, in which case...

722
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,670
<35-4,RYAN>你还真会挑人啊
<35-4,RYAN>you sure can pick 'em.

723
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,410
<35-5,BECKETT>我们找到了你用来闯入
<35-5,BECKETT>We found the tools that you used

724
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:13,600
<35-5,BECKETT>博物馆的工具
<35-5,BECKETT>to break in to the museum--

725
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,170
<35-5,BECKETT>绳索  挂钩
<35-5,BECKETT>The rope, grappling hook,

726
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,000
<35-5,BECKETT>开锁工具
<35-5,BECKETT>lock picks.

727
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,400
<35-6,SERENA>我专门从事物归原主的工作
<35-6,SERENA>I specialize in recovery.

728
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,920
<35-6,SERENA>保险公司不在乎我是如何
<35-6,SERENA>The insurance companies don't care how

729
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,930
<35-6,SERENA>找回这些东西的  只要能找回
<35-6,SERENA>I get the pieces back, just that I do.

730
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,770
<35-7,BECKETT>所以从根本上说  你还是个贼
<35-7,BECKETT>So basically, you're still a thief.

731
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,520
<35-8,SERENA>物归原主  不算偷
<35-8,SERENA>Recovery, not theft.

732
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,810
<35-9,BECKETT>在黑市倒卖顶级钻石
<35-9,BECKETT>And what part of recovery involves trying to sell

733
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,130
<35-9,BECKETT>算哪门子物归原主啊
<35-9,BECKETT>D flawless diamonds on the black market?

734
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,840
<35-10,SERENA>法鲁克有可能要卖掉钻石
<35-10,SERENA>Falco may try to move those stones.

735
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,200
<35-10,SERENA>我是想要赶走他的潜在销赃犯
<35-10,SERENA>I was trying to flush out his possible fences.

736
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,560
<35-10,SERENA>我了解你的底细  探长
<35-10,SERENA>Listen, I've done my homework on you, detective.

737
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,480
<35-10,SERENA>我知道你是个聪明  有条理性
<35-10,SERENA>I know that you're a smart, methodical cop

738
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,740
<35-10,SERENA>直觉又准的警察
<35-10,SERENA>with great instincts.

739
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,900
<35-10,SERENA>你的直觉在告诉你
<35-10,SERENA>And those instincts are telling you right now

740
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,360
<35-10,SERENA>我是清白的
<35-10,SERENA>that I'm innocent.

741
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:43,840
<35-10,SERENA>基于某些原因  你对它们视而不见
<35-10,SERENA>For some reason, you're ignoring them.

742
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,080
<35-11,BECKETT>为什么呢
<35-11,BECKETT>Why is that?

743
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,510
<35-11,BECKETT>凯耶女士  你说你的工作是物归原主
<35-11,BECKETT>Ms. Kaye, your job is recovery, as you call it.

744
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,080
<35-11,BECKETT>我的工作则是解决凶案
<35-11,BECKETT>my job is to solve this homicide.

745
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,040
<35-12,SERENA>那为何不把你的个人因素放在一边
<35-12,SERENA>Then why don't you put aside your personal agenda

746
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,660
<35-12,SERENA>先听听我的不在场证词
<35-12,SERENA>and ask me for my alibi

747
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,370
<35-12,SERENA>这样我们就能继续调查了
<35-12,SERENA>so we can move on with this investigation?

748
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,850
<35-12,SERENA>我先声明  我接到电话的那天
<35-12,SERENA>For the record, I was in a business meeting

749
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,180
<35-12,SERENA>我正和我的一位老板在开会
<35-12,SERENA>with one of my bosses when I got the call...

750
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,870
<35-12,SERENA>你可以去调查
<35-12,SERENA>If you want to check.

751
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,820
<35-13,BECKETT>如果你说的都是事实
<35-13,BECKETT>If you're telling the truth,

752
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,170
<35-13,BECKETT>那你为什么总在我们背后搞鬼
<35-13,BECKETT>Then why have you been going behind our backs?

753
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,410
<35-14,SERENA>因为在我看来  警察总是很碍事
<35-14,SERENA>Because in my experience, the police just get in the way.

754
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,840
<35-14,SERENA>我的工作是找回雕像  而不是好好配合
<35-14,SERENA>My job's to recover the sculpture, not play nice.

755
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,950
<35-14,SERENA>不过你说得对
<35-14,SERENA>But you're right.

756
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,580
<35-14,SERENA>我把这案子当做一般案子处理  可这案子不一般
<35-14,SERENA>I've been treating this like a regular case, and it's not.

757
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,590
<35-14,SERENA>所以我保证  从现在开始  知无不言
<35-14,SERENA>So I promise, from here on out, no more secrets.

758
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,840
<35-14,SERENA>没那个必要
<35-14,SERENA>It won't be necessary.

759
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,990
<35-15,BECKETT>我们不会再合作了
<35-15,BECKETT>We won't be working together anymore.

760
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,740
<35-16,SERENA>如果我说  我知道法鲁克是谁
<35-16,SERENA>Would it change your mind if I told you,

761
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,770
<35-16,SERENA>你会改变主意吗
<35-16,SERENA>I know who falco is?

762
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,050
<36-1,SERENA>你们现在看的是
<36-1,SERENA>What you're watching right now

763
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,490
<36-1,SERENA>两周前博物馆展览的
<36-1,SERENA>is security footage from the museum exhibit

764
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,640
<36-1,SERENA>监控录像
<36-1,SERENA>from two weeks ago.

765
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,840
<36-2,BECKETT>你偷了海耶斯的U盘吗  怪不得找不到
<36-2,BECKETT>You stole Hayes' flash drive? That's why it went missing?

766
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,670
<36-3,CASTLE>别忘了  你是要让我们相信你
<36-3,CASTLE>Remember, you're trying to get us to trust you.

767
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,280
<36-4,SERENA>至少我亲你的时候是认真的
<36-4,SERENA>At least I meant it when I kissed you.

768
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,520
<36-4,SERENA>闪存盘留给你也没用
<36-4,SERENA>It wouldn't have done you any good.

769
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,930
<36-4,SERENA>你不知道该找些什么
<36-4,SERENA>You wouldn't know what to look for.

770
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,370
<36-5,SERENA>看到那个男人了吗
<36-5,SERENA>You see that guy right there?

771
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,050
<36-5,SERENA>他正在踩点
<36-5,SERENA>He's casing the joint.

772
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,060
<36-6,CASTLE>你怎么知道
<36-6,CASTLE>How can you tell?

773
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,110
<36-7,SERENA>相信我  我看得出来
<36-7,SERENA>Trust me. I can tell.

774
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,820
<36-8,BECKETT>-你是说那就是  -法鲁克
<36-8,BECKETT>- So you're saying that's-- - Falco.

775
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,360
<36-10,BECKETT>你之前为什么不告诉我们
<36-10,BECKETT>Well, why didn't you tell us this before?

776
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,870
<36-11,SERENA>我只是没找到机会拿给你看
<36-11,SERENA>Well, I just didn't get a chance to show you.

777
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,410
<36-12,BECKETT>-我猜你是挺忙的  -好了  好了
<36-12,BECKETT>- I guess you were busy. - Okay, okay.

778
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,420
<36-13,CASTLE>我们应该专注于怎样抓到他
<36-13,CASTLE>Perhaps we can just focus on getting this guy.

779
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,280
<36-14,BECKETT>这能帮上我们什么忙呢
<36-14,BECKETT>Well, how's this supposed to help?

780
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,980
<36-14,BECKETT>我们连他的真名都不知道
<36-14,BECKETT>We don't even know his real name.

781
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,770
<36-14,BECKETT>唯一能做的是把照片发给联邦运输安全局
<36-14,BECKETT>Well, the only thing we can do is send photos out to T.S.A.

782
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,640
<36-14,BECKETT>发布全境通告
<36-14,BECKETT>and put out an A.P.B.

783
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,120
<36-14,BECKETT>否则  再没有更多的信息
<36-14,BECKETT>Otherwise, without more information,

784
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,480
<36-14,BECKETT>这录像对我们也没什么帮助
<36-14,BECKETT>it's not gonna do us any good.

785
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,830
<36-15,ESPOSITO>如果我能告诉你他住在哪家酒店呢
<36-15,ESPOSITO>What if I could tell you which hotel he was staying at?

786
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,550
<36-15,ESPOSITO>在通风口和货车靠枕上找到的发胶
<36-15,ESPOSITO>The gel in the vents and on the headrest of the van,

787
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,970
<36-15,ESPOSITO>鉴证组已经证实是
<36-15,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. identified it as a proprietary formula

788
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,700
<36-15,ESPOSITO>为威塞克斯酒店特制的一种专有配方
<36-15,ESPOSITO>made exclusively for the Wessex Hotel.

789
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,860
<36-16,CASTLE>在纽约这酒店只有一家
<36-16,CASTLE>There's only one in the city.

790
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,570
<36-17,BECKETT>我们把照片拿去给酒店员工瞧瞧
<36-17,BECKETT>Let's get the photos out to the hotel employees.

791
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,770
<36-17,BECKETT>只要有员工认得他  我们就能抓住他了
<36-17,BECKETT>If one of them recognizes him, we got him.

792
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,900
<36-18,ESPOSITO>这就去
<36-18,ESPOSITO>Right on.

00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,140
<37-1,ESPOSITO>你好  法鲁克

798
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,450
<37-1,ESPOSITO>法鲁克
<37-1,ESPOSITO>Falco?

799
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,180
<38-1,WILLIAM HOLT>我真不知道你们在说什么
<38-1,WILLIAM HOLT>I've got no idea what you're talking about.

800
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,680
<38-1,WILLIAM HOLT>我叫霍特  威廉·霍特
<38-1,WILLIAM HOLT>My name is Holt. William Holt.

00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,780
<38-2,BECKETT>是的  威廉·霍特  持英国护照
<38-2,BECKETT>Yes, William Holt, British passport.

802
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,560
<38-2,BECKETT>你两周前刚到纽约
<38-2,BECKETT>You just got into town two weeks ago.

803
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,810
<38-2,BECKETT>十年前毕沙罗的画被偷时
<38-2,BECKETT>You also happened to be in Bilbao

805
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,510
<38-2,BECKETT>你刚巧也在毕尔巴鄂[西班牙港口]
<38-2,BECKETT>ten years ago when the Pissarro went missing.

806
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,870
<38-2,BECKETT>而十五年前埃尔·格列柯的画被偷时
<38-2,BECKETT>And then in Berlin 15 years ago

808
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,050
<38-2,BECKETT>你刚巧在柏林
<38-2,BECKETT>when that El Greco disappeared.

809
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,270
<38-3,HOLT>我真不知道那事
<38-3,HOLT>Don't know anything about that.

810
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,050
<38-4,BECKETT>别装了  法鲁克
<38-4,BECKETT>Drop the act, Falco.

811
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,760
<38-4,BECKETT>我们拿到了两周前你探查博物馆的录像
<38-4,BECKETT>We've got a video of you casing the museum two weeks ago.

812
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,660
<38-4,BECKETT>就是你  不是吗
<38-4,BECKETT>That is you, isn't it?

813
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,340
<38-5,HOLT>每当我来到一个新的城市
<38-5,HOLT>Whenever I come to a new town,

814
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,920
<38-5,HOLT>我总是会花时间去瞻仰这个城市的珍藏
<38-5,HOLT>I always take time out to admire the city's treasures.

815
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,490
<38-5,HOLT>那也算犯罪吗
<38-5,HOLT>Is that a crime?

816
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,070
<38-5,HOLT>不不  当然不是
<38-5,HOLT>No, no.

817
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,790
<38-6,CASTLE>但是偷偷溜回去偷走它们就是了
<38-6,CASTLE>But sneaking back in and stealing them is.

818
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,180
<38-7,BECKETT>看着眼熟吗
<38-7,BECKETT>Look familiar?

819
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,950
<38-7,BECKETT>它被用于解除
<38-7,BECKETT>It was used to disarm

820
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,180
<38-7,BECKETT>博物馆的安保系统
<38-7,BECKETT>the security systems in the museum.

821
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,850
<38-7,BECKETT>在毕尔巴鄂和柏林也找到了相同的东西
<38-7,BECKETT>They also found matching ones in Bilbao and Berlin.

822
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,440
<38-8,HOLT>就算你说的是真的
<38-8,HOLT>If you say so,

823
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,540
<38-8,HOLT>我也从没见过那样的东西
<38-8,HOLT>I, for one, have never seen anything like that.

824
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,430
<38-9,BECKETT>你住的酒店
<38-9,BECKETT>The hotel that you're staying it,

825
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,230
<38-9,BECKETT>很漂亮  对吗
<38-9,BECKETT>it's nice, isn't it?

826
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,370
<38-10,BECKETT>他们甚至提供独一无二的护发用品
<38-10,BECKETT>They even have their very own exclusive hair products.

827
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,780
<38-11,CASTLE>在风道系统里发现了护发品留下的痕迹
<38-11,CASTLE>Hair products that left a trace in the air duct system.

828
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,470
<38-11,CASTLE>顺便说下  用发胶
<38-11,CASTLE>And by the way, uh... hair gel,

829
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,660
<38-11,CASTLE>没有男子气概唉
<38-11,CASTLE>not very manly.

830
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,650
<38-12,HOLT>在我下榻的酒店有成百上千的住客
<38-12,HOLT>Hundreds of people are staying at my hotel,

831
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,240
<38-12,HOLT>我很肯定
<38-12,HOLT>and I'm pretty sure

832
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,430
<38-12,HOLT>你们在那上面没找到指纹
<38-12,HOLT>you didn't find prints on that.

833
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,530
<38-12,HOLT>所以
<38-12,HOLT>So...

834
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,300
<38-12,HOLT>你们到底准备控告我什么呢
<38-12,HOLT>What exactly were you planning to book me on?

835
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,620
<38-13,HOLT>你们追踪的法鲁克
<38-13,HOLT>This Falco person you're chasing...

836
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,780
<38-13,HOLT>你们确定他就是你们要找的人吗
<38-13,HOLT>Are you sure he's your guy?

837
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,600
<38-13,HOLT>因为据我所知  他可不是杀人犯
<38-13,HOLT>From what I know about him, he's no murderer.

838
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,020
<38-13,HOLT>或许他并没有如你们所想  牵扯其中
<38-13,HOLT>He may not be as involved as you think.

839
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,290
<39-1,SERENA>他在给我们暗示一些讯息
<39-1,SERENA>He's trying to tell us something.

840
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,100
<39-2,BECKETT>是啊  很艺术地告诉我们去死吧
<39-2,BECKETT>Yeah, to politely go to hell.

841
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,790
<39-3,SERENA>不  他违背原则告诉我们
<39-3,SERENA>No, he went out of his way to tell us,

842
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,740
<39-3,SERENA>他不是凶手
<39-3,SERENA>he's not the murderer.

843
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,650
<39-4,BECKETT>在审讯室  大多数人都说这话
<39-4,BECKETT>Well, most people do that in the room.

844
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,690
<39-4,BECKETT>鉴证组在酒店里找到什么证据没
<39-4,BECKETT>C.S.U. come back with anything from the hotel?

845
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,740
<39-5,RYAN>什么都没找到
<39-5,RYAN>Nothing.

846
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,770
<39-5,RYAN>没发现任何装备  没发现拳头
<39-5,RYAN>No equipment, no fist.

847
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,060
<39-6,CASTLE>你怎么看这事
<39-6,CASTLE>What are you thinking?

848
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,510
<39-7,SERENA>他知道些事
<39-7,SERENA>He knows something.

849
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,050
<39-7,SERENA>但他不能告诉我们
<39-7,SERENA>But he can't tell us

850
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,680
<39-7,SERENA>因为说了就证明他在凶案现场
<39-7,SERENA>without admitting he was there.

851
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,360
<39-7,SERENA>让我跟他谈谈
<39-7,SERENA>Let me talk to him.

852
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,590
<39-8,BECKETT>你在开玩笑  对吧
<39-8,BECKETT>You're kidding, right?

853
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,770
<39-8,BECKETT>他是嫌疑犯  而你又不是警察
<39-8,BECKETT>He's a suspect, and you're not even a cop.

854
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,910
<39-9,SERENA>不  我是小偷  跟他一样
<39-9,SERENA>No, I'm a thief, like him.

855
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,490
<39-9,SERENA>他会愿意跟我谈的
<39-9,SERENA>He'll talk to me.

856
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,080
<40-1,HOLT>坏警察三振出局
<40-1,HOLT>Bad cop struck out,

857
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,620
<40-1,HOLT>好警察乘虚而入吗
<40-1,HOLT>good cop gets a turn?

858
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,830
<40-2,SERENA>我可不是警察
<40-2,SERENA>I'm not a cop.

859
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,290
<40-3,HOLT>那你是谁
<40-3,HOLT>Then who are you?

860
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,300
<40-4,SERENA>那要看你问谁了
<40-4,SERENA>That depends on who you ask.

861
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,800
<40-4,SERENA>我是苏黎世的幽灵
<40-4,SERENA>I'm der Geist in Zurich,

862
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,000
<40-4,SERENA>西班牙的金钱豹
<40-4,SERENA>Pantera in Spain.

863
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,330
<40-4,SERENA>法国的警察叫我小淘气
<40-4,SERENA>Police nationale know me as Gaston.

864
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,230
<40-4,SERENA>至于你
<40-4,SERENA>But you...

865
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,990
<40-4,SERENA>可能会叫我
<40-4,SERENA>probably know me as...

866
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,300
<40-4,SERENA>豺狼
<40-4,SERENA>Jackal.

867
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,720
<40-5,HOLT>普拉多那次
<40-5,HOLT>The Prado.

868
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,590
<40-5,HOLT>07年
<40-5,HOLT>07?

869
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,950
<40-5,HOLT>是你干的
<40-5,HOLT>Are you saying that was you?

870
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,760
<40-7,HOLT>你是如何通过声音传感器的
<40-7,HOLT>How'd you get by the Sound Sensors?

871
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,290
<40-8,SERENA>我让俄国人为我造了个声波消音器
<40-8,SERENA>I had the Russian build me a wave cancellation box.

872
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,440
<40-8,SERENA>我听说他也为你波士顿那单做了个
<40-8,SERENA>I heard he built one for you for the Boston job?

873
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,780
<40-9,HOLT>普拉多那儿可不容易出去
<40-9,HOLT>That's no easy exit, Prado.

874
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,550
<40-9,HOLT>你是怎么把它带出去的
<40-9,HOLT>How did you get the piece out?

875
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,880
<40-10,HOLT>警卫忙着欣赏我的身材
<40-10,HOLT>The guard was so busy checking out my assets,

876
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,990
<40-10,HOLT>以致于他没注意到
<40-10,HOLT>that he didn't notice me

877
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,810
<40-10,HOLT>我把戈雅画后的绊网给剪了
<40-10,HOLT>cut the trip wire on the Goya's back.

879
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,690
<40-10,HOLT>夜幕初降时  我回去偷走了
<40-10,HOLT>I came in later on a skyline and whipped it right out.

880
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,700
<40-11,HOLT>真没想到
<40-11,HOLT>I'll be damned.

881
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,690
<40-12,HOLT>但你如今在这
<40-12,HOLT>But now you're here,

882
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,650
<40-12,HOLT>和警察共事
<40-12,HOLT>working with the cops.

883
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,570
<40-12,HOLT>所以你肯定是被抓了
<40-12,HOLT>So you must have got caught.

884
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,090
<40-13,SERENA>我变精明了
<40-13,SERENA>Mm. I got smart.

885
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,260
<40-13,SERENA>某一天你会发现
<40-13,SERENA>One day you realize

886
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,930
<40-13,SERENA>你或者他人终会受伤
<40-13,SERENA>that you or someone else is going to get hurt.

887
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,690
<40-14,HOLT>我没杀他
<40-14,HOLT>I didn't kill him.

888
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,450
<40-15,SERENA>但是你在凶案现场
<40-15,SERENA>But you were there.

889
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,110
<41-1,CASTLE>你觉得她能使他开口吗
<41-1,CASTLE>Think she'll get him to talk?

890
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:47,770
<41-2,BECKETT>谁知道呢  卡塞尔
<41-2,BECKETT>Who knows, Castle?

891
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,550
<41-2,BECKETT>也许她会把真相亲出来
<41-2,BECKETT>Maybe she'll kiss it out of him.

892
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,320
<41-2,BECKETT>我不是被雇佣去偷"拳头"的
<41-2,BECKETT>I wasn't hired to steal the fist.

893
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,410
<41-2,BECKETT>我的联系人告诉我  我是被雇
<41-2,BECKETT>My contact told me that I was being paid

894
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,690
<42-1,HOLT>去检验安保系统的缺陷
<42-1,HOLT>to test their security for vulnerabilities.

895
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,820
<42-1,HOLT>我潜进去  弄坏警报器
<42-1,HOLT>I was to break in, disable the alarm,

896
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,950
<42-1,HOLT>悄无声息的走出来
<42-1,HOLT>and walk out undetected,

897
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,160
<42-1,HOLT>要在晚十点前搞定
<42-1,HOLT>all before 10:00 p.m.

898
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,440
<42-1,HOLT>因为麻烦我再次出山
<42-1,HOLT>And for my trouble,

899
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,660
<42-1,HOLT>我收了20万定金
<42-1,HOLT>I got 200 grand in advance.

900
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,260
<42-2,SERENA>谁雇的你
<42-2,SERENA>Who hired you?

901
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,810
<42-3,HOLT>亲爱的  谁知道呢
<42-3,HOLT>Oh, church and state, love.

902
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,670
<42-3,HOLT>一切都是通过第三方交易的
<42-3,HOLT>Everything goes through a third party.

903
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,310
<42-3,HOLT>你明白的  那样更安全
<42-3,HOLT>You know that. It's safer that way.

904
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,950
<42-4,SERENA>知道  直到你被下套了
<42-4,SERENA>Mm. Yeah, until you get set up.

905
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,390
<42-4,SERENA>真正的窃贼需要你去破坏警报器
<42-4,SERENA>The real thief needed you to disable the alarms.

906
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,640
<42-5,HOLT>对  很明显就是这样
<42-5,HOLT>Yeah, apparently.

907
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,700
<42-6,SERENA>你看到什么了吗
<42-6,SERENA>What'd you see?

908
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,240
<42-7,HOLT>最初什么都没看到
<42-7,HOLT>Nothing at first.

909
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,850
<42-7,HOLT>我的意思是
<42-7,HOLT>I mean...

910
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,190
<42-7,HOLT>一切都太顺利了
<42-7,HOLT>it had all been too easy.

911
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
<42-7,HOLT>我都快要回到卸货区了  才反应过来
<42-7,HOLT>I got halfway back to the loading bay when it hit me--

912
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,640
<42-7,HOLT>报警器已经被我解除了
<42-7,HOLT>I mean, I'd already disabled the alarms, right?

913
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,040
<42-7,HOLT>而"拳头"就在那
<42-7,HOLT>And it was just, oh, sitting there.

914
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,400
<42-8,SERENA>你为了"拳头"折返了
<42-8,SERENA>You went back for the fist.

915
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,130
<42-9,HOLT>诱惑十足  五千万啊
<42-9,HOLT>It's an awful lot of temptation, $50 mil.

916
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,840
<42-9,HOLT>当我回到那里时
<42-9,HOLT>When I got back to the room,

917
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,820
<42-9,HOLT>有个女人正走向"拳头"
<42-9,HOLT>there was a woman walking toward the fist.

918
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,890
<42-9,HOLT>我就赶紧跑路了
<42-9,HOLT>So I got the bloody hell outta there.

919
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,640
<42-10,SERENA>这个女人长什么样
<42-10,SERENA>This woman, what did she look like?

920
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,240
<42-11,HOLT>我只是瞟了一眼
<42-11,HOLT>I barely got a glimpse.

921
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,320
<42-11,HOLT>我只确定一点
<42-11,HOLT>All I can say for sure is,

922
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,270
<42-11,HOLT>她穿着一条黑裙子
<42-11,HOLT>she was wearing a black dress.

923
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,880
<42-11,HOLT>贝克特
<42-11,HOLT>Come on, Beckett.

924
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,330
<43-1,SERENA>他没有任何理由说谎
<43-1,SERENA>He's got no reason to lie.

925
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:02,950
<43-1,SERENA>他是个小偷
<43-1,SERENA>He's a thief.

926
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,960
<43-2,BECKETT>他有很多理由撒谎
<43-2,BECKETT>He's got plenty of reasons to lie.

927
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,190
<43-3,SERENA>但不是在这事上
<43-3,SERENA>Not about this.

928
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,800
<43-3,SERENA>他知道你在他身上没查到什么
<43-3,SERENA>He knows you've got nothing on him.

929
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,820
<43-3,SERENA>他只需坐着等  而你必须释放他
<43-3,SERENA>All he had to do was wait, and you'd have to release him.

930
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,270
<43-4,CASTLE>如果法鲁克说的是实话
<43-4,CASTLE>If Falco is telling the truth,

931
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,830
<43-4,CASTLE>考虑到海耶斯入不敷出
<43-4,CASTLE>then with Hayes' money trouble,

932
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,400
<43-4,CASTLE>给法鲁克那20万便排除了他的嫌疑
<43-4,CASTLE>the $200,000 payment to Falco rules him out.

933
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,780
<43-5,BECKETT>那为什么他会去酒吧  询问如何把钻石脱手
<43-5,BECKETT>Then why would he go to the bar, asking about fencing diamonds?

934
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,160
<43-6,SERENA>因为他多疑有人会偷走"拳头"
<43-6,SERENA>Because he was paranoid someone was trying to steal the fist.

935
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,930
<43-7,CASTLE>不是多疑  他是对的
<43-7,CASTLE>Not paranoid. Right.

936
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,220
<43-7,CASTLE>也就是说  凶手很可能就是
<43-7,CASTLE>Which means our killer's probably

937
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,520
<43-7,CASTLE>法鲁克看见走进那间房去偷"拳头"的人
<43-7,CASTLE>whomever Falco saw going into the room with the fist.

938
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,770
<43-8,SERENA>当海耶斯妨碍到她时   她就把他杀了
<43-8,SERENA>And when Hayes got in the way, she spiked him.

939
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,770
<43-9,BECKETT>他有没有说那个女人长什么样
<43-9,BECKETT>Did he say anything about what the woman looked like?

940
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,920
<43-10,SERENA>他只说她穿着条黑色的裙子
<43-10,SERENA>Just that she was wearing a black dress.

941
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,260
<43-11,BECKETT>二百多人出席了晚宴
<43-11,BECKETT>There were over 200 people at that gala,

942
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,150
<43-11,BECKETT>一半以上的女人都穿着黑裙子
<43-11,BECKETT>and half of those women were wearing black.

943
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,950
<43-12,SERENA>更重要的是
<43-12,SERENA>And more importantly,

944
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,470
<43-12,SERENA>如果她不是从卸货区离开的
<43-12,SERENA>if she didn't leave by the loading dock,

945
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,630
<43-12,SERENA>那她到底是怎么把"拳头"从博物馆里弄走的
<43-12,SERENA>then how did she get the fist out of the museum?

946
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,290
<43-13,BECKETT>是呀  到底是怎么弄走的呢
<43-13,BECKETT>Yeah. How did she?

947
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,910
<44-1,CASTLE>她等到法鲁克黑了监视器以后
<44-1,CASTLE>She waits for Falco to finish disabling the system,

948
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,690
<44-1,CASTLE>就从晚宴走到这里
<44-1,CASTLE>and then she comes in through the gala.

949
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,600
<44-2,BECKETT>她知道监视器已经被黑了
<44-2,BECKETT>And with the alarm system deactivated,

950
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,730
<44-2,BECKETT>于是便拿起"拳头"
<44-2,BECKETT>she grabs the fist.

951
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,990
<44-2,BECKETT>但海耶斯一直对安保系统不放心
<44-2,BECKETT>But Hayes is paranoid about security,

952
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,520
<44-2,BECKETT>所以他就进来查看展品
<44-2,BECKETT>so he comes in to check on the exhibit.

953
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,130
<44-2,BECKETT>他把她逮了个正着
<44-2,BECKETT>He catches her...

954
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,280
<44-2,BECKETT>于是她不得不杀了他
<44-2,BECKETT>And she's forced to kill him.

955
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
<44-3,SERENA>现在她要赶在别人发现
<44-3,SERENA>Now she's in a hurry to leave

956
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,520
<44-3,SERENA>尸体和她手中的"拳头"前离开这里
<44-3,SERENA>before someone discovers her with the fist and a body.

957
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
<44-4,CASTLE>但是她不能拿着"拳头"从晚宴走出去
<44-4,CASTLE>Ah, but she can't take it out through the gala

958
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,930
<44-4,CASTLE>那样一定会被人看到
<44-4,CASTLE>without being spotted...

960
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,230
<44-5,BECKETT>不然的话  卸货区的酒筵公司员工
<44-5,BECKETT>without one of the catering staff

961
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,000
<44-5,BECKETT>会注意到黑衣女子
<44-5,BECKETT>noticing her dressed in black.

962
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,810
<44-6,SERENA>晚宴和卸货区是仅有的两个出口
<44-6,SERENA>Well, those are the only two exits.

963
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,030
<44-6,SERENA>而这两个出口都太危险了
<44-6,SERENA>And both of those choices leave too much to chance.

964
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,310
<44-6,SERENA>她无论走哪个都很容易被逮到
<44-6,SERENA>She would've easily gotten caught.

965
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,650
<44-7,BECKETT>这么说她不能从晚宴离开
<44-7,BECKETT>So if she can't take it through the gala

966
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,130
<44-7,BECKETT>也不能从卸货区离开
<44-7,BECKETT>and she can't take it through the loading bay,

967
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,860
<44-7,BECKETT>那她到底是怎么把"拳头"带出去的呢
<44-7,BECKETT>how the hell did she get it outta here?

968
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,140
<44-8,CASTLE>也许她根本没拿出去
<44-8,CASTLE>Maybe she didn't.

969
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,430
<44-9,BECKETT>你什么意思
<44-9,BECKETT>What do you mean?

970
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,370
<44-10,CASTLE>我的意思是
<44-10,CASTLE>What I mean is...

971
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,690
<44-11,MYRNA>你在干吗
<44-11,MYRNA>What are you doing?!

972
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,030
<44-12,CASTLE>它一直就没离开博物馆
<44-12,CASTLE>it never left the museum.

973
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,760
<44-13,MYRNA>卡塞尔先生
<44-13,MYRNA>Mr. Castle.

974
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,350
<44-14,CASTLE>看来我找到了这件案子的重大突破口
<44-14,CASTLE>Looks like I broke this case wide open.

975
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,120
<45-1,ALYSSA>你要见我吗  警探
<45-1,ALYSSA>You needed to see me, detective?

976
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,080
<45-2,BECKETT>没错  我们想跟你谈谈你的现代雕塑
<45-2,BECKETT>Yes, we need to talk to you about your installation.

977
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,990
<45-3,ALYSSA>天啊  发生什么事了
<45-3,ALYSSA>Oh, my god. What happened?

978
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,050
<45-4,CASTLE>这是我对这件艺术品的全新诠释
<45-4,CASTLE>It's a new interpretation I'm working on.

979
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,460
<45-4,CASTLE>我称它为  人赃并获
<45-4,CASTLE>I call it...busted.

980
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,500
<45-5,ALYSSA>这件艺术品被毁了  是谁干的
<45-5,ALYSSA>It's ruined. Who the hell did this?

981
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,990
<45-6,BECKETT>更重要的是  是谁把"拳头"放到里面的
<45-6,BECKETT>More to the point, who put the fist in it?

982
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,410
<45-7,ALYSSA>"拳头"在这里面吗
<45-7,ALYSSA>The fist was inside it?

983
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,170
<45-8,CASTLE>这样一来  盗贼就不用担心
<45-8,CASTLE>That way, the thief didn't have to worry

984
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,070
<45-8,CASTLE>怎么把它运出去了
<45-8,CASTLE>about smuggling it out.

985
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,540
<45-8,CASTLE>她可以返回派对
<45-8,CASTLE>She could simply rejoin the party.

986
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,650
<45-9,ALYSSA>她
<45-9,ALYSSA>She?

987
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,480
<45-10,BECKETT>我们知道偷走拳头的人
<45-10,BECKETT>We know that whoever stole the fist

988
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,100
<45-10,BECKETT>是个身穿黑裙的女人
<45-10,BECKETT>was a woman wearing a black dress --

989
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,220
<45-10,BECKETT>她还杀害了海耶斯先生
<45-10,BECKETT>The same woman that killed Mr. Hayes.

990
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,920
<45-11,CASTLE>如果我记得没错的话
<45-11,CASTLE>If I remember correctly,

991
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,200
<45-11,CASTLE>你当晚穿了一条黑裙子
<45-11,CASTLE>you were wearing a black dress that night.

992
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,270
<45-12,ALYSSA>当晚出席的所有女人都穿着黑裙子
<45-12,ALYSSA>So was every woman in here.

993
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,370
<45-13,CASTLE>没错  可是只有一个人知道
<45-13,CASTLE>Yes, but only one of them knew

994
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,470
<45-13,CASTLE>这件艺术品里
<45-13,CASTLE>that there was a compartment

995
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,280
<45-13,CASTLE>有个隔层
<45-13,CASTLE>inside that piece nearby.

996
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,790
<45-13,CASTLE>这个计划本是完美无缺
<45-13,CASTLE>It was the perfect plan

997
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,590
<45-13,CASTLE>直到布莱恩·海耶斯突然出现  看到了你
<45-13,CASTLE>until Bryan Hayes showed up and saw you.

998
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,610
<45-14,ALYSSA>等一下  这  这不是我干的
<45-14,ALYSSA>Wait. I-it wasn't me.

999
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,590
<45-14,ALYSSA>我发誓
<45-14,ALYSSA>I swear.

1000
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,280
<45-15,BECKETT>你是说  不是你一个人干的
<45-15,BECKETT>You mean, it wasn't just you.

1001
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,850
<45-15,BECKETT>你没有那么多钱来雇法鲁克
<45-15,BECKETT>You didn't have the money to pay Falco,

1002
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,100
<45-15,BECKETT>但是你凭借你的职务之便
<45-15,BECKETT>but you did use your position

1003
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,760
<45-15,BECKETT>把这件艺术品放到展会上来展览
<45-15,BECKETT>to place the piece in the exhibit.

1004
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,770
<45-16,ALYSSA>我什么都没干
<45-16,ALYSSA>I didn't place anything.

1005
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
<45-16,ALYSSA>我的作品就跟这里的其它作品一样
<45-16,ALYSSA>My piece was selected by the board,

1006
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,340
<45-16,ALYSSA>都是被董事会选中的
<45-16,ALYSSA>just like all of the art in here.

1007
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,030
<45-17,CASTLE>没错  而且等到展览结束后
<45-17,CASTLE>Yes, and when the exhibit was done,

1008
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,170
<45-17,CASTLE>这件展品还会回到你手上
<45-17,CASTLE>it would come back to you,

1009
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,230
<45-17,CASTLE>只不过那时它的价值就升了五千万美金
<45-17,CASTLE>only worth about $50 million more.

1010
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,870
<45-18,ALYSSA>不  它根本就不会回到我手上
<45-18,ALYSSA>No, it wasn't coming back to me.

1011
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,140
<45-18,ALYSSA>它上周就已经被卖掉了  卖给了
<45-18,ALYSSA>I sold it last week. It was going to...

1012
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,340
<45-19,ALYSSA>天啊
<45-19,ALYSSA>Oh, my god.

1013
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,460
<46-1,JOY>我觉得艾丽莎的作品很吸引我
<46-1,JOY>I found Alyssa's work compelling.

1014
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,300
<46-1,JOY>我不明白我为什么要跟你们解释我的艺术鉴赏力
<46-1,JOY>I'm not sure why I'm having to justify my taste in art.

1015
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,120
<46-2,BECKETT>因为这件艺术品里恰恰
<46-2,BECKETT>Because this particular piece just happened to have

1016
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,940
<46-2,BECKETT>藏着铜拳
<46-2,BECKETT>a bronze fist in it.

1017
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,590
<46-3,JOY>你找到我的"拳头"了
<46-3,JOY>You found my fist.

1018
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,350
<46-4,BECKETT>没错  是你把它放到那的
<46-4,BECKETT>Yes, right where you put it.

1019
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,080
<46-5,BECKETT>现在你该好好想想
<46-5,BECKETT>You know, right about now is where you should be thinking

1020
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,870
<46-5,BECKETT>你推倒海耶斯到底是故意的还是个意外
<46-5,BECKETT>about whether pushing Hayes was an accident or not,

1021
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,020
<46-5,BECKETT>因为一念之差
<46-5,BECKETT>because that's gonna make

1022
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,320
<46-5,BECKETT>可是相差着三十年的刑罚呢
<46-5,BECKETT>a 30-year difference in your prison sentence.

1023
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,690
<46-6,JOY>你认为是我杀了布莱恩·海耶斯吗
<46-6,JOY>You think I did that to Bryan Hayes?

1024
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,060
<46-7,BECKETT>我们已经拿到了搜查令去查你的财务情况
<46-7,BECKETT>Now we've obtained a warrant for your financials,

1025
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,570
<46-7,BECKETT>而我们会找到了证据证明你付给
<46-7,BECKETT>and we will find evidence of the $200,000

1026
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,570
<46-7,BECKETT>威廉·霍特也就是法鲁克
<46-7,BECKETT>you paid to William Holt,

1027
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,240
<46-7,BECKETT>二十万美金来黑掉博物馆的监控系统
<46-7,BECKETT>also known as Falco, to disable security at the museum.

1028
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,940
<46-8,JOY>抱歉  亲爱的  我不知道你在说什么
<46-8,JOY>I'm sorry, dear. You've lost me.

1029
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,430
<46-9,BECKETT>鉴证组发现"拳头"上布满了你的指纹
<46-9,BECKETT>C.S.U. found your fingerprints all over the fist.

1030
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,510
<46-10,JOY>那是当然  "拳头"本来就是我的东西
<46-10,JOY>Of course they did. It belongs to me.

1031
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,220
<46-11,BECKETT>带血的指纹  他的血
<46-11,BECKETT>Bloody fingerprints -- his blood,

1032
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,620
<46-11,BECKETT>你的指纹
<46-11,BECKETT>your prints.

1033
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,350
<46-11,BECKETT>一切都结束了
<46-11,BECKETT>It's over.

1034
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,310
<46-12,BECKETT>你杀了人  麦克休太太
<46-12,BECKETT>You killed a man, Mrs. McHugh.

1035
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,590
<46-12,BECKETT>你不明白
<46-12,BECKETT>You don't understand.

1036
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,520
<46-13,JOY>我丈夫要把它从我手里夺走
<46-13,JOY>My husband was going to take it away.

1037
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,180
<46-13,JOY>我只是拿走了原本就属于我的东西而已
<46-13,JOY>I just took what was rightfully mine.

1038
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,210
<46-13,JOY>布莱恩·海耶斯突然出现
<46-13,JOY>Bryan Hayes showed up out of nowhere.

1039
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
<46-13,JOY>他看到我手里拿着"拳头"
<46-13,JOY>He saw me with the fist in my hands.

1040
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,990
<46-13,JOY>我还能怎么办
<46-13,JOY>What was I supposed to do?

1041
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
<46-14,BECKETT>你知道讽刺的是什么吗
<46-14,BECKETT>You know what's ironic?

1042
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,790
<46-14,BECKETT>你丈夫本来就计划把"拳头"留给你
<46-14,BECKETT>Your husband would've let you have the fist.

1043
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,710
<46-14,BECKETT>他根本就不想要
<46-14,BECKETT>He didn't even want it.

1044
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,700
<47-1,BECKETT>检察官说她丈夫打过无数个电话来
<47-1,BECKETT>The D.A. said that her husband called several times,

1045
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,560
<47-1,BECKETT>恳求检察官允许他指证自己的妻子
<47-1,BECKETT>begging to testify against her.

1046
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,750
<47-2,SERENA>我什么时候可以把"拳头"拿回来
<47-2,SERENA>When can I collect the fist?

1047
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,970
<47-2,SERENA>是保险公司在问
<47-2,SERENA>The insurance company's asking.

1048
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,140
<47-3,BECKETT>现在它还是物证
<47-3,BECKETT>Well, it's in evidence.

1049
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,070
<47-3,BECKETT>一旦案子结了  你就可以把它拿回去了
<47-3,BECKETT>Once the case is resolved, they'll release it.

1050
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,870
<47-4,SERENA>我想向你道谢
<47-4,SERENA>I want to thank you.

1051
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,760
<47-4,SERENA>要是没有你  我也找不回"拳头"
<47-4,SERENA>I couldn't have done this without you.

1052
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,050
<47-4,SERENA>我真的很感谢你
<47-4,SERENA>I'm really grateful.

1053
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,540
<47-5,BECKETT>这么说你会把你的佣金分我点咯
<47-5,BECKETT>So does that mean you're cutting me in on the finder's fee?

1054
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,920
<47-6,SERENA>我还没感激到那个地步
<47-6,SERENA>I'm not that grateful.

1055
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,730
<47-7,BECKETT>我
<47-7,BECKETT>Well, I, uh...

1056
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,110
<47-8,BECKETT>我想我们最终都得到了自己想要的东西
<47-8,BECKETT>think we all ended up with what we wanted.

1057
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,270
<47-9,SERENA>没错
<47-9,SERENA>Yeah.

1058
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,130
<47-10,BECKETT>你知道
<47-10,BECKETT>Um, you know...

1059
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,090
<47-10,BECKETT>在你跟卡塞尔的那次约会之后
<47-10,BECKETT>after you and Castle went on that date --

1060
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,490
<47-11,SERENA>哪里是约会  纯粹是骗局
<47-11,SERENA>More like a sting.

1061
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,130
<47-12,BECKETT>他  一直坚信你跟这件事无关
<47-12,BECKETT>He...never thought that you were involved.

1062
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,110
<47-12,BECKETT>虽然我当时怀疑你  但他一直相信你
<47-12,BECKETT>He believed in you, even when I didn't.

1063
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,000
<47-13,SERENA>你为什么要告诉我这些
<47-13,SERENA>Why are you telling me this?

1064
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,420
<47-14,BECKETT>我只是  我只是觉得你应该知道
<47-14,BECKETT>I just -- I, I think that you should know

1079
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,500

<47-27,CASTLE>他们好歹也该放我一马吧
<47-27,CASTLE>after the whole "helping to solve the murder" thing.
