1
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,830
<1-1,CASTLE>能不能
<1-1,CASTLE>Can't you--

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,930
<1-1,CASTLE>能不能
<1-1,CASTLE>Can't--

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,070
<1-1,CASTLE>告诉我这到底有多严重
<1-1,CASTLE>Just at least tell me how serious it is.

5
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,220
<1-1,CASTLE>这辆被偷的车是怎么回事
<1-1,CASTLE>What's with the stripped cab?

6
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,150
<2-1,BECKETT>保安也纳闷同样的问题
<2-1,BECKETT>Security guard wondered the same thing.

7
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,120
<2-2,ESPOSITO>然后就发现了这具尸体
<2-2,ESPOSITO>That's when he came across the body.

8
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,190
<2-3,BECKETT>死者是谁
<2-3,BECKETT>Who's our victim?

9
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,290
<2-4,ESPOSITO>阿米尔·阿哈比  出租车司机
<2-4,ESPOSITO>Amir Alhabi, taxi driver.

10
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,740
<2-5,BECKETT>好  联系汽车偷盗调查部门
<2-5,BECKETT>All right. Contact Auto Theft.

11
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,120
<2-5,BECKETT>让他们留意这辆车被偷的零件
<2-5,BECKETT>Have 'em on the lookout for these stolen car parts.

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,010
<2-6,ESPOSITO>已经联系了
<2-6,ESPOSITO>Already done.

13
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,340
<2-7,BECKETT>死者携带有现金吗
<2-7,BECKETT>Was there money on the body?

14
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,780
<2-8,ESPOSITO>身上没有  车上也没有
<2-8,ESPOSITO>Not on the body, not in the cab.

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,720
<2-8,ESPOSITO>所有证据显示这是为财谋杀
<2-8,ESPOSITO>Everything points to him being popped for cash and car parts.

16
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,440
<2-9,LANIE>宝贝  也不全是
<2-9,LANIE>Not everything, baby.

17
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,720
<2-10,BECKETT>-你刚叫他宝贝吗  -有吗
<2-10,BECKETT>- Did you just call him baby? - Ooh, did I?

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,030
<2-13,BECKETT>发现什么异常情况了吗
<2-13,BECKETT>Anyway, you found something unusual?

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,410
<2-14,LANIE>现在有了  死亡时间和抢劫时间吻合
<2-14,LANIE>Not at first. Time of death fits a robbery.

20
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,820
<2-14,LANIE>死者在11点15分被杀
<2-14,LANIE>He was killed at 11:15.

21
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,640
<2-15,CASTLE>时间如此精确  佩服
<2-15,CASTLE>So specific. I'm impressed.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,990
<2-16,LANIE>他摔倒时表坏了
<2-16,LANIE>His watch broke when he fell.

23
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,090
<2-17,CASTLE>真不该告诉我这个  没那么佩服了
<2-17,CASTLE>Ah, you shouldn't have told me. Less impressed.

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,270
<2-18,LANIE>死亡原因也相吻合
<2-18,LANIE>Cause of death fits, too.

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,270
<2-18,LANIE>一颗9毫米口径子弹击中脑部致死
<2-18,LANIE>Looks like a 9-millimeter to the noggin.

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,000
<2-18,LANIE>但是有一点并不吻合
<2-18,LANIE>But there's something that doesn't fit.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
<2-18,LANIE>他的手指  接连断裂
<2-18,LANIE>His fingers... were broken one at a time.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,010
<2-19,CASTLE>的哥们有时把钱藏起来
<2-19,CASTLE>Cabbies sometimes hide their money.

29
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,270
<2-19,CASTLE>也许是凶手折磨他  逼他说出藏钱之处
<2-19,CASTLE>Maybe they tortured him to tell them where the money was.

30
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,730
<2-20,BECKETT>查一下他的行车地点
<2-20,BECKETT>All right, let's find out where he was driving

31
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,660
<2-20,BECKETT>以及临死前搭载的乘客
<2-20,BECKETT>and who he picked up before he wound up here.

32
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,330
<2-20,BECKETT>阿米尔·阿哈比
<2-20,BECKETT>Amir Alhabi--

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,300
<3-1,RYAN>是一个成功移民实例
<3-1,RYAN>He's a real immigrant success story.

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,730
<3-1,RYAN>七年前从叙利亚来到美国
<3-1,RYAN>Came over from Syria seven years ago

35
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,710
<3-1,RYAN>去年六月成为美国公民
<3-1,RYAN>became a citizen last June.

36
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,260
<3-1,RYAN>据出租车管理协会消息称
<3-1,RYAN>According to the taxi and limo commission,

37
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,290
<3-1,RYAN>他和表兄杰马尔共同拥有这辆车和相关许可
<3-1,RYAN>he owned his cab and medallion with a cousin--Jamal.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,460
<3-2,BECKETT>呃  好的
<3-2,BECKETT>Um... Right.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,310
<3-2,BECKETT>管理协会应该知道阿米尔昨天在哪吧
<3-2,BECKETT>W-well, T.L.C. would know where Amir was, right?

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,160
<3-2,BECKETT>他们监控出租车吧
<3-2,BECKETT>They track cabs?

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,170
<3-3,RYAN>只有在计价器开启的情况下
<3-3,RYAN>Only when the meter is running.

42
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,000
<3-3,RYAN>昨天10点2分阿米尔关掉了计价器
<3-3,RYAN>Amir shut his off at 10:02 p.m.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
<3-4,CASTLE>没办法查明他死前去了哪吗
<3-4,CASTLE>So there's no way to tell where he went before he died.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,730
<3-5,RYAN>实际上  有办法
<3-5,RYAN>Actually, there is.

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,180
<3-5,RYAN>阿米尔订了一个全球定位追踪服务
<3-5,RYAN>Amir subscribed to a GPS tracking service.

46
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,880
<3-5,RYAN>用来帮助的哥们标出最佳
<3-5,RYAN>It helps cabbies map out the best place

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,510
<3-5,RYAN>拉客地点  等等之类的
<3-5,RYAN>to troll for fares, stuff like that.

48
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,750
<3-6,RYAN>阿米尔关掉计价器之后
<3-6,RYAN>Anyway, after Amir shut off his meter,

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,250
<3-6,RYAN>驶向华盛顿高地
<3-6,RYAN>he drove up to Washington heights.

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,650
<3-6,RYAN>在圣尼古拉斯大街1600号停下
<3-6,RYAN>He parked in the 1600 block of St. Nicholas Avenue

51
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,440
<3-6,RYAN>六分钟以后  计价器又运行
<3-6,RYAN>for six minutes, motor running,

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,270
<3-6,RYAN>他就开向了仓库
<3-6,RYAN>then he drove to the warehouse.

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,120
<3-7,BECKETT>那个时间的华盛顿高地
<3-7,BECKETT>Okay, Washington heights is a shady place

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,430
<3-7,BECKETT>人员混杂  如果他关闭计价器
<3-7,BECKETT>that time of night, and if he turned off his meter,

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,320
<3-7,BECKETT>-肯定不是拉生意  -也许他被打劫
<3-7,BECKETT>- he wasn't looking for a fare. - Maybe he was carjacked

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,790
<3-8,CASTLE>被迫开车到仓库去
<3-8,CASTLE>and forced to drive to that warehouse.

57
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,640
<3-9,BECKETT>让便衣去排查那个地方
<3-9,BECKETT>All right, have unis canvass the area.

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,360
<3-9,BECKETT>看有没有人见过死者
<3-9,BECKETT>See if anyone remembers seeing him.

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,530
<3-9,BECKETT>他最后的电话打给谁的
<3-9,BECKETT>What about his last phone call?

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,010
<3-10,RYAN>10点01分打给他老婆纳兹哈·阿哈比
<3-10,RYAN>10:01 to his wife-- Nazihah Alhabi.

61
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,910
<3-11,BECKETT>去看看
<3-11,BECKETT>Okay. Let's go.

62
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,230
<3-12,RYAN>其实手机上还有个东西
<3-12,RYAN>Actually, there was one more thing on the phone.

63
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,570
<3-12,RYAN>阿米尔开启了记事本功能
<3-12,RYAN>Amir opened a notebook application,

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,260
<3-12,RYAN>写下了这个
<3-12,RYAN>And he, uh, wrote down this.

65
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,900
<3-13,CASTLE>C4121652
<3-13,CASTLE>Uh, "C4121652,"

66
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,440
<3-13,CASTLE>死者是在死前一个小时写下的
<3-13,CASTLE>And it was written down just about an hour before he died.

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,500
<3-14,RYAN>这不是车牌号
<3-14,RYAN>And it's not a license tag.

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,950
<3-15,BECKETT>查一下  看能不能查明白
<3-15,BECKETT>All right. See if you can figure it out.

69
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,150
<3-16,CASTLE>我知道了  七个数字  是个电话号码
<3-16,CASTLE>I got it. Seven digits-- it's a phone number.

70
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,510
<3-16,CASTLE>"C"是号码拥有者的姓名缩写
<3-16,CASTLE>"C" is the initial of the person to whom it belongs.

71
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,260
<3-17,RYAN>我已经查过了
<3-17,RYAN>I already tried that.

72
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,380
<3-18,CASTLE>所有纽约的区号都试过了吗
<3-18,CASTLE>With all the new york area codes?

73
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,050
<3-18,CASTLE>-对  -有意思  也许...
<3-18,CASTLE>- Yeah. - Intriguing. Maybe--

74
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,200
<3-18,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -来了
<3-18,CASTLE>- Castle. - Coming.

75
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,200
<3-18,CASTLE>阿哈比夫人
<3-18,CASTLE>Mrs. Alhabi,

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,560
<4-1,BECKETT>我们知道昨天十点阿米尔给你打过电话
<4-1,BECKETT>We understand that Amir called you at 10:00.

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,670
<4-1,BECKETT>-你们说了什么  -他说会晚回家
<4-1,BECKETT>- What did the two of you talk about? - Just that he'd be late.

78
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,600
<4-2,NAZIHAH ALHABI>人们都从百老汇剧院刚出来
<4-2,NAZIHAH ALHABI>The plays were getting out on Broadway,

79
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,340
<4-2,NAZIHAH ALHABI>他想再多拉点活
<4-2,NAZIHAH ALHABI>and he wanted to pick up more fares.

80
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,180
<4-3,BECKETT>实际上  他没拉活  他关掉了计价器
<4-3,BECKETT>Actually, he didn't do that. He turned his meter off

81
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,780
<4-3,BECKETT>去了华盛顿高地
<4-3,BECKETT>and he went up to Washington heights.

82
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,930
<4-3,BECKETT>那里常有毒品交易和卖淫嫖娼
<4-3,BECKETT>That part of town is known for drug dealing and prostitution.

83
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,620
<4-4,NAZIHAH ALHABI>不  他不会做这种事的
<4-4,NAZIHAH ALHABI>No, he would never do such things.

84
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,220
<4-5,NAZIHAH ALHABI>杰马尔  谢谢
<4-5,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Jamal, thank you.

85
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,280
<4-6,CASTLE>阿米尔的手机上还有一个记录
<4-6,CASTLE>Uh, there was an annotation on Amir's phone.

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,820
<4-6,CASTLE>知道是什么吗
<4-6,CASTLE>Do you have any idea what this is?

87
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,580
<4-6,CASTLE>C4121652
<4-6,CASTLE>"C4121652."

88
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,120
<4-7,JAMAL ALHABI>不知道  我以为这是一起抢劫案
<4-7,JAMAL ALHABI>No, I-I thought this was a robbery, that he was robbed.

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,690
<4-8,BECKETT>是  不过任何其他小线索也可能有干系
<4-8,BECKETT>It was. It's just, any minor detail might be relevant.

90
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,860
<4-8,BECKETT>他最近怎么样
<4-8,BECKETT>How did he seem lately?

91
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,930
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>为钱所困扰
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Worried about money.

92
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,220
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>玛丽卡  我们的女儿  需要做手术
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Malika, our daughter, she needed surgery.

93
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,130
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>非常的难熬
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>It's been very hard.

94
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,580
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>她永远也见不到自己的爸爸了
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>She'll never know her father.

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,490
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>恕我失陪
<4-9,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Please excuse me.

96
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,550
<4-10,BECKETT>杰马尔  你和阿米尔是生意伙伴吗
<4-10,BECKETT>Jamal, you and Amir were business partners?

97
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,450
<4-11,BECKETT>近来生意怎么样
<4-11,BECKETT>How was the business doing?

98
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,350
<4-12,JAMAL ALHABI>单靠开出租是发不了财的
<4-12,JAMAL ALHABI>You don't get rich driving a cab,

99
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,520
<4-12,JAMAL ALHABI>但是我们赚到钱了
<4-12,JAMAL ALHABI>but we made money.

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,320
<4-12,JAMAL ALHABI>阿米尔开车  轮班时把车租给别人开
<4-12,JAMAL ALHABI>Amir drove, and we rented shifts to other drivers.

101
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,240
<4-13,BECKETT>他们是谁
<4-13,BECKETT>And who were they?

<4-14,JAMAL ALHABI>Uh, Kevin Mccann and, uh, Dimitri Voldov.

103
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,110
<4-15,CASTLE>你不开车
<4-15,CASTLE>So you didn't drive the cab?

104
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,280
<4-16,JAMAL ALHABI>对我来说  出租车只是一种投资
<4-16,JAMAL ALHABI>For me, the taxi medallion was an investment.

105
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,670
<4-16,JAMAL ALHABI>我刚做起了新生意  开了个搬家公司
<4-16,JAMAL ALHABI>I just started a new business, a moving company.

106
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,160
<4-17,CASTLE>出租车管理协会并不会派发很多许可
<4-17,CASTLE>T.L.C. doesn't issue a lot of medallions.

107
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,310
<4-17,CASTLE>这可是一笔小财富
<4-17,CASTLE>It would've been worth a small fortune.

108
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,350
<4-17,CASTLE>谁继承阿米尔的股份
<4-17,CASTLE>So who inherits Amir's share?

109
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,530
<4-18,JAMAL ALHABI>纳兹哈  她需要这些
<4-18,JAMAL ALHABI>Nazihah will. She'll need it.

110
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,390
<4-19,BECKETT>不好意思  贝克特
<4-19,BECKETT>Excuse me. Beckett.

<5-1,ESPOSITO>V.I.N. number on the parts matches our cab.

114

<5-2,BECKETT>-琼斯现在哪  -审问室
<5-2,BECKETT>- Where's jones now? - Interrogation.

115
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,020
<5-4,LEMAN JONES>那些汽车配件是我捡的
<5-4,LEMAN JONES>I found those car parts.

116
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,270
<5-5,BECKETT>在被你偷的车上
<5-5,BECKETT>On the car that you stripped.

117
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,920
<5-5,BECKETT>我们有目击证人看到你了
<5-5,BECKETT>We have a witness who places you at the scene,

118
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,140
<5-5,BECKETT>所以别想再玩什么花样
<5-5,BECKETT>So please just stop with the lying.

119
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,990
<5-6,LEMAN JONES>目击证人
<5-6,LEMAN JONES>A witness?

120
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,660
<5-6,LEMAN JONES>我是偷了那辆车  我就是干这行的
<5-6,LEMAN JONES>Okay, I stripped that taxi. It's what I do.

121
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,880
<5-7,BECKETT>-在你杀死了司机后  -什么
<5-7,BECKETT>- After you killed the driver. - After I what?

122
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,080
<5-8,LEMAN JONES>不  我没杀人  因为里面根本没有人
<5-8,LEMAN JONES>No, I didn't kill any driver 'cause there was no driver.

123
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,350
<5-9,CASTLE>他被弃在仓库
<5-9,CASTLE>He was left in the warehouse.

124
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,450
<5-10,BECKETT>洗劫一空  一枪致命
<5-10,BECKETT>Robbed and shot in the head.

125
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,210
<5-11,LEMAN JONES>不是我干的
<5-11,LEMAN JONES>Well, not by me, okay?

126
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,570
<5-11,LEMAN JONES>我在开车  看到有一辆空车  我想
<5-11,LEMAN JONES>I was cruisin' and I saw the cab sitting empty, and I figure,

127
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,340
<5-11,LEMAN JONES>没理由让好零件废弃掉啊
<5-11,LEMAN JONES>no sense in letting good parts go to waste.

128
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,090
<5-12,BECKETT>当时什么时间
<5-12,BECKETT>What time was that?

129
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,230
<5-13,LEMAN JONES>不清楚  大概11点15分
<5-13,LEMAN JONES>I don't know. About 11:15 probably.

130
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,520
<5-15,CASTLE>正好是死者的死亡时间
<5-15,CASTLE>Well, there you go. That's right when he died.

131
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>听着  不是的  我不伤害别人
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>Look, no. I don't hurt people.

132
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,770
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>我只倒卖汽车
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>I'm just a car guy.

133
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,370
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>肯定是那个目击证人干的  一定是
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>Your witness must've done it. That's it.

134
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,960
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>他就是在那假装是无辜的路人
<5-16,LEMAN JONES>And now he's just playing innocent bystander or something.

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,450
<5-17,BECKETT>没有目击证人
<5-17,BECKETT>There was no witness.

136
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,980
<5-18,LEMAN JONES>你说什么
<5-18,LEMAN JONES>What do you mean?

137

<5-19,BECKETT>-我在吓唬你  -吓唬我
<5-19,BECKETT>- I was bluffing. - Bluffing?

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,970
<5-21,BECKETT>-对  -不
<5-21,BECKETT>- Yes. - No.

139
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,560
<5-22,LEMAN JONES>她有权这么做  真奇怪你竟然不知道
<5-22,LEMAN JONES>She's allowed to do that. I'm surprised you don't know that.

140
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,150
<5-24,LEMAN JONES>不  我是说当时有个人在那里
<5-24,LEMAN JONES>No, I mean there was a guy there.

141
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,240
<5-25,BECKETT>-我看见他了  -什么人  描述一下
<5-25,BECKETT>- I saw him. What guy? - Describe him.

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,390
<5-26,LEMAN JONES>我没看清  我停下车来  他就跑了
<5-26,LEMAN JONES>I didn't get a clear look. He ran off when I pulled up.

143
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,550
<5-26,LEMAN JONES>可是他当时在那
<5-26,LEMAN JONES>But he was there.

144
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,330
<5-26,LEMAN JONES>他在车里找什么东西
<5-26,LEMAN JONES>He was there looking for something in the car.

145
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,760
<5-27,CASTLE>为什么这么说
<5-27,CASTLE>What makes you say that?

146
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,340
<5-28,LEMAN JONES>他在车里毁坏了东西
<5-28,LEMAN JONES>Because he did a number on the interior.

147
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,950
<5-28,LEMAN JONES>他把内饰都撕破了
<5-28,LEMAN JONES>He tore up the upholstery.

148
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,480
<6-1,ESPOSITO>你认为他说实话了吗
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Think he's telling the truth?

149
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,320
<6-2,CASTLE>他还没那种临场发挥的本事
<6-2,CASTLE>That guy does not have the improv skills

150
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,870
<6-2,CASTLE>-编造这种谎言  -让鉴证组检查汽车
<6-2,CASTLE>- to make up a lie like that. - Have C.S.U. check the car

151
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,000
<6-3,BECKETT>-查找毁坏之处  -明白
<6-3,BECKETT>- for signs that someone else tampered with it. - You got it.

152
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,380
<6-5,BECKETT>不好意思  接个电话
<6-5,BECKETT>Uh... Sorry, you guys. I gotta get this.

154
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,270
<6-7,CASTLE>她怎么了
<6-7,CASTLE>What's going on with her?

155
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,010
<6-8,ESPOSITO>你知道她的  自己的事从来都闭口不谈
<6-8,ESPOSITO>You know Beckett. She plays it close to the vest.

156

<6-9,RYAN>我和一名从阿米尔那里
<6-9,RYAN>So I, uh, spoke

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,240
<6-10,CASTLE>-凯文·麦凯恩  -不  是另一个  德米特里·沃多夫
<6-10,CASTLE>- Kevin Mccann. - Uh, no, the other one-- Dimitri Voldov.

159

<6-10,CASTLE>他有不在场证据
<6-10,CASTLE>He alibied out,

160
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,070
<6-11,RYAN>不过有关麦凯恩他说了很多
<6-11,RYAN>but he had lots to say about Mccann.

161
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,230
<6-11,RYAN>麦凯恩和阿米尔两天前大吵了一架
<6-11,RYAN>Him and Amir got in a major fight two days ago.

162
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,340
<6-12,CASTLE>-为什么  -德米特里不知道
<6-12,CASTLE>- About what? - Well, Dimitri didn't know.

163
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,820
<6-13,RYAN>但是阿米尔说要开除他
<6-13,RYAN>But amir told him he was gonna fire Mccann.

164
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,080
<6-14,CASTLE>麦凯恩现在在哪
<6-14,CASTLE>And where's Mccann now?

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,670
<6-15,RYAN>在联盟出租车公司上班呢
<6-15,RYAN>Renting a shift at Allied Taxi

166

<6-17,RYAN>你吗  那最好了
<6-17,RYAN>Could you? That'd be best.

168
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,180
<7-1,KEVIN MCCANN>我们是吵过架  可这也没违法  对吗
<7-1,KEVIN MCCANN>Amir and I had words. No law against that, right?

169
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,100
<7-2,BECKETT>昨晚11点15分你在做什么

<7-3,KEVIN MCCANN>to the upper west. Why?

173
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,560
<7-4,BECKETT>那个时间阿米尔被杀害了
<7-4,BECKETT>Well, because that's when he was murdered.

174
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,330
<7-5,KEVIN MCCANN>开玩笑吧
<7-5,KEVIN MCCANN>Oh, you're kidding me.

<7-5,KEVIN MCCANN>听着  我没伤害过他
<7-5,KEVIN MCCANN>Look, I didn't lay a hand on that guy.

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,530
<7-6,CASTLE>两天前你们为什么打架
<7-6,CASTLE>Why did you and he fight two days ago?

177
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,200
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>因为他催我交租金
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>Because he was raping me on rent.

178
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,440
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>他负担的起的
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>Look, the guy could afford it.

179
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,810
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>他当时带着一大笔钱
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>He was flashing a roll that could choke a horse.

<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>有5000美元呢
<7-7,KEVIN MCCANN>Had 5 grand, easy.

<7-8,BECKETT>他经常带这么多钱在身上吗
<7-8,BECKETT>Wait. Was he known for carrying around that much money?

00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,920
<7-9,KEVIN MCCANN>我是第一次看见

<8-1,CASTLE>-他拿那么一大笔钱做什么用  -是埃斯波西托
<8-1,CASTLE>- what was he doing with that much cash? - It's Esposito.

<8-2,BECKETT>他需要我们俩马上回到犯罪现场
<8-2,BECKETT>He needs us back at the crime scene asap.

187
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,560
<9-1,ESPOSITO>记得里曼·琼斯说过是其他人
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Remember Leeman Jones said that some other dude

<9-3,ESPOSITO>鉴证组刚刚查明了原因
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Well, C.S.U. just figured out why.

190
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,620
<9-4,BECKETT>那辆车安装了摄像头
<9-4,BECKETT>The car had cameras.

<9-5,ESPOSITO>是针孔摄像头  还有麦克风
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Pinhole cameras, microphones, too.

192
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,030
<9-5,ESPOSITO>太好了  我们只要把带子倒到昨晚
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Great. All we have to do is rewind to last night,

<9-6,CASTLE>-看看是谁杀了他  案子就结了  -看不了了
<9-6,CASTLE>- see who was after him, case closed.- We can't.

194
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,450
<9-7,ESPOSITO>他们把装有视频资料的硬盘扯掉了
<9-7,ESPOSITO>They ripped out the hard drives with all the video data.

195
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,290
<9-8,BECKETT>这案子到底是怎么回事
<9-8,BECKETT>What the hell is going on here?

200
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,950
<10-1,CASTLE>奇怪的是  阿米尔的妻子
<10-1,CASTLE>Strange thing is, Amir's wife,

201
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,550
<10-1,CASTLE>他的表兄  还有其他司机们
<10-1,CASTLE>his cousin, other drivers--

202
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,220
<10-1,CASTLE>没有人知道他装了那些摄像头
<10-1,CASTLE>none of them knew that he'd installed those cameras.

203
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,840
<10-2,ALEXIS>也许阿米尔参加了一个真人秀
<10-2,ALEXIS>Maybe Amir was doing a reality show.

204
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,930
<10-3,CASTLE>没错  我也这么想  但结果并不是这样
<10-3,CASTLE>See, I thought that, too, but turns out, no.

205
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,110
<10-3,CASTLE>而且它们也不是执法部门要求安装的
<10-3,CASTLE>And they weren't installed by law enforcement either.

206
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,700
<10-4,ALEXIS>你觉得有人在监视他
<10-4,ALEXIS>You think someone was spying on him.

207
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,820
<10-5,CASTLE>或者是他的乘客  或者两者皆有
<10-5,CASTLE>Or his passengers, or both.

208
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,960
<10-5,CASTLE>也许就像《窃听大阴谋》里那样
<10-5,CASTLE>Maybe it's like in "The Conversation",

209
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,450
<10-5,CASTLE>他无意间窃听到了一场谋杀计划
<10-5,CASTLE>and he overheard a murder plot.

210
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,520
<10-5,CASTLE>不管怎样  那里面疑团不少
<10-5,CASTLE>Whatever it is, it's juicy.

211
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,790
<10-6,MARTHA>你有没有跟你爸说
<10-6,MARTHA>Have, you, uh, have you talked to your father

<10-6,MARTHA>-关于我们旅行的事  -还没有
<10-6,MARTHA>- about our little trip? - Not yet.

213
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,670
<10-8,MARTHA>那你还等什么呀
<10-8,MARTHA>Well, what are you waiting for?

214
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,460
<10-8,MARTHA>我在宁静绿洲成功地弄到了两个
<10-8,MARTHA>I have scored two incredibly-hard-to-get spots

215
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,920
<10-8,MARTHA>很难得到的位子
<10-8,MARTHA>at the oasis of serenity.

216
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,700
<10-9,CASTLE>很棒嘛
<10-9,CASTLE>That's fantastic.

217
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,990
<10-10,MARTHA>-那是什么  -你没听说过宁静绿洲吗
<10-10,MARTHA>- What is that? - You haven't heard of the serenity?

218
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,600
<10-11,ALEXIS>-是一个灵修度假村  -它坐落于卡茨基尔山脉
<10-11,ALEXIS>- It's a spiritual retreat.- Oh, it's nestled in the Catskills.

219
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,410
<10-12,MARTHA>它真是一座圣所  一个让人反思的地方
<10-12,MARTHA>It's a sanctuary, a place for reflection,

220
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,890
<10-12,MARTHA>和自己的内心交流
<10-12,MARTHA>getting in touch with your inner self.

221
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,350
<10-13,CASTLE>对你来说  那样做合适吗
<10-13,CASTLE>Well, in--in your case, is that wise?

222
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,490
<10-14,ALEXIS>奶奶为了准备
<10-14,ALEXIS>Gram wants to shed her ego

223
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,350
<10-14,ALEXIS>她的表演课程想要先摆脱自我
<10-14,ALEXIS>in preparation for teaching her acting classes.

224
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,000
<10-15,MARTHA>没错  做这种事和阿丽克西斯一起最好不过了

<11-14,ESPOSITO>I logged in to Amir's GPS account

261
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,360
<11-14,ESPOSITO>登陆了阿米尔的全球定位账户
<11-14,ESPOSITO>to track where he drove the day he died.

<11-16,ESPOSITO>at the same corner where Amir picked him up.

267
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,160
<11-16,ESPOSITO>谁会花三十美元只为了兜圈子
<11-16,ESPOSITO>Now who would pay 30 bucks to go in a circle?

<17-9,FARIQ YUSEF>- He's been murdered. - I am saddened to hear that.

331
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,870
<17-10,BECKETT>你在那辆出租车里坐了半小时
<17-10,BECKETT>You were in that cab for half an hour.

332
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,280
<17-10,BECKETT>你们俩到底是什么关系
<17-10,BECKETT>What's the nature of your relationship?

333
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,150
<17-11,FARIQ YUSEF>我有外交赦免权
<17-11,FARIQ YUSEF>I... I have diplomatic immunity.

334
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,630
<17-12,BECKETT>-你没有问问题...  -谁杀了他  是你吗
<17-12,BECKETT>- You have no standing questioning... - Who killed him? Was it you?

335
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,580
<17-14,BECKETT>-或拘留我的权力  -回答我的问题  是你杀了他吗
<17-14,BECKETT>- or detaining me. - Answer my question. Did you kill him?

336
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,610
<17-15,FARIQ YUSEF>我想要回我的手枪  麻烦你
<17-15,FARIQ YUSEF>I'd like my pistol, please.

337
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,280
<17-16,BECKETT>你可以来第12分局取
<17-16,BECKETT>You can collect it at the 12th precinct.

338
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,850
<17-17,FARIQ YUSEF>我会的
<17-17,FARIQ YUSEF>And so I shall.

339
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,700
<18-1,RYAN>法里克·尤瑟夫在领事馆的头衔是
<18-1,RYAN>Fariq Yusef's official title at the consulate

340
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
<18-1,RYAN>安全总管
<18-1,RYAN>is head of security.

341
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,630
<18-1,RYAN>他是一位秘密警察
<18-1,RYAN>He's a member of the secret police.

342
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,920
<18-2,CASTLE>他可能以前敲碎过别人的手指
<18-2,CASTLE>Well, he's probably broken a few fingers in his day.

343
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,850
<18-3,BECKETT>尤瑟夫有一把9毫米的手枪
<18-3,BECKETT>And Yusef also owned a 9-millimeter gun,

344
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,180
<18-3,BECKETT>正好和杀死阿米尔的是同一型号
<18-3,BECKETT>which was the same kind of gun that killed Amir.

345
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,990
<18-4,CASTLE>也许尤瑟夫将阿米尔招致麾下
<18-4,CASTLE>Maybe Yusef recruited Amir,

346
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,920
<18-4,CASTLE>让他从事秘密的谍报行动
<18-4,CASTLE>drew him in to the shadowy world of espionage.

347
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,700
<18-4,CASTLE>一旦他完成任务  他的命运便从此被尘封
<18-4,CASTLE>Once he finished his mission, his fate was sealed.

348
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,940
<18-4,CASTLE>尤瑟夫为了封口把他杀了  然后拿走了
<18-4,CASTLE>Yusef killed him to tie up loose ends, and then took

349
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,450
<18-4,CASTLE>揭露他们之间秘密关系的数据硬盘
<18-4,CASTLE>the data drive containing the explosive revelations.

350
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,350
<18-5,BECKETT>那关系具体是指什么
<18-5,BECKETT>And that would be what exactly?

351
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,580
<18-6,CASTLE>我依然在构思那部分  但这的确合情合理
<18-6,CASTLE>I'm still thinking on that. But it's a perfect fit.

352
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,920
<18-7,ESPOSITO>没错  除非法里克·尤瑟夫并不是凶手
<18-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, except that Fariq Yusef isn't the killer.

353
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,440
<18-8,CASTLE>你确定吗  因为那会毁掉一个十分完美的假设
<18-8,CASTLE>Are you sure? Because that would ruin a perfectly good theory.

354
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,160
<18-9,ESPOSITO>我确定  阿米尔被杀的那天晚上
<18-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah. The night Amir was killed,

355
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,050
<18-9,ESPOSITO>法里克和叙利亚大使在一起
<18-9,ESPOSITO>Fariq was with the Syrian ambassador

356
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,860
<18-9,ESPOSITO>在贝内特球场看球赛
<18-9,ESPOSITO>at a soccer game at Bennett field.

357
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,390
<18-9,ESPOSITO>网上有照片可以证明
<18-9,ESPOSITO>There are photos online to prove it.

358
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,460
<18-10,BECKETT>这又让我们回到了原点
<18-10,BECKETT>Which brings us back to square one.

359
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,490
<18-10,BECKETT>好吧  阿米尔和尤瑟夫去了曼哈顿南区转了一圈
<18-10,BECKETT>Okay, so Amir and Yusef take a tour of lower Manhattan,

360
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,050
<18-10,BECKETT>不久后的那天夜里
<18-10,BECKETT>and then later on that same night,

361
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,450
<18-10,BECKETT>他打给妻子  说他还在工作
<18-10,BECKETT>He calls his wife, tells her that he's still working,

362
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,960
<18-10,BECKETT>其实是去了华盛顿高地
<18-10,BECKETT>and instead, went up to Washington Heights.

363
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,560
<18-11,ESPOSITO>接着死在仓库里
<18-11,ESPOSITO>Then he ends up dead at the warehouse

364
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,740
<18-11,ESPOSITO>数据硬盘也被破坏了
<18-11,ESPOSITO>with the data drive ripped out.

365
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,820
<18-11,ESPOSITO>C4121652
<18-11,ESPOSITO>C4121652.

366
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,460
<18-12,CASTLE>阿米尔开车到圣尼古拉斯大街1600号
<18-12,CASTLE>Amir took his cab down St. Nicholas ave to the 1600 block.

367
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,920
<18-12,CASTLE>他停在大街上
<18-12,CASTLE>He parked mid-block.

368
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,570
<18-12,CASTLE>所以呢
<18-12,CASTLE>so?

369
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,230
<18-13,CASTLE>所以我在想
<18-13,CASTLE>So I'm just thinking,

370
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,760
<18-13,CASTLE>C4121652中的1652是个地址
<18-13,CASTLE>The 1652 part of C4121652 is an address.

371
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,720
<18-13,CASTLE>圣尼古拉斯大街1652号是什么地方
<18-13,CASTLE>What's at St. Nicholas Ave. At 1652?

372
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,800
<18-14,RYAN>北曼哈顿仓库
<18-14,RYAN>North Manhattan Storage.

373
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,650
<18-15,BECKETT>C412是个储存室
<18-15,BECKETT>C412 is a storage unit.

374
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,550
<19-1,CASTLE>谋杀  政治阴谋
<19-1,CASTLE>Murder, political intrigue,

375
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,330
<19-1,CASTLE>金钱交易  现在又有神秘储存室
<19-1,CASTLE>cash payments, and now a mysterious storage locker?

376
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,470
<19-1,CASTLE>太棒了
<19-1,CASTLE>Oh, this is too good.

377
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,180
<19-1,CASTLE>等等  我们怎么打开呢
<19-1,CASTLE>Wait. How are we gonna get it open?

378
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,530
<19-2,BECKETT>无计可施时
<19-2,BECKETT>well, if all else fails...

379
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,070
<19-3,CASTLE>我都不好意思提起
<19-3,CASTLE>For reasons too disturbing to mention,

380
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,400
<19-3,CASTLE>这太火辣了
<19-3,CASTLE>I-I find that hot.

381
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,660
<19-3,CASTLE>或者
<19-3,CASTLE>Or...

382
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,860
<19-4,BECKETT>我从阿米尔的物品中拿了钥匙
<19-4,BECKETT>I grabbed Amir's keys from property,

383
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,390
<19-4,BECKETT>希望这是他的储存室
<19-4,BECKETT>so hopefully this is his locker.

384
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,030
<19-5,CASTLE>的确是  你觉得里面会有什么呢
<19-5,CASTLE>Which it is. What do you think's in there?

385
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,320
<19-6,BECKETT>不知道  也许空无一物  就像黑手党老大的金库
<19-6,BECKETT>I don't know. Might be empty, like Al Capone's Vault.

386
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,950
<19-7,CASTLE>不是吧  想想在这个情形下
<19-7,CASTLE>Oh, no. Think of all the amazing things

387
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,750
<19-7,CASTLE>在储存室里找到的那些财宝吧
<19-7,CASTLE>that are found in storage units at times like this.

388
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,680
<19-7,CASTLE>约柜  琼斯博士[《夺宝奇兵》情节]
<19-7,CASTLE>The Arc of the Covenant, Dr. Jones?

389
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,380
<19-8,CASTLE>约柜在一个板条箱里
<19-8,CASTLE>Well, the Arc of the Covenant was in a crate.

390
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,110
<19-9,BECKETT>塑性炸药
<19-9,BECKETT>Plastic explosives.

391
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
<19-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  快走  快走
<19-10,BECKETT>Castle, get out! Get out!

392
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,990
<19-11,CASTLE>什么
<19-11,CASTLE>What?

393
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,300
<19-13,CASTLE>-快走  - 为什么  我不
<19-13,CASTLE>- Go! - Why? What--I don't--

394
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,160
<19-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  快离开这里  快走
<19-14,BECKETT>Castle, back away from the door! Get away!

395
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,950
<19-15,CASTLE>发生什么事  那是什么  凯特
<19-15,CASTLE>What is going on? What is that thing, Kate?

396
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,420
<19-16,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特探长  警员编号0334
<19-16,BECKETT>This is detective Kate Beckett, badge number 0-3-3-4.

397
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,900
<19-16,BECKETT>我受到高强度的辐射
<19-16,BECKETT>I've been exposed to high levels of radiation.

398
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,180
<19-16,BECKETT>我们需要紧急救助
<19-16,BECKETT>We need emergency services right away.

399
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,980
<20-1,CASTLE>各位  你们不能
<20-1,CASTLE>Guys, you can't just--

400
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,380
<20-1,CASTLE>你们不能  告诉我这到底有多严重
<20-1,CASTLE>You can't--just at least tell me how serious it is!

401
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,110
<20-1,CASTLE>-他们遭辐射有多严重  -不知道
<20-1,CASTLE>- How badly did they get hit?  - We don't know.

402
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,580
<21-1,RYAN>但帮助他们的最佳方法
<21-1,RYAN>But the best way for us to help them

403
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,500
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>就是继续调查这案子
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>is to keep working on this case.

404
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,720
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>被害人拥有这个储存室的钥匙
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>Now our murder victim had a key to this storage unit,

405
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,230
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>他远不止出租司机那么简单
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>so he was into a lot more than driving a taxi.

406
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,640
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>深入调查阿米尔·阿哈比
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>Dig deep into Amir Alhabi.

407
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,640
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>带他妻子和表兄过来
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>Let's get his wife and his cousin in here.

408
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,510
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>同时  我会致电叙利亚领事馆
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>Meanwhile, I'll call the Syrian consulate and find out

409
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,110
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>查查阿米尔与安全主管联系的原因
<21-2,MONTGOMERY>why Amir had contact with the head of security.

410
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,240
<21-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>他们不会跟你们谈的
<21-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>They won't talk to you.

411
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,640
<21-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>不管阿哈比涉及什么事件
<21-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Whatever Alhabi was into,

412
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,430
<21-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>叙利亚领事馆都不想受牵连
<21-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>the Syrians don't want it blowing back on 'em.

413
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,590
<21-4,MONTGOMERY>请原谅  阁下是
<21-4,MONTGOMERY>Excuse me. Who are you?

414
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,610
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>你一定是蒙哥马利队长
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>You must be Captain Montgomery.

415
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,920
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>我是马克·法伦  录属国土安全局
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'm Mark Fallon, Department of Homeland Security.

416
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,820
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>国土安全局派我到这里作联络人
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>D.H.S. Sent me down here to act as a liaison.

417
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,160
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>我听说你这里出状况了
<21-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>I understand you have a situation.

418
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,020
<22-1,CASTLE>危险品紧急处理小组
<22-1,CASTLE>Those hazmat teams?

419
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,350
<22-1,CASTLE>他们每次行动
<22-1,CASTLE>They're only staying in the building

420
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,790
<22-1,CASTLE>只在大楼里停留一分钟
<22-1,CASTLE>for about a minute at a time.

421
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,730
<22-2,BECKETT>也许只是标准程序
<22-2,BECKETT>Maybe it's just standard protocol.

422
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,700
<22-3,CASTLE>是的  也许那里太危险处理不了
<22-3,CASTLE>Yeah. Maybe it's just too hot in there to handle.

423
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,060
<22-3,CASTLE>你的辐射探测器
<22-3,CASTLE>That radiation detector of yours,

424
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,960
<22-3,CASTLE>上面有刻度吗
<22-3,CASTLE>does it have a scale on it.

425
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
<22-3,CASTLE>是胸透X光级别还是核电站泄露的级别
<22-3,CASTLE>You know, like chest x-ray to Chernobyl?

426
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,140
<22-4,BECKETT>最大值了
<22-4,BECKETT>Maxed out.

427
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,390
<22-4,BECKETT>我们要假设阿哈比不是一个人在行动
<22-4,BECKETT>We have to assume Alhabi wasn't acting alone.

428
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,750
<23-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>他妻子和表兄在哪里
<23-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where are we on his wife and cousin?

429
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,660
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>她正过来
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>She's on her way in.

430
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,180
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>据邻居讲  杰马尔出去喝酒了
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>According to a neighbor, Jamal went out drinking.

431
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,360
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>我们正设法找到他
<23-2,MONTGOMERY>We're trying to track him down.

432
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,440
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>这些核原料不是阿米尔自己的
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Amir either had the nuclear material for himself

433
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,980
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>就是他为别人保管的
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>or he was holding on to it for someone else.

434
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,030
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>不管怎样  这就是他被杀的原因
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Either way, odds are, that's what got him killed.

435
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,510
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>将他通话记录和恐怖监测名单进行交叉对比
<23-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Check his phone records against the terror watch list.

436
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,850
<23-4,MONTGOMERY>我们已经着手调查了  请原谅
<23-4,MONTGOMERY>We're already doing that. Excuse me.

437
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,630
<23-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>只想弄清楚
<23-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>Just so I'm clear,

438
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,070
<23-6,MONTGOMERY>你要全面接管吗
<23-6,MONTGOMERY>are you taking over?

439
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,560
<23-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>这是你的案子
<23-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>This is your case.

440
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,700
<23-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>我只是来尽力协助的
<23-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'm just here to lend support however I can.

441
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,120
<23-8,ESPOSITO>队长  移民和海关执法局刚发来
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Yo, cap, I.C.E. Just sent over

442
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,720
<23-8,ESPOSITO>阿米尔·阿哈比的移民文件
<23-8,ESPOSITO>the immigration papers for Amir Alhabi.

443
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,240
<23-8,ESPOSITO>他在大马士革一所学校
<23-8,ESPOSITO>He got a degree in electrical engineering

444
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,500
<23-8,ESPOSITO>获得了电子机械学位
<23-8,ESPOSITO>from a school in Damascus.

445
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,780
<23-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>-他在叙利亚从事什么  -刚得知
<23-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>- What was he working on in Syria?  - I got that one.

446
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,800
<23-10,RYAN>我刚跟国务院的人通过话
<23-10,RYAN>I just spoke with the state department.

447
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,230
<23-10,RYAN>阿米尔第一次入境的时候他们盘问过他
<23-10,RYAN>They debriefed Amir when he first landed here.

448
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,970
<23-10,RYAN>他正在从事叙利亚武器项目的工作
<23-10,RYAN>They say he was working on a weapons program for the Syrians.

449
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,400
<23-11,MONTGOMERY>核武器吗
<23-11,MONTGOMERY>Nuclear weapons?

450
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,990
<23-12,RYAN>-是的  -好吧
<23-12,RYAN>- Yeah.  - Okay.

451
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,410
<23-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>现在由我接管
<23-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>Now I'm taking over.

452
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,090
<24-1,CASTLE>是个炸弹
<24-1,CASTLE>It's a bomb.

453
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,840
<24-1,CASTLE>那储存室里有个核弹
<24-1,CASTLE>There's a nuclear bomb in that locker.

454
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,560
<24-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们不知道是个炸弹
<24-2,BECKETT>Castle, we don't know that it's a bomb.

455
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,040
<24-3,CASTLE>一爆炸我们就知道了
<24-3,CASTLE>Well, we will as soon as it goes off,

456
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,100
<24-3,CASTLE>在我们气化前的十亿分之一秒
<24-3,CASTLE>in that nanosecond before we're vaporized.

457
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,170
<24-3,CASTLE>对不起
<24-3,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

458
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,330
<24-3,CASTLE>作家的职业病犯了
<24-3,CASTLE>It's just the--the writer in me

459
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,870
<24-3,CASTLE>总想到最坏的场景
<24-3,CASTLE>going to worst-case scenario.

460
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,870
<24-4,BECKETT>-能说点别的吗  -好的
<24-4,BECKETT>- Can we just talk about something else?  - Yeah.

461
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,880
<24-5,CASTLE>乔什怎样了
<24-5,CASTLE>How's Josh?

462
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,090
<24-5,CASTLE>还好
<24-5,CASTLE>Fine.

463
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,410
<24-6,BECKETT>他
<24-6,BECKETT>He's, um...

464
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,930
<24-6,BECKETT>他正在前往海地的路上
<24-6,BECKETT>He's on his way to Haiti

465
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,430
<24-6,BECKETT>又去做无国界医生
<24-6,BECKETT>to do another doctors without borders mission.

466
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,370
<24-7,CASTLE>要去多久
<24-7,CASTLE>How long?

467
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,610
<24-7,CASTLE>我不知道
<24-7,CASTLE>I don't know.

468
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,330
<24-8,BECKETT>真可笑  卡塞尔
<24-8,BECKETT>It's so funny, Castle.

469
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,260
<24-8,BECKETT>一开始  我喜欢他忙碌的身影
<24-8,BECKETT>You know, at first, I loved that he was so busy.

470
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,650
<24-8,BECKETT>只是
<24-8,BECKETT>It just, um...

471
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,910
<24-8,BECKETT>这给了我迈出一步的机会
<24-8,BECKETT>Just gave me an opportunity to keep one foot out the door,

472
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:39,760
<24-8,BECKETT>以防万一
<24-8,BECKETT>Just in case.

473
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,460
<24-9,CASTLE>但只迈出一步
<24-9,CASTLE>But with one foot out the door,

474
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,760
<24-9,CASTLE>很难知道自己的立场在哪
<24-9,CASTLE>it's hard to know where you stand.

475
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,430
<24-10,BECKETT>即使我迈出一步  又有什么意义呢
<24-10,BECKETT>And even if I did, I mean, what does it mean?

476
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,510
<24-10,BECKETT>他在那里救死扶伤
<24-10,BECKETT>He's out there. He's saving people.

477
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,590
<24-10,BECKETT>要我怎么跟那去比呢
<24-10,BECKETT>How do you even compete with that?

478
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,650
<24-11,CASTLE>没法比  任何人都比不上
<24-11,CASTLE>You can't. No. No one can.

479
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,480
<24-12,BECKETT>这也正是当初他吸引我的地方
<24-12,BECKETT>That's one of the things that attracted me to him the most--

480
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,960
<24-12,BECKETT>热情
<24-12,BECKETT>that... passion,

481
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,640
<24-12,BECKETT>干劲
<24-12,BECKETT>that drive.

482
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,700
<24-12,BECKETT>为什么对方身上吸引你的特质
<24-12,BECKETT>Why is it that the thing that attracts you to a person

483
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,740
<24-12,BECKETT>最终总是变成让你抓狂的特质呢
<24-12,BECKETT>always ends up being that thing that just drives you crazy?

484
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,250
<24-12,BECKETT>我只希望
<24-12,BECKETT>I just wish that...

485
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,690
<24-12,BECKETT>我希望找到一个可以守候我的人
<24-12,BECKETT>I wish that I had someone who would be there for me,

486
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,130
<24-12,BECKETT>我可以守候他
<24-12,BECKETT>and I could be there for him,

487
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,110
<24-12,BECKETT>两人可以长相厮守
<24-12,BECKETT>and we could just dive into it together.

488
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,820
<24-13,HAZMAT SPECIALIST>你们可以走了
<24-13,HAZMAT SPECIALIST>You're free to go.

489
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,560
<24-14,CASTLE>可以吗
<24-14,CASTLE>Uh, we are?

490
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,050
<24-15,BECKETT>辐射怎么办
<24-15,BECKETT>What about the radiation?

491
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,130
<24-16,HAZMAT SPECIALIST>我们在储存室里发现了放射性钴60残留
<24-16,HAZMAT SPECIALIST>We found residual traces of cobalt-60 in the storage unit.

492
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,660
<24-16,HAZMAT SPECIALIST>还不足以对健康构成威胁
<24-16,HAZMAT SPECIALIST>Not enough to cause any health problems.

493
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,000
<24-17,MONTGOMERY>贝克特探长  卡塞尔
<24-17,MONTGOMERY>Detective Beckett, Castle.

494
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,460
<24-17,MONTGOMERY>你们没事  我们真是太高兴了
<24-17,MONTGOMERY>We're all real glad you two are okay.

495
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,430
<24-18,BECKETT>谢谢长官  我们也很高兴  我很困惑
<24-18,BECKETT>Thanks, sir. So are we. I'm confused, though.

496
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,750
<24-18,BECKETT>这是虚惊一场吗
<24-18,BECKETT>Is this just a false alarm?

497
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,600
<24-19,MONTGOMERY>不全是  如果你们还撑得住
<24-19,MONTGOMERY>Well, not exactly. If you're up to it,

498
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,970
<24-19,MONTGOMERY>我们真的需要你们协助调查
<24-19,MONTGOMERY>we really could use you back at the precinct.

499
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,640
<24-19,MONTGOMERY>详情路上再说
<24-19,MONTGOMERY>I can fill you in on the way.

500
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,030
<24-20,CASTLE>那些钴60是哪里来的
<24-20,CASTLE>Those traces of cobalt-60, where did they come from?

501
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,210
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>我们认为储存室里还有一个板条箱
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>We think there was a second crate at the storage unit,

502
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,480
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>装有大量的钴60
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>which contained large quantities of cobalt-60.

503
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,550
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>找到的电线和连接器
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>We found wire and crimp-on connectors, which leads us

504
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,120
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>使我们相信那个箱子装满炸药
<24-21,MONTGOMERY>to believe the crate was outfitted with explosives.

505
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,720
<24-22,BECKETT>炸弹
<24-22,BECKETT>A bomb?

506
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,350
<24-23,MONTGOMERY>核弹
<24-23,MONTGOMERY>A dirty bomb.

507
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,490
<24-24,BECKETT>现在在何处
<24-24,BECKETT>Where is it now?

508
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,730
<24-25,MONTGOMERY>这正是我们要找的
<24-25,MONTGOMERY>That's what we're trying to find out.

509
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,160
<25-1,ALEXIS>爸爸  干到这么晚吗
<25-1,ALEXIS>Hey, dad. Late night?

510
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,530

<25-2,CASTLE>Uh, still going. I just came back to change my clothes.

<25-3,MARTHA>那再见了
<25-3,MARTHA>Well, bid my ego adieu.

512

<25-3,MARTHA>我要去绿洲了  阿丽克西斯不能去  多亏你了
<25-3,MARTHA>I am off to the oasis, minus Alexis, thanks to you.

<25-4,CASTLE>-其实我改主意了  -是吗
<25-4,CASTLE>- Actually, I changed my mind about that.  - You have?

514
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,600
<25-5,MARTHA>你改了
<25-5,MARTHA>You have?

515
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,700
<25-7,CASTLE>是的  我觉得你们一起相处很重要
<25-7,CASTLE>Yeah. I think it's important you have time together.

516
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,240
<25-8,MARTHA>我对你刮目相看
<25-8,MARTHA>Oh, my faith in you is restored.

517
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,450
<25-9,ALEXIS>爸爸  我的物理考试怎么办  我不能走
<25-9,ALEXIS>Dad, what about my physics test? I can't just leave.

518

<25-10,CASTLE>你可以的  带上它们
<25-10,CASTLE>Yeah, sure you can. Just take 'em with you.

519
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,780
<25-11,ALEXIS>我还没有收拾呢  我不能
<25-11,ALEXIS>I haven't packed or anything. I can't--

520
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,260
<25-12,MARTHA>亲爱的  那里什么都有的
<25-12,MARTHA>Honey, everything is provided there.

521

<25-12,MARTHA>我们会玩得很开心的
<25-12,MARTHA>Oh, we're going to have so much fun.

522
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,510
<25-12,MARTHA>快点  我去拿个包
<25-12,MARTHA>Come on. Let's get a bag.

523
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,080
<25-13,CASTLE>去吧  这对你有好处
<25-13,CASTLE>Go. It'll be-- it'll be good for you.

524
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,840
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>鉴于这件案子的特殊性
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>Due to the nature of this case,

525
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,410
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>我要提醒各位  不要和任何人谈论此事
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>let me remind you not to discuss it with anyone,

526
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,600
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>和家人也不能说
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>not even family.

527
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,280
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>我们不能泄露消息引起恐慌
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>We can't afford to have word leak out and cause a panic.

528
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,930
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>这案子由法伦探员接管
<26-1,MONTGOMERY>Let me turn this over to agent Fallon.

529
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,080
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>谢谢  队长  好吧  各位
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>Thank you, captain. All right, folks.

530
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,470
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>目前所知的是  阿米尔·阿哈比在C412号储存室
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>Here's what we know-- Amir Alhabi built a bomb

531
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,330
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>制作了一个炸弹
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>in storage unit C412.

532
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,240
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>这是枚核弹  用来引爆
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's a dirty bomb, designed to explode

533
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,210
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>并散射高放射性钴60
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>and disperse highly radioactive cobalt-60...

534
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,630
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>那枚炸弹不见了
<26-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>And that bomb is missing...

535
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,280
<26-3,RYAN>我打电话给珍妮告诉她我会晚到
<26-3,RYAN>I called Jenny to tell her I'd be late.

536
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,140
<26-3,RYAN>劝她去她妈妈那里
<26-3,RYAN>Tried to get her to go visit her Mom.

537
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,220
<26-4,ESPOSITO>我也跟蕾妮说了类似的话
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I did the same thing with Lanie.

538
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,070
<26-4,ESPOSITO>没用的  她恨她妈妈
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Didn't work. She hates her Mom.

539
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,540
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>找员工谈谈  查一下监控录像
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>... interview facility employees, check surveillance video,

540
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,180
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>具体情况大家都清楚
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>You know the drill.

541
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,270
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>只要找到了取走炸弹的人
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>We find the person who moved the bomb,

542
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,870
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>就能很快找到炸弹在哪儿
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>we'll find where it is.

543
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,310
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>行动起来
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>Let's get on it.

544
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,050
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>卡塞尔先生
<26-6,AGENT MARK FALLON>Mr. Castle.

545
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,630
<26-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>我对您在此案中的优秀表现表示感谢
<26-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'd like to thank you for your fine work on this case.

546
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,630
<26-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>但我不能派市民冲锋陷阵
<26-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>However, I can't have civilians on the front lines.

547
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,670
<26-8,CASTLE>感觉就像是
<26-8,CASTLE>It's as though I'm getting a raise

548
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,050
<26-8,CASTLE>在升职的同时被炒了鱿鱼
<26-8,CASTLE>and getting fired at the same time.

549
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,700
<26-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>关键是  这并不是你的工作
<26-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Except for, you don't actually work here.

550
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,210
<26-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>这是为你的安全着想
<26-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's for your own protection.

551
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,550
<26-10,CASTLE>我在政府的朋友
<26-10,CASTLE>Well, my friend the governor

552
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,770
<26-10,CASTLE>听到这话肯定很失望
<26-10,CASTLE>will be very disappointed to hear it.

553
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,590
<26-10,CASTLE>好吧
<26-10,CASTLE>Okay.

554
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,480
<26-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>尽量别碍事
<26-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>Just try and stay out of the way.

555
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,000
<26-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>贝克特探长  说句话
<26-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>Detective Beckett, a word.

556
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,280
<26-12,CASTLE>他不信我
<26-12,CASTLE>He doesn't trust me.

557
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,510
<26-13,MONTGOMERY>他不信任何人
<26-13,MONTGOMERY>Or anyone else.

558
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,150
<26-13,MONTGOMERY>工作本质使然
<26-13,MONTGOMERY>Nature of the job.

559
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,130
<26-14,CASTLE>我能做什么
<26-14,CASTLE>So how can I help?

560
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,070
<27-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>阿米尔的妻子...
<27-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Amir's wife...

561
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,890
<27-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>她在传讯中表现如何
<27-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>How did she seem during the interview?

562
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,630
<27-2,BECKETT>跟所有刚失去丈夫的女人一样
<27-2,BECKETT>Like a woman who had just lost her husband.

563
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,540
<27-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>她看上去可信吗
<27-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Did she appear truthful?

564
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,630
<27-4,BECKETT>当时的确很可信
<27-4,BECKETT>Mm-hmm, at the time she did.

565
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,650
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>我要你跟我一起进去
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'm gonna want you in there with me, okay?

566
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,670
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>要让她见到熟人  这很重要
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>I think it's important she sees a friendly face.

567
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,210
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>如果我过火了  你就拉我回来
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>If I go over the line, you just reel me back in.

568
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,710
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>是个不错的切入点
<27-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>That's a nice touch.

569
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,640
<27-6,BECKETT>什么
<27-6,BECKETT>What?

570
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,840
<27-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>那个孩子
<27-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>The baby.

571
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,430
<28-1,BECKETT>纳兹哈  这位是法伦探员
<28-1,BECKETT>Nazihah, this is agent Fallon.

572
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,250
<28-2,NAZIHAH ALHABI>阿米尔的案子有新消息吗
<28-2,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Do you have news about Amir's case?

573
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,600
<28-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>事实上  有新消息
<28-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>As a matter of fact, I do.

574
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,080
<28-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>阿米尔账户里的一万美金是通过汇款存入的
<28-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>That $10,000 was wired into Amir's account.

575
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,150
<29-1,CASTLE>就是说可以追查来源  打开资金追踪数据库
<29-1,CASTLE>Which means it can be traced. Pull up the trakfund database

576
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,570
<29-2,RYAN>输入银行账号和路径
<29-2,RYAN>and put in the routing and account numbers.

577
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,990
<29-3,RYAN>刚把C412号储存室过去48小时
<29-3,RYAN>Whoa. Just downloaded footage of unit C412

578
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,240
<29-3,RYAN>录像下载下来
<29-3,RYAN>for the last 48.

579
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,650
<29-3,RYAN>希望这个时段拍到有人去过那里
<29-3,RYAN>Hopefully that's when somebody stopped by.

580
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,580
<29-4,CASTLE>阿拉伯恐怖分子  谁信啊
<29-4,CASTLE>An Arab terrorist. Who'd believe it?

581
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,930
<29-5,ESPOSITO>老兄  反过来想
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Think back, bro.

582
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,960
<29-6,CASTLE>我就是这意思  已经想过了
<29-6,CASTLE>That's my point. It's been done.

583
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,520
<29-7,RYAN>-可靠可信  -这次不是
<29-7,RYAN>- Which means it's tried and true. - Not this time.

584
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,520
<29-8,ESPOSITO>也许跟我们想的不一样
<29-8,ESPOSITO>Maybe it's not what we think.

585
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,670
<29-9,CASTLE>那一万美金由一个叫詹姆斯·史密斯的人
<29-9,CASTLE>That $10,000 that was wired in, it's from a bank

586
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,810
<29-9,CASTLE>从密歇根州迪尔伯恩的银行汇来
<29-9,CASTLE>in Dearborn, Michigan, from a James Smith.

587
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,350
<29-10,ESPOSITO>这名字在美国一抓一大把  八成是假名
<29-10,ESPOSITO>That's the most common name in America. It's probably bogus.

588
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,800
<29-11,RYAN>再说迪尔波恩有很多中东人
<29-11,RYAN>Plus, there's a major middle-eastern population in Dearborn.

589
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,280
<29-12,CASTLE>就在转账前四分钟
<29-12,CASTLE>Four minutes before it was transferred out,

590
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,020
<29-12,CASTLE>这笔钱由詹姆斯·史密斯
<29-12,CASTLE>it was transferred in from...

591
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,850
<29-12,CASTLE>从德州南方银行转出
<29-12,CASTLE>James Smith, Texas Southern bank.

592
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,140
<29-13,RYAN>汇出这一万美金的人利用多家银行
<29-13,RYAN>Whoever sent that 10 grand covered his tracks

593
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,300
<29-13,RYAN>反复转汇的方法躲避追踪
<29-13,RYAN>by daisy-chaining the money through different banks.

594
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,230
<29-14,CASTLE>我能找到就说明藏得不太好
<29-14,CASTLE>Didn't cover them that well if I can follow them.

595
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,300
<29-15,ESPOSITO>我打赌阿米尔的妻子身上有线索
<29-15,ESPOSITO>Well, I bet Amir's wife could shed some light

596
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,630
<29-15,ESPOSITO>希望法伦能
<29-15,ESPOSITO>and I hope that Fallon's going

598
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,690
<29-15,ESPOSITO>-像杰克·鲍尔那样给力  -也许她不知道
<29-15,ESPOSITO>- all Jack Bauer on her ass. - Maybe she didn't know.

599
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,670
<29-17,ESPOSITO>他们是一伙的  老兄
<29-17,ESPOSITO>They were together, bro.

600
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,470
<29-17,ESPOSITO>要是你是恐怖分子  珍妮会不知道吗
<29-17,ESPOSITO>Could you be a terrorist without Jenny knowing?

601
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,710
<30-1,NAZIHAH ALHABI>阿米尔不是恐怖分子  他爱他的国家
<30-1,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Amir was not a terrorist. He loved this country.

602
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,470
<30-2,BECKETT>但他却持有...
<30-2,BECKETT>And yet he was in possession of...

603
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,760
<30-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>阿哈比夫人  炸弹在哪里
<30-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where's the bomb, Mrs. Alhabi?

604
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,400
<30-4,NAZIHAH ALHABI>告诉你了  我不知道炸弹的事
<30-4,NAZIHAH ALHABI>I told you, I know nothing about a bomb.

605
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,160
<30-4,NAZIHAH ALHABI>阿米尔不会做这种事的  他没理由
<30-4,NAZIHAH ALHABI>Amir would never do such a thing. Why would he?

606
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,710
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>他需要钱  你的孩子需要用钱
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>He needed the cash. That baby of yours is a money pit.

607
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,160
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>账单越积越厚
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>The bills started piling up,

608
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,370
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>他入错了伙
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>and he got in bed with the wrong people.

609
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,890
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>我希望你告诉我他们是谁
<30-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>I need you to tell me who they were.

610
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,570
<30-6,NAZIHAH ALHABI>我发誓我不知道
<30-6,NAZIHAH ALHABI>I swear to you, I don't know.

611
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,870
<30-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>你怎么会不知道
<30-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>How can you not know

612
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,060
<30-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>跟你同床共枕的男人是个恐怖分子
<30-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>the man you're sharing your bed with is a terrorist?

613
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,850
<30-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>你也是同谋
<30-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>You're a part of this!

614
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,880
<30-8,NAZIHAH ALHABI>我没什么好掩藏的
<30-8,NAZIHAH ALHABI>I have nothing to hide.

<30-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>等我找到了  就把你当做关键证人关起来
<30-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>And when I do, I'm gonna lock you up as a material witness

617

<30-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>-把那孩子送到寄养所去  -你不能那么做
<30-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>- and send that baby off to foster care. - No, you can't do that.

<30-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>Oh, yes, I can. Watch me.

619

<30-12,BECKETT>先生  我能跟你谈谈吗
<30-12,BECKETT>Sir, can I talk to you?

620
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,690
<30-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>-不  来  跟你女儿吻别吧  -求求你
<30-13,AGENT MARK FALLON>- No. Go ahead. Kiss your daughter good-bye. - Please.

<30-19,AGENT MARK FALLON>"诚实"  是它在阿拉伯语里的意思吧
<30-19,AGENT MARK FALLON>"Honesty", is that what it means in Arabic?

<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>还觉得她可信吗
<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>Still think she's truthful?

<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>我想听听你的意见
<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>I just want your opinion.

644
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,230
<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>可信不可信
<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>Truthful or no?

645
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,370
<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>可信
<30-27,AGENT MARK FALLON>Yes.

646
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,190
<30-28,BECKETT>但我的行动还是
<30-28,BECKETT>But I still have to operate

647
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,880
<30-28,BECKETT>要建立在她说谎的假设下进行
<30-28,BECKETT>under the assumption that she's lying.

648
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,820
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>她接受审讯的时候  我拿到了国家安全许可
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>While she was in here, I pulled a national security certificate.

649
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,010
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>她的房子被监听
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>Her house has just been bugged.

650
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,600
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>她会受到全天候监控
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>She'll be under surveillance 24/7.

651
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,480
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>如果她有所隐瞒  我们会发现的
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>If she's hiding something, we'll find it.

652
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,270
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>让她以为我相信她说的是实话
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's important that she believes

653
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,700
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>这才是重点
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>I think she's telling the truth.

654
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,180
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>你做的很好
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>You did good.

655
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,740
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>她把你当做盟友
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>She considers you an ally.

656
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,260
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>这点回头会很有用
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>That could be helpful later.

657
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,540
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>多谢配合  贝克特
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>Thanks for playing, Beckett.

658
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,870
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>阿米尔收到的那笔钱
<30-29,AGENT MARK FALLON>That money that Amir received

659
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,710
<31-1,CASTLE>总共经过六家银行  但最初是从
<31-1,CASTLE>was wired through six banks, but originated in

660
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,800
<31-1,CASTLE>阿富汗汇出的
<31-1,CASTLE>Afghanistan.

661
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,770
<31-2,RYAN>你和贝克特到达前
<31-2,RYAN>Whoa. Got a visitor at C412

662
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,050
<31-2,RYAN>六小时有人去过C412号储存室
<31-2,RYAN>six hours before you and Beckett got there.

663
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,780
<31-3,ESPOSITO>这就是我们苦苦寻找的突破
<31-3,ESPOSITO>This is the break we've been looking for.

664
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,330
<31-4,RYAN>那箱子看上去挺沉
<31-4,RYAN>That crate looks heavy.

665
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,130
<31-5,CASTLE>四周全是铅制护板
<31-5,CASTLE>It's all the lead shielding.

666
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,310
<31-5,CASTLE>那是阿米尔的表兄杰马尔
<31-5,CASTLE>That's Amir's cousin Jamal.

667
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,320
<31-5,CASTLE>炸弹在他手上
<31-5,CASTLE>And he has the bomb.

668
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,710
<31-5,CASTLE>杰马尔·阿哈比
<31-5,CASTLE>Jamal Alhabi--

669
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,550
<31-5,CASTLE>他找他表兄做了一个核弹
<31-5,CASTLE>He had his cousin Amir fashion a dirty bomb

670
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,490
<31-5,CASTLE>然后杀了他
<31-5,CASTLE>and then he killed him.

671
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,400
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>他应该就是我们要找的恐怖小组头目
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>He's most likely the leader of our terrorist cell.

672
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,230
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>不到12小时前  他带着炸弹消失了
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Now less than 12 hours ago, he disappeared along with the bomb.

673
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,130
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>现在他
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Now at minimum,

674
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,620
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>至少需要辆货车或越野车来转运
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>he'd need a van or an S.U.V. to transport it.

675
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,810
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>杰马尔有家货运公司  检查他的卡车
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Jamal owns a moving company, so check his trucks.

676
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,740
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>把交通录像调出来  查他的财产情况
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Pull traffic video, work his financials.

677
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,080
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>伙计们  我们都住在这儿
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Folks, we live here.

678
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,610
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们的家人  我们的挚爱
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Our families, our loved ones,

679
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,290
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>我们的邻居
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>our neighbors--

680
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,470
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>不必我说  代价有多大
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>I don't have to tell you what's at stake.

681
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,680
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>找到他
<32-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Let's find him.

682
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,970
<32-2,CASTLE>能跟你谈会儿吗
<32-2,CASTLE>Can I talk to you a second?

683
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,040
<32-2,CASTLE>行
<32-2,CASTLE>Yeah.

684
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,440
<33-1,CASTLE>你怎么看法伦
<33-1,CASTLE>What's your take on Fallon?

685
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,670
<33-2,BECKETT>聪明的警察  积极主动  直觉敏锐
<33-2,BECKETT>Smart cop, driven, killer instinct.

686
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,850
<33-2,BECKETT>要说他这个人呢  是个混蛋
<33-2,BECKETT>As a person... kind of a douche.

687
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,460
<33-3,CASTLE>思路开阔的混蛋吗
<33-3,CASTLE>Open-minded douche?

688
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,890
<33-4,BECKETT>不啊  怎么这么问
<33-4,BECKETT>No. Why?

689
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,370
<33-5,CASTLE>好故事最重要的是要真实
<33-5,CASTLE>The key to any good story is authenticity.

690
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,690
<33-5,CASTLE>是为了读者要把故事写得真实
<33-5,CASTLE>It's making it feel real for the reader.

691
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,020
<33-5,CASTLE>这就是为什么作家要下大功夫
<33-5,CASTLE>That's why writers work so hard

692
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,690
<33-5,CASTLE>力求细节完美
<33-5,CASTLE>making the details right.

693
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,790
<33-5,CASTLE>杰马尔和阿米尔是恐怖分子
<33-5,CASTLE>Jamal and Amir as terrorists?

694
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,840
<33-5,CASTLE>细节不对
<33-5,CASTLE>The details are not right.

695
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,090
<33-6,BECKETT>但证据充足
<33-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but the evidence is.

696
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,320
<33-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  监控拍下杰马尔推走核弹
<33-6,BECKETT>Castle, we've got Jamal on video wheeling off a dirty bomb.

697
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,790
<33-7,CASTLE>他为什么不紧张
<33-7,CASTLE>Why wasn't he nervous?

698
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,130
<33-7,CASTLE>为什么每次遇上麻烦他都不慌不忙
<33-7,CASTLE>Why wasn't he sweating bullets every time he hit a bump?

699
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,860
<33-7,CASTLE>杰马尔有家货运公司
<33-7,CASTLE>Jamal owned a moving company.

700
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,420
<33-7,CASTLE>倘若他不知道箱子里是什么呢
<33-7,CASTLE>What if he didn't know what was in the crate?

701
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,690
<33-7,CASTLE>倘若他只不过是被雇来运送的呢
<33-7,CASTLE>What if he was just hired to pick it up?

702
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,320
<33-8,BECKETT>倘若他真是冷血杀手呢
<33-8,BECKETT>What if he's just a cold-blooded killer?

703
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,850
<33-9,CASTLE>就目前所知  对于这两人
<33-9,CASTLE>Well, nothing we've learned points to that

704
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,830
<33-9,CASTLE>-我们均无法断定  -好吧
<33-9,CASTLE>- with either of these men. - Okay,

705
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,400
<33-10,BECKETT>阿米尔收到的那笔钱呢
<33-10,BECKETT>what about that money that Amir received,

706
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,290
<33-10,BECKETT>就是那笔被追踪到阿富汗的钱
<33-10,BECKETT>the money that you traced back to Afghanistan?

707
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,470
<33-11,CASTLE>巴格拉姆空军基地外的一家银行
<33-11,CASTLE>To a bank outside Bagram Air Base,

708
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,960
<33-11,CASTLE>通常都是军事人员才在那儿办业务
<33-11,CASTLE>often used by military personnel.

709
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,940
<33-11,CASTLE>为什么一个恐怖分子会选那所银行来汇款
<33-11,CASTLE>Why would a terrorist pick that bank to wire money?

710
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,540
<33-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们用来打开储存室的钥匙
<33-12,BECKETT>Castle, the keys that we used to open that storage unit

711
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,120
<33-12,BECKETT>是阿米尔钥匙链上的
<33-12,BECKETT>are from Amir's keychain.

712
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,600
<33-13,CASTLE>凶手也可以把钥匙安在上面啊
<33-13,CASTLE>The killer could've put the key there.

713
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,670
<33-13,CASTLE>所有线索都把我们引向阿米尔和杰马尔
<33-13,CASTLE>All these bread crumbs that have led us to Amir and Jamal,

714
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,430
<33-13,CASTLE>-如果是他们留给我的呢  -卡塞尔
<33-13,CASTLE>- what if they were left there for us to find? - Castle--

715
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,360
<33-15,CASTLE>这里面另有隐情
<33-15,CASTLE>Something else is going on here.

716
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,930
<33-16,BECKETT>好吧  你觉得我们应该怎么办
<33-16,BECKETT>Okay, fine. What would you like us to do?

717
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,020
<33-17,CASTLE>跟那个对阿米尔有不同看法的人谈谈
<33-17,CASTLE>Talk to the one person who has a different view of Amir.

718
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,140
<33-17,CASTLE>但是我需要你的帮助
<33-17,CASTLE>But I'm gonna need your help.

719
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,200
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>好了  大家听好了
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>All right. Listen up.

720
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,170
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>杰马尔两个月前买了这些卡车
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Jamal bought these trucks over two months ago.

721
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,180
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>这是运送物品
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's a perfect cover

722
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,630
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>又不被注意的最好伪装
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>for moving material without anyone noticing.

723
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,820
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>员工的名单在哪里
<34-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>Where's the list of his employees?

724
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,990
<34-2,ESPOSITO>刚拿到  九个人  都是中东人
<34-2,ESPOSITO>Just came in. Nine guys, all middle eastern.

725
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,900
<34-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>好的  他们可能都是潜伏小组的成员
<34-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>All right. They're all probably part of the cell.

726
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,590
<34-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>查查他们去过的地方  然后行动
<34-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Let's get their 20s and then move on 'em.

727
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,020
<34-4,RYAN>在杰马尔的信用卡消费记录上
<34-4,RYAN>Got a purchase on Jamal's credit card

728
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,600
<34-4,RYAN>发现他三周前购买了一次性手机
<34-4,RYAN>three weeks ago for a burner phone.

729
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,220
<34-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>查一下  看看能不能调出最近的通话记录
<34-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>Run it down, see if we can pull up any recent activity.

730
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,310
<34-6,BECKETT>杰马尔的搬家卡车都停在皇后区的停车场
<34-6,BECKETT>Jamal's moving trucks are parked in a lot in Queens.

731
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,920
<34-6,BECKETT>除了一辆五吨卡车  其余的都在
<34-6,BECKETT>They're all accounted for except for one 5-ton,

732
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,970
<34-6,BECKETT>记录上显示杰马尔十二小时前把车开走了
<34-6,BECKETT>and the log says Jamal checked it out 12 hours ago,

733
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,410
<34-6,BECKETT>没开回来
<34-6,BECKETT>never brought it back.

734
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,840
<34-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>他肯定是那辆卡车来运送炸弹
<34-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>He must have used it to move the crate.

735
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,940
<34-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>开启预警  我们得找到卡车
<34-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>Call in that alert. Let's find the truck.

736
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,060
<34-8,RYAN>卡塞尔去哪了
<34-8,RYAN>Hey, where's Castle?

737
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,590
<34-9,BECKETT>不知道  出去了吧
<34-9,BECKETT>I don't know. Must have stepped out.

738
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,190
<35-1,FARIQ YUSEF>不管是不是非正式的
<35-1,FARIQ YUSEF>Off the record or not,

739
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,730
<35-1,FARIQ YUSEF>我为什么要跟你谈论阿米尔·阿哈比
<35-1,FARIQ YUSEF>why should I talk to you about Amir Alhabi?

740
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,410
<35-2,CASTLE>因为你最不希望的事就是
<35-2,CASTLE>Because the last thing you want is my country

741
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,070
<35-2,CASTLE>我国认为你们国家在谋划此事
<35-2,CASTLE>thinking your country's behind this activity.

742
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,810
<35-3,FARIQ YUSEF>事实并非如此
<35-3,FARIQ YUSEF>Nothing is further from the truth.

743
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,810
<35-4,CASTLE>那这就可以帮你澄清真相啊
<35-4,CASTLE>Well, then maybe you can help clear this up.

744
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,200
<35-4,CASTLE>阿米尔曾在你的核武器小组  他是人才
<35-4,CASTLE>Amir was in your nuclear program, so he was an asset.

745
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,950
<35-4,CASTLE>你派人监视他了
<35-4,CASTLE>You have him watched?

746
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,150
<35-5,FARIQ YUSEF>保持消息灵通是我的工作
<35-5,FARIQ YUSEF>It's my business to stay informed.

747
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,020
<35-6,CASTLE>你有看到恐怖主义的苗头吗
<35-6,CASTLE>Did you ever see any evidence of terrorism?

748
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,700
<35-6,CASTLE>没有
<35-6,CASTLE>No.

749
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,810
<35-7,FARIQ YUSEF>不过话说回来  我还会有其他的答案吗
<35-7,FARIQ YUSEF>But then, what other answer could I give you?

750
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,640
<35-8,CASTLE>你为什么会去阿米尔家
<35-8,CASTLE>Why were you at Amir's home?

751
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,460
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>和他谈谈
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>To chat with him.

752
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,790
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>我擅长使用暴力  但是那没有必要
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>I am adept at violence, but it wasn't called for.

753
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,030
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>我不时地会与阿米尔见面
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>I met with Amir from time to time

754
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,040
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>提醒他别忘本
<35-9,FARIQ YUSEF>to remind him of his history.

755
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,930
<35-10,CASTLE>劝说他回来...
<35-10,CASTLE>To convince him to come back--

756
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,540
<35-10,CASTLE>回到武器项目小组
<35-10,CASTLE>Back to the weapons program.

757
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,260
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>阿米尔为我们做了重要的研究
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>Amir did vital research for us, but he left

758
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,860
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>但是因为他对他的工作存在道德疑虑  他离开了
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>because he had moral qualms about his work.

759
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,670
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>通常情况  钱可以解决这个问题
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>Normally money can overcome such obstacles.

760
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,490
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>但是在阿米尔这儿行不通
<35-11,FARIQ YUSEF>Not so with Amir.

761
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,710
<35-12,CASTLE>在出租车上发生了什么
<35-12,CASTLE>What happened on that cab ride?

762
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,460
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>阿米尔找到我
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>Amir sought me out.

763
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,500
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>他很生气
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>He was quite angry.

764
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,170
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>他以为我在他的账户里存入一万美金
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>He believed I had placed $10,000 in his account

765
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,760
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>作为给他施压的一种方式
<35-13,FARIQ YUSEF>as a way of pressuring him.

766
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,430
<35-14,CASTLE>-但是他想错了  -等等
<35-14,CASTLE>- But he was mistaken. - Wait a minute.

767
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,920
<35-14,CASTLE>你是说阿米尔不知道钱是从哪来的
<35-14,CASTLE>You're saying Amir didn't know where the money came from?

768
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,800
<35-15,FARIQ YUSEF>跟你谈话很愉快  卡塞尔先生
<35-15,FARIQ YUSEF>It's nice speaking to you, Mr. Castle.

769
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,650
<35-15,FARIQ YUSEF>在事件渐露端倪之时
<35-15,FARIQ YUSEF>As events unfold,

770
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,790
<35-15,FARIQ YUSEF>你可能会发现你们需要有我这种能力的人
<35-15,FARIQ YUSEF>you may find yourself in need of a man with my skills.

771
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,450
<35-16,FARIQ YUSEF>如果真的走到那步的话...
<35-16,FARIQ YUSEF>If such a moment arises...

772
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,650
<36-1,CASTLE>你知道这意味着什么吗
<36-1,CASTLE>Do you realize what this means?

773
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,420
<36-2,BECKETT>如果阿米尔不知道钱的事
<36-2,BECKETT>If Amir didn't know about the money,

774
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,830
<36-2,BECKETT>那就不可能是有人付钱雇他安装炸弹
<36-2,BECKETT>then he couldn't have been paid to build that bomb.

775
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,990
<36-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>我能跟你们两个谈谈吗
<36-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Can I speak with the two of you, please?

776
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,090
<36-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>我喜欢考虑周全  面面俱到
<36-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Now I like to cover my bases.

777
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,890
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>所以你想象的到  当我得知我们的人
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>So you can imagine my surprise when I find out one of our own

778
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,540
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>跑去跟此次调查的
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>is having a nonfat latte

779
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,840
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>嫌疑人喝咖啡我有多惊讶
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>with a suspect in this investigation.

780
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,400
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>我派了探员监视法里克·尤瑟夫
<37-1,AGENT MARK FALLON>I have agents on Fariq Yusef.

781
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,110
<37-2,CASTLE>如果你能让我
<37-2,CASTLE>If you just allow me to

782
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,410
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>-解释...  -我都不知道你在这干什么
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>- explain-- - I don't even know what you're doing here.

783
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,660
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>你竟然去跟外国官员交谈
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>You go and talk to a foreign official?

784
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,000
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>如果叙利亚人是背后主谋怎么办
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>What if the Syrians are behind this?

785
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,100
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>你知道你干了些什么吗
<37-3,AGENT MARK FALLON>Do you have any idea what you've done?

786
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,930
<37-4,CASTLE>杰马尔和阿米尔不是恐怖分子
<37-4,CASTLE>Jamal and Amir are not terrorists.

787
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,000
<37-4,CASTLE>你抓错人了
<37-4,CASTLE>You're chasing the wrong guys--

788
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,030
<37-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>你知道你违犯了多少条法律吗
<37-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>Do you have any idea how many laws you've broken?

789
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,100
<37-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>我应该逮捕你
<37-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>I ought to have you arrested.

790
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,350
<37-6,BECKETT>长官  我认为卡塞尔是想说
<37-6,BECKETT>Sir, I think what Castle is trying to say--

791
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,190
<37-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>-贝克特探长  你知道这事吗  -是的
<37-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>- Detective Beckett, did you know about this? - Yes, I did.

792
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,800
<37-8,BECKETT>太令人失望了
<37-8,BECKETT>Well, that's disappointing.

793
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,720
<37-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>为了国家安全考虑
<37-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>In the interest of national security, I'm gonna

794
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
<37-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>我要把你们两个调离特别行动组
<37-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>have to have the both of you removed from this task force.

795
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,120
<37-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>-你们明白吗  -长官
<37-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>- Do you understand? - Sir.

796
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,750
<37-10,MONTGOMERY>贝克特是我最好的警探
<37-10,MONTGOMERY>Beckett's the best I have.

797
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,090
<37-10,MONTGOMERY>卡塞尔的确总是闯祸
<37-10,MONTGOMERY>Now Castle can be a pain in the ass,

798
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,850
<37-10,MONTGOMERY>但是他有独到的见解
<37-10,MONTGOMERY>but he thinks outside the box.

799
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,780
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>这里不再是你的地盘了  队长
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>It's not your party anymore, captain.

800
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,170
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>我会让探员们送你们出去的
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>I'll have my agents escort you out.

801
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,400
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>对了  卡塞尔
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>Oh, and, Castle?

802
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>州长
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>The governor?

803
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,780
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>他从没听说过你
<37-11,AGENT MARK FALLON>He's never heard of you.

804
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,390
<38-1,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯和玛莎呢
<38-1,BECKETT>Where are Alexis and Martha?

805
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,860
<38-2,CASTLE>我让她们出城了
<38-2,CASTLE>I sent them out of town.

806
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,570
<38-3,BECKETT>他们知道为什么吗
<38-3,BECKETT>Do they know why?

807
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,160
<38-4,CASTLE>不知道  你联系上乔什了吗
<38-4,CASTLE>No. You get ahold of Josh?

808
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,000
<38-5,BECKETT>打不通他的电话
<38-5,BECKETT>Couldn't get through to his cell.

809
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,380
<38-5,BECKETT>他也许已经在飞机上了
<38-5,BECKETT>He's probably already on the plane.

810
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,260
<38-6,CASTLE>纤维密度600的浴帘做成的谋杀线索板
<38-6,CASTLE>A 600-thread-count shower curtain murder board.

811
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,630
<38-6,CASTLE>在我们被赶出去的时候  我拍了一张
<38-6,CASTLE>I snapped a photo of it as we were being thrown out.

812
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,580
<38-6,CASTLE>还有
<38-6,CASTLE>And...

813
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,430
<38-7,CASTLE>这  我有阿米尔的行车数据
<38-7,CASTLE>here... I have Amir's driving data.

814
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,940
<38-7,CASTLE>-这儿就像是我们的迷你分局  -不过味道好很多
<38-7,CASTLE>- It's like our own mini precinct. - Except it smells better.

815
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,840
<38-9,CASTLE>谢谢
<38-9,CASTLE>Thank you.

816
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,710
<38-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  即使阿米尔是无辜的  杰马尔仍是有罪的
<38-10,BECKETT>Castle, even if Amir is innocent, Jamal isn't.

817
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,340
<38-11,CASTLE>他有罪是建立在阿米尔是恐怖分子这个基础上
<38-11,CASTLE>His guilt is predicated on Amir being a terrorist.

818
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,030
<38-11,CASTLE>如这个假设被推翻  杰马尔不过就是搬运工
<38-11,CASTLE>Without that, Jamal's just another guy moving a crate.

819
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,100
<38-11,CASTLE>最终一切都要回到阿米尔
<38-11,CASTLE>No, this all comes back to Amir.

820
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,970
<38-11,CASTLE>我们需要的是解决这起谋杀案
<38-11,CASTLE>What we need to do is solve his murder.

821
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,810
<39-1,ESPOSITO>这是搬家公司网站上的一张图片
<39-1,ESPOSITO>This is a photo off the moving company's web site.

822
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,910
<39-1,ESPOSITO>正是我们要找的那种卡车
<39-1,ESPOSITO>This is the exact truck we're looking for.

823
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,140
<39-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>好的  送到市中心警局
<39-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>All right, send it downtown.

824
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,690
<39-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>-分发给每个当班的警员  -好的
<39-2,AGENT MARK FALLON>- Get it circulated to every officer on duty. - All right.

825
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,150
<39-4,RYAN>-长官  你最好看看这个  -发现了什么
<39-4,RYAN>- Sir, you better have a look at this. - What do you got?

826
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,520
<39-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>技术人员刚刚锁定了杰马尔的一次性手机
<39-5,AGENT MARK FALLON>Tech just got me locked on to Jamal's burner phone.

827
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,230
<39-6,RYAN>看起来他刚刚给另一部一次性手机发了短信
<39-6,RYAN>Looks like he just sent a text to another burner.

829
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,950
<39-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>-你们这儿一共有几架直升飞机  -七架
<39-7,AGENT MARK FALLON>- How many choppers you have in your fleet? - Seven.

830
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,950
<39-8,MONTGOMERY>好的  卡车上装有定时炸弹
<39-8,MONTGOMERY>All right. This truck could be parked

831
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,510
<39-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>停在某个地方  就像俄克拉荷马市那次一样
<39-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>with the bomb set to go off, just like Oklahoma City.

832
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,870
<39-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>组织警员逐街地毯式排查
<39-9,AGENT MARK FALLON>Coordinate a street-by-street grid search.

833
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,150
<40-1,CASTLE>这个理论呢
<40-1,CASTLE>Okay, how about this?

834
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,270
<40-1,CASTLE>阿米尔无意间听到了一次恐怖袭击计划
<40-1,CASTLE>Amir overhears a terrorist plot.

835
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,330
<40-1,CASTLE>他安装了摄像机收集证据
<40-1,CASTLE>He installs cameras to gather evidence,

836
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,970
<40-1,CASTLE>不过他们发现了  并杀害了他
<40-1,CASTLE>only they found out and they killed him.

837
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,690
<40-2,BECKETT>那意味着有位乘客卷入其中
<40-2,BECKETT>That means that a passenger was involved,

838
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,420
<40-2,BECKETT>-一位常客  -是的
<40-2,BECKETT>- a regular passenger. - Right,

839
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,810
<40-3,CASTLE>他们提到了储藏室
<40-3,CASTLE>and they mentioned the storage facility,

840
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,550
<40-3,CASTLE>也正是因此他记下了C4121652
<40-3,CASTLE>which is where he got the C4121652.

841
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,740
<40-4,BECKETT>但是一位乘客为什么会在阿米尔面前
<40-4,BECKETT>But why would a passenger talk about the storage unit

842
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,710
<40-4,BECKETT>谈论储藏室呢  尤其是他们还打算嫁祸于他
<40-4,BECKETT>in front of Amir, especially if they were gonna frame him?

843
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,570
<40-5,CASTLE>也许...我们查错了方向
<40-5,CASTLE>Maybe... we're going about this all wrong.

844
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,720
<40-5,CASTLE>你说得对
<40-5,CASTLE>You are right.

845
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,520
<40-5,CASTLE>乘客是不会公开谈论恐怖袭击计划的
<40-5,CASTLE>A-a passenger wouldn't openly discuss a-a-a terrorist plot,

846
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,130
<40-5,CASTLE>但是司机却会
<40-5,CASTLE>but a driver might--

847
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,130
<40-5,CASTLE>跟同谋者在通电话
<40-5,CASTLE>In the car to a collaborator,

848
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,490
<40-5,CASTLE>一个人在车里
<40-5,CASTLE>alone, on the phone.

849
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,620
<40-5,CASTLE>如果阿米尔怀疑另一位司机呢
<40-5,CASTLE>What if Amir suspected another driver?

850
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,230
<40-5,CASTLE>好了  在这儿
<40-5,CASTLE>Okay, here is...

851
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,460
<40-5,CASTLE>凯文·麦凯恩的上次轮班
<40-5,CASTLE>Kevin Mccann's last shift.

852
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,470
<40-5,CASTLE>这是谋杀案前一天  你看看
<40-5,CASTLE>This is a day before the murder, and look at that.

853
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,870
<40-5,CASTLE>他在储存室公司停过车
<40-5,CASTLE>He stopped near the storage facility

854
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,630
<40-6,BECKETT>-就是放钴60的地方  -他是的士司机  卡塞尔
<40-6,BECKETT>- where they kept the cobalt-60. - He's a cab driver, Castle.

855
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,060
<40-6,BECKETT>他可能就是送乘客
<40-6,BECKETT>He was probably dropping off a fare.

856
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,920
<40-6,BECKETT>再说  他有不在场证明
<40-6,BECKETT>Besides, he alibied out.

857
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,110
<40-7,CASTLE>他也在仓库附近停留过
<40-7,CASTLE>There he is near the warehouse, too.

858
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,620
<40-7,CASTLE>这儿距离我们发现阿米尔尸体的地方只有100码
<40-7,CASTLE>That's 100 yards from where we found Amir's body.

859
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,440
<40-7,CASTLE>阿米尔去的最后两个地方
<40-7,CASTLE>So the last two places Amir was,

860
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,220
<40-7,CASTLE>凯文·麦凯恩都去过
<40-7,CASTLE>and Kevin Mccann has been to both of them?

861
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,000
<40-7,CASTLE>这不可能是巧合
<40-7,CASTLE>There's no way that that's a coincidence.

862
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,900
<40-7,CASTLE>我们至少要去看看为什么这个仓库地区
<40-7,CASTLE>We at least have to go see why this warehouse area

863
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,180
<40-7,CASTLE>这么受欢迎
