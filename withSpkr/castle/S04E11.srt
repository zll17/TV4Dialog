57
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,170
<3-1,BECKETT>蕾妮  是跳楼自杀吗
<3-1,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie. We got a jumper?

58
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,040
<3-2,LANIE>从冲击力来看  他是从七楼以上的
<3-2,LANIE>Judging by the impact, I'd say he came from

59
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,210
<3-2,LANIE>某个房间掉下来的
<3-2,LANIE>one of those windows above the seventh floor.

60
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,970
<3-2,LANIE>莱恩和埃斯波西托同旅馆工作人员
<3-2,LANIE>Ryan and Esposito are already into finding the room

61
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,190
<3-2,LANIE>去找是哪一间了
<3-2,LANIE>with the hotel staff.

62
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,930
<3-3,CASTLE>他全裸唉
<3-3,CASTLE>So... He's naked.

63
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,980
<3-4,LANIE>观察很敏锐嘛
<3-4,LANIE>Perceptive.

64
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,930
<3-5,CASTLE>外面还挺冷的  如果要自杀
<3-5,CASTLE>Well, it is pretty cold out. If this was a suicide,

65
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,540
<3-5,CASTLE>穿得温暖舒适点
<3-5,CASTLE>wouldn't you rather be warm and toasty

66
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,070
<3-5,CASTLE>再赴这必死无疑的水果劫  不好吗
<3-5,CASTLE>on your way down to your certain yet citrusy death?

67
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,760
<3-6,LANIE>如果这是自杀
<3-6,LANIE>If it were a suicide,

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,120
<3-6,LANIE>会留下这几道
<3-6,LANIE>would you really have these...

69
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,950
<3-6,LANIE>一个小时前才抓上去的指甲痕吗
<3-6,LANIE>fingernail marks, only an hour old?

70
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,790
<3-7,BECKETT>看来是他跳楼之前还风流了一把
<3-7,BECKETT>Well, it looks like he did the deed before taking the dive.

71
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,080
<3-8,CASTLE>或许是遗愿清单上的最后一项
<3-8,CASTLE>Last item on your bucket list?

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,190
<3-9,ESPOSITO>两个旅馆员工看到留红色长发的白人女子
<3-9,ESPOSITO>Two hotel clerks saw a white lady with long red hair

73
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,960
<3-9,ESPOSITO>在裸男摔到水果摊上后急冲冲地离开了
<3-9,ESPOSITO>hurrying out shortly after birthday suit hit the fruit.

<3-10,BECKETT>a better description from those clerks,

76
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,250
<3-10,BECKETT>然后去进行排查
<3-10,BECKETT>and let's set up a canvass.

<4-3,CASTLE>死者在触及死亡的霉头之前
<4-3,CASTLE>about our victim getting lucky before he...

93
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,080
<4-3,CASTLE>才交了好运
<4-3,CASTLE>ran out of luck.

94
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,020
<4-4,RYAN>死者名叫麦克·贝利  28岁

96
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,520
<4-4,RYAN>从他的名片来看
<4-4,RYAN>And according to his business card,

97
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,690
<4-4,RYAN>他是市中心环球12联盟的
<4-4,RYAN>he's a junior analyst at Global 12 Consolidated

98
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,640
<4-4,RYAN>初级分析师
<4-4,RYAN>in midtown.

99
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,590
<4-5,BECKETT>是谁订的房间
<4-5,BECKETT>Who booked the room?

100
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,880
<4-6,RYAN>用简·爱的名字订的
<4-6,RYAN>Booked under Jane Eyre.

<4-6,RYAN>用现金结账  没有留下信用卡号
<4-6,RYAN>Paid with cash. No credit card on file.

102
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,870
<4-7,CASTLE>意味着这是计划好的

103
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,240
<4-7,CASTLE>她知道自己要杀掉他
<4-7,CASTLE>She knew she was gonna kill him,

104
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,050
<4-7,CASTLE>所以她用化名订了房间
<4-7,CASTLE>so she booked the room anonymously.

105
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,230
<4-8,BECKETT>可为什么要和他发生关系
<4-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but then why sleep with him?

106
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,660
<4-8,BECKETT>为什么不直接把他推出窗外就好
<4-8,BECKETT>Why not just push him out the window?

108
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,150
<4-9,CASTLE>因为她是个黑寡妇
<4-9,CASTLE>Because she's a black widow...

109
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,050
<4-10,CASTLE>世界上最冷血无情的生物
<4-10,CASTLE>the coldest-hearted creature on earth.

110
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,150
<4-10,CASTLE>她诱惑一个毫无防范的男人
<4-10,CASTLE>She lures an unsuspecting male,

111
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,980
<4-10,CASTLE>将他引到自己网中
<4-10,CASTLE>takes him into her web,

112
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,730
<4-10,CASTLE>然后在他们达到高潮的那一刻
<4-10,CASTLE>and then the moment they culminate,

113
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,300
<4-10,CASTLE>正当他感受到
<4-10,CASTLE>as soon as he feels the ecstasy

114
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,410
<4-10,CASTLE>完成本能使命时的销魂
<4-10,CASTLE>of achieving his biological destiny,

115
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,630
<4-10,CASTLE>她就张开血口将他生吞活剥
<4-10,CASTLE>she opens up her jaws and eats him alive.

116
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,610
<4-11,RYAN>我真庆幸我的爱情很健康
<4-11,RYAN>I'm glad I'm in a healthy relationship.

<4-13,CASTLE>也以为他们的爱情很健康
<4-13,CASTLE>think they're in healthy relationships, too.

120
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,480
<4-14,BECKETT>不管是不是黑寡妇
<4-14,BECKETT>Well, black widow or not,

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,790
<4-14,BECKETT>我想
<4-14,BECKETT>I think...

122
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,050
<4-14,BECKETT>我知道该如何找到她了
<4-14,BECKETT>I figured out how we can find her.

<5-2,BECKETT>Okay. Well, I don't care about your law firm.

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,270
<5-2,BECKETT>有个男人今晚摔死了
<5-2,BECKETT>A man fell to his death tonight,

129
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,120
<5-2,BECKETT>指纹证明你曾出现在犯罪现场
<5-2,BECKETT>and fingerprints confirm that you were at the crime scene.

130
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,270
<5-3,HOLLY>不  这不关我的事
<5-3,HOLLY>No, I had nothing to do with it.

131
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,830
<5-4,BECKETT>也许你能告诉我为什么有人看到
<5-4,BECKETT>Okay, maybe you can tell me why people saw you

132
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,520
<5-4,BECKETT>你从犯罪现场逃走
<5-4,BECKETT>fleeing the crime scene.

133
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,350
<5-5,BECKETT>富兰克林小姐
<5-5,BECKETT>Ms. Franklin,

134
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,210
<5-5,BECKETT>证据显示你和麦克
<5-5,BECKETT>Evidence suggests that you and Michael...

135
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,260
<5-7,BECKETT>-麦克  -贝利有肉体关系
<5-7,BECKETT>- Michael?  - Bailey were romantically involved.

136
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,670
<5-8,HOLLY>哪个麦克
<5-8,HOLLY>Michael who?

137
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,370
<5-9,BECKETT>这个人
<5-9,BECKETT>This man.

138
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,270
<5-10,HOLLY>不  他不叫麦克
<5-10,HOLLY>No, that's not Michael.

139
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,250
<5-10,HOLLY>他叫杰克  杰克·亨德里克斯
<5-10,HOLLY>That's Jake. That's Jake Hendricks.

140
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,490
<5-11,BECKETT>不  他叫麦克·贝利
<5-11,BECKETT>No, that's Michael Bailey.

141
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,760
<5-12,HOLLY>我想我知道自己和谁睡了
<5-12,HOLLY>I think I would know who I was sleeping with.

142
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,540
<5-13,BECKETT>看起来你并不知道啊
<5-13,BECKETT>Well, apparently, you don't.

143
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,700
<6-1,ESPOSITO>你觉得我该去查她的电话记录吗
<6-1,ESPOSITO>You think I should pull her phone records?

144
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,670
<6-2,RYAN>何必去查呢
<6-2,RYAN>Nah, what's the point?

145
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,490
<6-2,RYAN>我们已经掌握她和死者同在旅馆的证据了
<6-2,RYAN>We already have her at the hotel with our victim.

146
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,530
<6-3,ESPOSITO>不是查她
<6-3,ESPOSITO>Not her.

147
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,280
<6-4,RYAN>是查蕾妮
<6-4,RYAN>Lanie.

148
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,730
<6-4,RYAN>什么
<6-4,RYAN>What?

149
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,080
<6-5,ESPOSITO>不查出那个男人是谁
<6-5,ESPOSITO>I'm not gonna go to your wedding

150
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,860
<6-5,ESPOSITO>我是不会参加你婚礼的
<6-5,ESPOSITO>without knowing who this guy is.

151
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,610
<6-6,RYAN>珍妮要写座位卡就必须知道他的名字
<6-6,RYAN>Jenny has to find out for the place cards.

152
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,350
<6-6,RYAN>我会告诉你的
<6-6,RYAN>I'll get you his name.

153
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,110
<6-6,RYAN>好
<6-6,RYAN>Okay.

154
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,240
<7-1,HOLLY>他告诉我  他名叫杰克
<7-1,HOLLY>He told me his name was Jake.

155
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,720
<7-1,HOLLY>他说他是从芝加哥飞来
<7-1,HOLLY>Um, he said that he flies in from Chicago

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,350
<7-1,HOLLY>为家族事业谈生意的
<7-1,HOLLY>to make sales calls for his family business?

157
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,580
<7-1,HOLLY>他非常贴心
<7-1,HOLLY>He was really sweet.

158
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,560
<7-3,HOLLY>我没有杀他
<7-3,HOLLY>I didn't kill him.

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
<7-4,BECKETT>我跟他坠入爱河
<7-4,BECKETT>I was falling in love with him.

160
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,470
<7-2,BECKETT>他也"坠"得挺狠的
<7-2,BECKETT>Well, he fell pretty hard, too.

161
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,580
<7-2,BECKETT>你们开始约会多久了
<7-2,BECKETT>So how long were the two of you dating?

162
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,400
<7-3,HOLLY>其实我们今晚才认识
<7-3,HOLLY>Uh, well, we, uh, we actually just met tonight.

163
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,600
<7-3,HOLLY>7点左右  在威尔莫酒吧
<7-3,HOLLY>Um, at Wilmer's Bar at around 7:00.

164
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,310
<7-4,BECKETT>今晚
<7-4,BECKETT>Tonight?

165
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,290
<7-4,BECKETT>那你就已经和他坠入爱河了
<7-4,BECKETT>And you were already falling in love with him?

166
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,370
<7-4,BECKETT>我知道听起来很不靠谱
<7-4,BECKETT>Look, I-I know-- I know it sounds crazy,

167
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,250
<7-5,HOLLY>可这就像是传说中的
<7-5,HOLLY>but it felt like one of those magical connections

168
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,170
<7-5,HOLLY>心有灵犀  你懂吗
<7-5,HOLLY>that you read about, you know?

169
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,760
<7-5,HOLLY>在我们
<7-5,HOLLY>After we...

170
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,960
<7-5,HOLLY>那个之后
<7-5,HOLLY>you know, um,

171
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,390
<7-5,HOLLY>他开始头晕
<7-5,HOLLY>he started to get dizzy

172
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,650
<7-5,HOLLY>汗流不止
<7-5,HOLLY>and... sweaty.

173
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,370
<7-5,HOLLY>于是他开窗想呼吸点新鲜空气
<7-5,HOLLY>So he opened up a window to get some fresh air,

174
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,000
<7-5,HOLLY>然后他斜靠在窗台边上
<7-5,HOLLY>and he was leaning against the windowsill

175
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,630
<7-5,HOLLY>突然间...
<7-5,HOLLY>when suddenly...

176
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,300
<7-5,HOLLY>他就...
<7-5,HOLLY>he just...

177
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,850
<7-6,BECKETT>那么你是说...
<7-6,BECKETT>Okay. So you're saying that...

178
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,950
<7-6,BECKETT>他从窗户上摔下去
<7-6,BECKETT>He fell out the window

179
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,030
<7-6,BECKETT>而你的第一反应不是叫救护车
<7-6,BECKETT>and your first instinct wasn't to call 9-1-1,

180
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,440
<7-6,BECKETT>而是自己逃跑
<7-6,BECKETT>but to run away?

181
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,430
<7-7,HOLLY>我知道你们会怎么想  可是我吓坏了
<7-7,HOLLY>I knew how it would look, but I panicked

182
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,440
<7-7,HOLLY>然后做了一个非常糟糕的决定
<7-7,HOLLY>and I made a really bad decision.

183
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,190
<7-7,HOLLY>但是我发誓  这绝对只是一起意外
<7-7,HOLLY>But I swear, it was an accident.

184
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,600
<8-1,LANIE>这不是一起意外
<8-1,LANIE>It was not an accident.

185
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,680
<8-2,CASTLE>你能鉴定出他是被推下去的
<8-2,CASTLE>You can tell he was pushed?

186
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,860
<8-3,LANIE>我不是说他是被人推下去的
<8-3,LANIE>I didn't say he was pushed.

187
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,190
<8-3,LANIE>麦克·贝利被人下毒
<8-3,LANIE>Michael Bailey was poisoned

188
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,180
<8-3,LANIE>服下了致命剂量的秋水仙素
<8-3,LANIE>with a lethal dose of colchicine.

189
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,840
<8-3,LANIE>在他摔到水果车上之前就已经死了
<8-3,LANIE>He was dead before he hit the fruit.

190
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,510
<8-4,CASTLE>秋水仙素
<8-4,CASTLE>Colchicine?

191
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,000
<8-4,CASTLE>不是一种用来治疗风湿的药吗
<8-4,CASTLE>Isn't that a drug for rheumatism?

192
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,270
<8-5,LANIE>没错  但是贝利没有风湿病
<8-5,LANIE>Yes, which Bailey does not have,

193
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,990
<8-5,LANIE>而且他体内含有正常值五十倍的药量
<8-5,LANIE>but he had 50 times the normal dosage in his system.

194
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,550
<8-5,LANIE>我推测他服入药物的时间
<8-5,LANIE>I'm putting the time of ingestion

195
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,230
<8-5,LANIE>应该在当天下午四点到六点之间
<8-5,LANIE>between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.

196
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,520
<8-6,CASTLE>那就是霍莉说她们在威尔莫酒吧
<8-6,CASTLE>Which is 45 minutes before

197
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,270
<8-6,CASTLE>相遇前的45分钟左右
<8-6,CASTLE>Holly said she met him at Wilmer's bar.

198
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,010
<8-7,BECKETT>知道他是怎么服入药物的吗
<8-7,BECKETT>Any idea how that drug was delivered?

199
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,590
<8-8,LANIE>混在他喝的饮料里
<8-8,LANIE>It was in something he drank.

200
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,360
<8-8,LANIE>我在他的胃里找到很多乳清分离蛋白
<8-8,LANIE>I found lots of whey-protein isolate in his stomach,

201
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
<8-8,LANIE>以及一些巧克力
<8-8,LANIE>along with chocolate.

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,960
<8-9,CASTLE>那就是巧克力蛋白奶昔
<8-9,CASTLE>So a chocolate protein shake.

203
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,340
<8-10,LANIE>那种饮料的甜味足以掩盖药物的味道
<8-10,LANIE>It'd be sweet enough to mask the taste of the drug.

204
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,010
<8-11,CASTLE>说到甜  莱恩的婚礼你要带谁作男伴
<8-11,CASTLE>Speaking of sweet, who's your date for Ryan's wedding?

205
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,780
<8-12,CASTLE>碰碰运气嘛
<8-12,CASTLE>Took a shot.

206
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,590
<8-13,BECKETT>就这样吧  多谢  蕾妮
<8-13,BECKETT>All right. Thanks, Lanie.

207
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,430
<8-14,LANIE>还有一件事
<8-14,LANIE>One more thing.

208
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,400
<8-14,LANIE>我做了一个DNA测试想证实
<8-14,LANIE>I ran a D.N.A. test just to confirm

209
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,570
<8-14,LANIE>这位超人先生死前是否与人上床
<8-14,LANIE>that superman here had sex before dying--

210
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,570
<8-15,BECKETT>-不用了  嫌疑人已经...  -让我说完
<8-15,BECKETT>- No, it's okay. Our suspect... - Let me finish.

211
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,910
<8-16,LANIE>测试结果显示他确实与人上床了
<8-16,LANIE>The test shows he had sex all right,

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,130
<8-16,LANIE>而且是跟两个不同的女人
<8-16,LANIE>with two different women

213
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,000
<8-16,LANIE>都在他死前的几个小时内
<8-16,LANIE>within hours of his death.

214
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,430
<8-17,CASTLE>你这个坏小子
<8-17,CASTLE>You dog.

215
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,050
<8-17,CASTLE>富兰克林小姐  看来...
<8-17,CASTLE>Ms. Franklin, I-it--

216
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,230
<9-1,RYAN>看来贝利先生去世之前的几个小时内
<9-1,RYAN>It seems that you weren't the only woman that--

217
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,220
<9-1,RYAN>你不是唯一一个
<9-1,RYAN>that Mr. Bailey was, uh...

218
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,660
<9-1,RYAN>跟他在一起的女性
<9-1,RYAN>with in the hours prior to his death.

219
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,900
<9-2,HOLLY>你说的在一起  是什么意思
<9-2,HOLLY>Um, what do you mean, with?

220
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,260
<9-3,RYAN>在酒店里是不是还有一名女性跟你们一起
<9-3,RYAN>Was there another woman in the hotel room with you?

221
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,070
<9-4,HOLLY>我还以为我不可能更丢人了
<9-4,HOLLY>I didn't think this could get any more humiliating.

222
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,260
<9-5,RYAN>-那你是承认了  -当然没有  警探先生
<9-5,RYAN>－ Was that a yes? － No, detective.

223
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,440
<9-6,HOLLY>多谢告知
<9-6,HOLLY>Thank you.

224
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,490
<9-7,RYAN>我应该告诉你我们的法医
<9-7,RYAN>Oh, and you should know that our M.E.

225
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,210
<9-7,RYAN>鉴定认为贝利先生
<9-7,RYAN>has been able to determine that Mr. Bailey

226
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,890
<9-7,RYAN>在两次做爱时
<9-7,RYAN>was, uh... wearing a condom

227
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,750
<9-7,RYAN>都带了安全套  所以...
<9-7,RYAN>both times so that's...

228
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,790
<9-8,HOLLY>真是让我感觉好多了啊
<9-8,HOLLY>That makes it all better.

229
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,240
<9-9,HOLLY>现在我倒希望是我亲手推他下去的
<9-9,HOLLY>Now I wish I pushed him!

231
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,350
<10-1,RYAN>女人的怒火真可怕
<10-1,RYAN>Hell hath no fury, all right.

232
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,710
<10-1,RYAN>但是我十分肯定她没有说谎
<10-1,RYAN>But I'm pretty sure she's telling the truth.

233
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,030
<10-2,BECKETT>可能吧  但是放人之前
<10-2,BECKETT>Yeah, maybe, but let's just confirm her alibi

234
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,030
<10-2,BECKETT>再确认一下她的不在场证明
<10-2,BECKETT>before releasing her.

235
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,200
<10-3,CASTLE>同时  我们得查明
<10-3,CASTLE>In the meantime, we need to figure out

236
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,160
<10-3,CASTLE>下午四点到六点之间
<10-3,CASTLE>where Bailey was and who he was with

237
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,970
<10-3,CASTLE>贝利去过哪里  跟谁在一起
<10-3,CASTLE>between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. when he was poisoned.

238
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,590
<10-3,CASTLE>没错
<10-3,CASTLE>Exactly.

239
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,710
<10-4,BECKETT>这是凶手的行凶的时间
<10-4,BECKETT>That is our kill zone.

240
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,280
<10-5,ESPOSITO>我找不到他有任何近亲属
<10-5,ESPOSITO>So I can't find any next of kin on the guy.

241
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,410
<10-5,ESPOSITO>父母在几年前都已过世
<10-5,ESPOSITO>Parents died years ago.

242
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,760
<10-5,ESPOSITO>没有兄弟姐妹  什么亲人都没有
<10-5,ESPOSITO>There's no siblings, no nothing.

243
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,600
<10-6,ESPOSITO>你还好吧
<10-6,ESPOSITO>You okay?

244
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,640
<10-7,RYAN>我很好
<10-7,RYAN>Fine.

245
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,990
<10-8,BECKETT>那贝利告诉霍莉的所有
<10-8,BECKETT>So then everything Bailey

246
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,490
<10-8,BECKETT>关于自己的事都是谎言
<10-8,BECKETT>told Holly about himself was a lie.

247
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,020
<10-9,CASTLE>可能这就是他的把戏
<10-9,CASTLE>Mm. Maybe that was his trick.

248
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,990
<10-9,CASTLE>来自外地  顾家  有事业
<10-9,CASTLE>In from out of town, family guy, own business--

249
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,420
<10-9,CASTLE>这样才能骗女人跟他上床
<10-9,CASTLE>That's how he got women in bed.

250
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,180
<10-10,RYAN>不管他为什么要骗霍莉
<10-10,RYAN>Whatever his reason for lying to Holly,

251
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,660
<10-10,RYAN>我打赌凶手就是贝利之前
<10-10,RYAN>I'm betting that our killer is whoever Bailey slept with

252
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,530
<10-10,RYAN>睡过的那个女人
<10-10,RYAN>earlier in the day.

253
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,530
<10-10,RYAN>她发现他玩弄人感情  于是实施报复
<10-10,RYAN>She got on to his philandering and got even.

254
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,510
<10-11,BECKETT>好的  查他的通话记录
<10-11,BECKETT>All right. Go through his phone records.

255
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,130
<10-11,BECKETT>我们得找到另外那个女人
<10-11,BECKETT>We gotta find that other woman.

256
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,860
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>早上好  爸爸
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Good morning, dad.

257
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,020
<11-2,CASTLE>早上好
<11-2,CASTLE>Good morning.

258
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,650
<11-3,MARTHA RODGERS>亲爱的  你的信用卡放在哪儿
<11-3,MARTHA RODGERS>Darling, where's your credit card?

259
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,840
<11-4,CASTLE>还是"早上好"更顺耳
<11-4,CASTLE>Mm. Liked "Good morning" better.

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,160
<11-5,CASTLE>问你们俩一个问题
<11-5,CASTLE>Let me ask you two something. Mm.

261
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,480
<11-5,CASTLE>如果你们发现自己的男人背叛了你
<11-5,CASTLE>If you found out a man was cheating on you,

262
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,210
<11-5,CASTLE>你们会选择怎么杀死他
<11-5,CASTLE>how would you kill him?

263
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,310
<11-6,MARTHA>用刀  直插心脏
<11-6,MARTHA>Knife... to the heart.

264
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,120
<11-7,CASTLE>好吧  那如果你没有勇气这么做呢
<11-7,CASTLE>All right. What if you don't have the stomach for that?

265
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,100
<11-9,CASTLE>-一枪毙命  -你也没有勇气这么做
<11-9,CASTLE>- Shoot him. But you don't have the stomach for that either.

266
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,200
<11-10,MARTHA>-我们的勇气到哪儿去了  -总是还能下毒
<11-10,MARTHA>- What's wrong with our stomachs? - There's always poison.

267
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,280
<11-12,MARTHA>没错  看着他被痛苦折磨
<11-12,MARTHA>True. Watch him writhe and suffer.

268
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,120
<11-13,ALEXIS>就像一只牲畜一样死掉
<11-13,ALEXIS>Die like the rodent he is.

269
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,140
<11-14,CASTLE>这么多年来总是在写凶手的故事
<11-14,CASTLE>All these years writing about murderers,

270
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,570
<11-14,CASTLE>竟不知我与她们同住一个屋檐下
<11-14,CASTLE>I had no idea I was living among them. Well...

271
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,550
<11-15,CASTLE>说到谋杀  你要我的信用卡做什么
<11-15,CASTLE>Speaking of murder, what's the credit card for?

272
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,590
<11-16,ALEXIS>我们要去逛街给我买件礼服
<11-16,ALEXIS>Oh, we're going shopping to pick out my dress

273
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,090
<11-16,ALEXIS>好陪你去参加莱恩的婚礼
<11-16,ALEXIS>to be your date at ryan's wedding.

274
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,710
<11-17,CASTLE>你之前的那些礼服不都很好吗
<11-17,CASTLE>What's wrong with the ones you have?

275
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,630
<11-17,CASTLE>亲爱的
<11-17,CASTLE>Darling,

276
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,140
<11-18,MARTHA>美丽不是无心插柳得来的
<11-18,MARTHA>Beauty does not happen by accident.

277
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,280
<11-19,ALEXIS>所以一旦不知好歹的臭男人辜负了我们
<11-19,ALEXIS>And that's why, when it goes unappreciated by cheating scum,

278
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,090
<11-19,ALEXIS>我们定会复仇
<11-19,ALEXIS>we want revenge.

279
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,310
<12-1,CASTLE>即使是她们虚构的怨气都让人毛骨悚然
<12-1,CASTLE>Even their hypothetical fury is unnerving.

280
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,420
<12-1,CASTLE>威廉·康格里夫关于受了侮辱的女人
<12-1,CASTLE>William Congreve had it right

281
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,840
<12-1,CASTLE>的言论真是没有说错
<12-1,CASTLE>when he talked about scorned women.

282
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
<12-2,BECKETT>是吗  你都还没听到过我会怎么做
<12-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you haven't heard what I would do.

283
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,060
<12-3,CASTLE>我想我还是不知道的好
<12-3,CASTLE>Yeah, I don't think I ever want to know.

284
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,780
<12-4,BECKETT>嗨  伙计们
<12-4,BECKETT>Hey, guys.

285
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,130
<12-4,BECKETT>关于贝利之前的那个女人找得怎么样了
<12-4,BECKETT>Hmm? Any luck tracking down Bailey's other woman?

286
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,950
<12-6,ESPOSITO>找到不少
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Uh... A lot of luck.

287
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,580
<12-7,CASTLE>有点像《单身汉》[真人秀]的开头
<12-7,CASTLE>It's like the beginning of "The Bachelor",

288
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,240
<12-7,CASTLE>只是缺了苹果马丁尼
<12-7,CASTLE>but without the appletinis.

289
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,470
<12-8,BECKETT>贝利跟这么多女性都发生过关系
<12-8,BECKETT>Bailey was involved with all of them?

290
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,120
<12-9,RYAN>是啊
<12-9,RYAN>Uh, yeah.

291
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,030
<12-9,RYAN>而且每个人都觉得自己是他的爱和唯一
<12-9,RYAN>And each of them thought that they were his one and only.

292
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,400
<12-10,CASTLE>这可是不少受到了侮辱的女人啊
<12-10,CASTLE>That's a lot of scorned women...

293
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,810
<12-10,CASTLE>而且都有不小的怒火
<12-10,CASTLE>and a lot of fury.

303
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,220
<13-1,CASTLE>可是我就是想不明白
<13-1,CASTLE>Yeah. Yeah, I don't get it.

304
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,380
<13-1,CASTLE>为什么这样一个长相平凡的男人
<13-1,CASTLE>H-how does an average looking guy

305
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,060
<13-1,CASTLE>做着一份普普通通的分析师工作
<13-1,CASTLE>with a dime-a-dozen analyst job

306
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,010
<13-1,CASTLE>竟然可以泡到这么多美丽的女人
<13-1,CASTLE>end up dating all of these gorgeous women?

307
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,360
<13-2,BECKETT>对她们说谎呗
<13-2,BECKETT>By lying to them.

308
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,640
<13-3,ESPOSITO>实际上  他并没对她们撒谎
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Actually, he wasn't lying to these women.

309
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,990
<13-3,ESPOSITO>至少关于他的身份他没有说谎
<13-3,ESPOSITO>At least not about who he was anyway.

310
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,340
<13-3,ESPOSITO>她们都知道他的真名
<13-3,ESPOSITO>They all knew him by his real name.

311
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,750
<13-4,CASTLE>那为什么告诉霍莉他是来自芝加哥的杰克
<13-4,CASTLE>Then why would he tell Holly that he's Jake from Chicago?

312
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,090
<13-5,BECKETT>那昨天下午四点到六点之间
<13-5,BECKETT>Was Bailey with any of those women

313
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,870
<13-5,BECKETT>贝利有跟她们其中的某位在一起吗
<13-5,BECKETT>between 4:00 and 6:00 yesterday?

314
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,710
<13-6,ESPOSITO>照目前看来  都没有
<13-6,ESPOSITO>So far, no.

315
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,130
<13-6,ESPOSITO>而且她们都说不知道他居然还在市里
<13-6,ESPOSITO>But they all deny knowing that he was even in the city.

316
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,950
<13-6,ESPOSITO>一个月前  他告诉她们每个人
<13-6,ESPOSITO>A month ago, he told every one of 'em

317
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,250
<13-6,ESPOSITO>他要去欧洲呆六个礼拜
<13-6,ESPOSITO>he was going to Europe for six weeks.

318
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,430
<13-7,CASTLE>一个月前
<13-7,CASTLE>A month ago?

319
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,840
<13-7,CASTLE>那他为什么提前回来了
<13-7,CASTLE>So why'd he come back early?

320
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,810
<13-8,ESPOSITO>他根本没有去
<13-8,ESPOSITO>He never went.

321
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,690
<13-8,ESPOSITO>而且从他的信用卡记录来看
<13-8,ESPOSITO>And as far as I can tell from his credit card use,

322
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,010
<13-8,ESPOSITO>他根本没离开过纽约
<13-8,ESPOSITO>he never even left New York.

323
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,130
<13-9,BECKETT>那为什么要告诉她们自己要离开
<13-9,BECKETT>So why tell them that he was leaving?

324
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,670
<13-9,BECKETT>莫非想用一种懦弱的方式跟她们分手
<13-9,BECKETT>I mean, was that just a cowardly way of breaking up with them?

325
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,190
<13-10,ESPOSITO>我觉得另有其他原因
<13-10,ESPOSITO>I think there's something else going on.

326
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,810
<13-10,ESPOSITO>我打电话到环球12联盟的人事部
<13-10,ESPOSITO>I called the personnel department at global 12 consolidated.

327
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,520
<13-10,ESPOSITO>他们说他之前一个月
<13-10,ESPOSITO>And they said that he's been on a leave of absence

328
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
<13-10,ESPOSITO>都请了假
<13-10,ESPOSITO>for the last month.

329
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,010
<13-11,CASTLE>这个月有大事啊
<13-11,CASTLE>That's a big month--

330
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,370
<13-11,CASTLE>跟单位和女朋友们那儿都请了假
<13-11,CASTLE>taking a leave from work and your girlfriends.

331
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,110
<13-12,RYAN>公寓也没回
<13-12,RYAN>And his apartment.

332
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,460
<13-13,RYAN>贝利公寓楼的门卫说过去一个月来
<13-13,RYAN>The doorman at Bailey's building said that for the past month,

333
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,660
<13-13,RYAN>他经常不在家里住
<13-13,RYAN>he's only spent a couple nights a week there.

334
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,320
<13-14,ESPOSITO>过去的一个月
<13-14,ESPOSITO>Past month. Hmm.

335
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
<13-15,RYAN>是的  他昨天一整天都没回去过
<13-15,RYAN>Yeah. He wasn't there at all yesterday,

336
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,000
<13-15,RYAN>所以他不是在家里被下毒的
<13-15,RYAN>so that's not where he was poisoned.

337
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,880
<13-15,RYAN>我翻查了他的镜台
<13-15,RYAN>And I looked in his dresser

338
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,090
<13-15,RYAN>找到了这个
<13-15,RYAN>and I found this.

339
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,550
<13-15,RYAN>伊利诺伊州的驾照
<13-15,RYAN>Illinois driver's license.

340
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,210
<13-16,BECKETT>杰克·亨德里克斯  芝加哥市
<13-16,BECKETT>Jake Hendricks, Chicago.

341
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,160
<13-16,BECKETT>这就是他告诉霍莉的名字
<13-16,BECKETT>That's the name that he gave Holly.

342
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,010
<13-17,CASTLE>那他真的是杰克·亨德里克斯
<13-17,CASTLE>So he is Jake Hendricks?

343
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,010
<13-18,RYAN>不是  他是麦克·贝利  这张是假的
<13-18,RYAN>No, he's Mike Bailey. That's a fake.

344
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,010
<13-19,CASTLE>这肯定不是他在街头随随便便买来的
<13-19,CASTLE>He did not buy this on some street corner.

345
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,190
<13-19,CASTLE>这是高仿啊
<13-19,CASTLE>This is government grade.

346
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,810
<13-20,RYAN>连安全全息图都有
<13-20,RYAN>Yeah, right down to the security hologram.

347
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,910
<13-20,RYAN>他就像是在做卧底
<13-20,RYAN>It's like he was living undercover.

348
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,440
<13-20,RYAN>我还找到了这个
<13-20,RYAN>And I found this.

349
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,460
<13-21,ESPOSITO>真是一块不小的蛋糕
<13-21,ESPOSITO>That's a lot of cake.

350
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,470
<13-22,RYAN>你为什么非得叫它蛋糕  这些就是钱
<13-22,RYAN>Why do you have to call it cake? It's money.

351
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,130
<13-22,RYAN>很大一笔钱  大约六万美金
<13-22,RYAN>It's a lot of money. It's about 60 grand.

352
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,980
<13-23,BECKETT>现金  假身份
<13-23,BECKETT>Cash, fake ID.

353
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,850
<13-23,BECKETT>贝利到底在搞什么
<13-23,BECKETT>What the hell was Bailey into?

354
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,410
<13-24,CASTLE>比为了勾搭女人而捏造身份要大的事
<13-24,CASTLE>Something bigger than lying about who he was just to get laid.

355
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,950
<13-24,CASTLE>杰克·亨德里克斯有一个假网站
<13-24,CASTLE>Jake Hendricks has fake web search hits.

356
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,670
<13-24,CASTLE>住在芝加哥  在家族企业工作
<13-24,CASTLE>Lives in Chicago, works for the family business.

357
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,010
<13-25,ESPOSITO>就像他告诉霍莉·富兰克林的
<13-25,ESPOSITO>Just like he told Holly Franklin.

358
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,700
<13-26,CASTLE>家族企业也有一个假网站
<13-26,CASTLE>Family business has a fake web site.

359
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,320
<13-27,BECKETT>这谎编的还挺到位
<13-27,BECKETT>That's a pretty deep cover.

361
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,310
<13-28,CASTLE>是的  这位情圣看上去越来越像杰森·伯恩了
<13-28,CASTLE>Yeah. Our Don Juan's starting to look more like Jason Bourne.

362
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,540
<13-29,BECKETT>你们去联系联调局和中情局
<13-29,BECKETT>All right, you guys get ahold of FBI and CIA

363
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,910

364
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,030
<13-29,BECKETT>看看他是不是他们的人

<14-3,AMY KEMP>It's not like these negotiations are going anywhere.

<14-5,BECKETT>I understand that he took a leave of absence a month ago.

380
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,530
<14-5,BECKETT>他有说是什么原因吗
<14-5,BECKETT>Did he give you a reason why?

381
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,070
<14-6,HARRIS>私人事务
<14-6,HARRIS>Personal issues.

382

<14-6,HARRIS>他没说为什么  但我能听出来挺严重的
<14-6,HARRIS>He didn't say why, but I could tell it was serious.

<14-7,CASTLE>这么说你不知道他为什么会有

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,570
<14-8,HARRIS>闯入他办公室的女人有关系
<14-8,HARRIS>that tried to break in his office yesterday.

<14-10,HARRIS>她在警卫到达之前逃走了
<14-10,HARRIS>She was gone before security got there.

390
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,680
<14-11,BECKETT>是谁上报的
<14-11,BECKETT>And who reported it?

391
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,910
<15-1,AMY>我在谈判中途出来上厕所
<15-1,AMY>I had stepped out of negotiations to go to the restroom.

392
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,250
<15-1,AMY>我注意到走廊里有一个女人
<15-1,AMY>And in the hallway, I noticed a woman was trying

393
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,660
<15-1,AMY>在用扳手和别针
<15-1,AMY>to pick an office door lock

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,330
<15-1,AMY>撬一间办公室的门
<15-1,AMY>using a wrench and an opened-up paper clip.

395
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,570
<15-1,AMY>我想她大概是被锁在自己办公室外面了
<15-1,AMY>I assumed she had just locked herself out of her office

396
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,590
<15-1,AMY>就开玩笑说钥匙会比较管用
<15-1,AMY>and joked that a key would work better.

397
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,880
<15-1,AMY>但她被吓了一跳
<15-1,AMY>Well, she was startled

398
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,620
<15-1,AMY>然后推开我冲下楼梯了
<15-1,AMY>and shoved me over and made a dash for the stairwell.

399
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,880
<15-2,BECKETT>你看到她长什么样子了吗

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,010
<17-5,COLETTE>我在他家外面等他
<17-5,COLETTE>I was outside his apartment waiting for him.

450
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,210
<17-5,COLETTE>但他没回来
<17-5,COLETTE>But he never came.

451
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,600
<17-6,BECKETT>你昨天一天都没闲着
<17-6,BECKETT>You had a very busy day yesterday.

452
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,330
<17-6,BECKETT>在那之前几小时  有人看见你
<17-6,BECKETT>You were seen trying to break in to his office

453
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,400
<17-6,BECKETT>试图闯入他的办公室
<17-6,BECKETT>just hours before that.

454
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,700
<17-7,COLETTE>我是在试图寻找线索
<17-7,COLETTE>I was hoping to find some kind of clue,

455
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,300
<17-7,COLETTE>好让我顺藤摸瓜找到他的仇家
<17-7,COLETTE>something that might lead me to his enemies.

456
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,260
<17-8,CASTLE>他的仇家
<17-8,CASTLE>His enemies?

457
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,360
<17-9,COLETTE>麦克被人追杀
<17-9,COLETTE>Michael was a hunted man.

458
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,150
<17-10,BECKETT>被谁追杀
<17-10,BECKETT>Hunted, by who?

459
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,360
<17-10,BECKETT>我不知道
<17-10,BECKETT>I don't know.

460
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,660
<17-11,COLETTE>我只知道他遇上麻烦了
<17-11,COLETTE>I just know he was in trouble.

461
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,420
<17-11,COLETTE>四个礼拜前  他告诉我他要去欧洲
<17-11,COLETTE>Four weeks ago, he said he was going to Europe.

462
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,300
<17-11,COLETTE>但我一直在城里看到他
<17-11,COLETTE>But I kept seeing him in the city,

463
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,470
<17-11,COLETTE>他却一直假装没看见我
<17-11,COLETTE>and he kept pretending not to notice me.

464
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,380
<17-11,COLETTE>所以我就去监视他的公寓
<17-11,COLETTE>So I staked out his apartment.

465
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,220
<17-12,CASTLE>你跟踪了他
<17-12,CASTLE>So you stalked him?

466
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,370
<17-13,COLETTE>监视  跟踪  有什么区别
<17-13,COLETTE>Staked, stalked-- what's the difference?

467
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,270
<17-13,COLETTE>我是替他担心
<17-13,COLETTE>I was looking out for him!

468
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,860
<17-13,COLETTE>但他没有回家
<17-13,COLETTE>But he wasn't coming home.

469
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,620
<17-13,COLETTE>过了几天  我跟他对质
<17-13,COLETTE>Then a few days ago, I finally confronted him.

470
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,210
<17-13,COLETTE>他说他不方便谈话
<17-13,COLETTE>He said he couldn't talk,

471
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,110
<17-13,COLETTE>但是他让我第二天去见他
<17-13,COLETTE>but he told me to meet him the next day

472
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,900
<17-13,COLETTE>他会把一切解释清楚
<17-13,COLETTE>and he'd explain everything.

473
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,030
<17-14,BECKETT>让我猜猜
<17-14,BECKETT>Let me guess.

474
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,620
<17-14,BECKETT>之后他就没出现了
<17-14,BECKETT>That was the last time you saw him.

475
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,670
<17-15,COLETTE>不  我们第二天见了面
<17-15,COLETTE>No. We met the next day.

476
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,880
<17-15,COLETTE>但是他还没来得及说怎么回事
<17-15,COLETTE>But before he could tell me what was going on,

477
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,550
<17-15,COLETTE>突然不知从哪冲出一辆车  他们是冲我们而来
<17-15,COLETTE>this car came out of nowhere, and they were on us.

478
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,300
<17-16,CASTLE>是谁
<17-16,CASTLE>Who?

479
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,190
<17-16,CASTLE>一群头戴面罩的歹徒
<17-16,CASTLE>Ruffians in ski masks.

480
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,870
<17-17,COLETTE>他们抓住他扔进车里
<17-17,COLETTE>They grabbed him and threw him in the back.

481
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,900
<17-17,COLETTE>我奋力反抗  却没能救得了他
<17-17,COLETTE>I fought with all of my strength, but it was in vain.

482
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,060
<17-18,BECKETT>你肯定尽力了
<17-18,BECKETT>Bet you did.

483
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,290
<17-19,CASTLE>你报警了吗
<17-19,CASTLE>Did you report this?

484
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,720
<17-19,CASTLE>没有
<17-19,CASTLE>No.

485
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,720
<17-20,COLETTE>他们说如果我报警就杀了他
<17-20,COLETTE>They said they'd kill him if I did.

486
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,080
<17-20,COLETTE>所以我第二天才想要找到他
<17-20,COLETTE>That's why I was trying to find him the next day,

487
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,110
<17-20,COLETTE>看他们有没有放他走
<17-20,COLETTE>to see if they'd let him go.

488
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,080
<17-20,COLETTE>但是他们杀了他
<17-20,COLETTE>But they killed him.

489
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,420
<17-20,COLETTE>那些歹徒把他杀了
<17-20,COLETTE>The ruffians killed him.

490
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,370
<17-21,BECKETT>这些是在哪里发生的
<17-21,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. And where did this all happen?

491
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,810
<17-22,COLETTE>就在大马路上  光天化日之下
<17-22,COLETTE>On the street for all to see.

492
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,610
<17-22,COLETTE>好吧
<17-22,COLETTE>Okay.

493
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,300
<18-1,RYAN>华盛顿和格林威治两条街拐角处
<18-1,RYAN>Corner of Washington and Greenwich,

494
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,650
<18-1,RYAN>自动提款机的摄像头
<18-1,RYAN>ATM cam.

495
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,730
<18-1,RYAN>这就是科莱特说绑架发生的地方
<18-1,RYAN>This is where Colette said the abduction went down.

496
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,870
<18-1,RYAN>但我一直在看  什么都没有
<18-1,RYAN>But I've been over it, and there's nothing.

497
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,070
<18-2,BECKETT>好吧  除非你们喜欢看
<18-2,BECKETT>All right. Unless you guys are enjoying

498
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,060
<18-2,BECKETT>无聊的影像
<18-2,BECKETT>the Warhol-esque quality of this,

499
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,260
<18-2,BECKETT>我们还是把它关了吧
<18-2,BECKETT>we can just shut it down.

500
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,540
<18-2,BECKETT>我去找埃斯波西托  看看他科莱特的
<18-2,BECKETT>I'm gonna go and check on Esposito, see where he's at

501
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,530
<18-2,BECKETT>不在场证明查的怎么样了
<18-2,BECKETT>with Colette's alibi.

502
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,820
<18-3,CASTLE>等一下
<18-3,CASTLE>Wait.

503
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,000
<18-3,CASTLE>贝利出现了
<18-3,CASTLE>There's Bailey.

504
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,390
<18-4,RYAN>这个是科莱特
<18-4,RYAN>And here comes Colette.

505
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,220
<18-5,BECKETT>不是吧
<18-5,BECKETT>Seriously?

506
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,890
<18-6,CASTLE>蒙面的歹徒
<18-6,CASTLE>Ruffians in ski masks.

507
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,430
<18-7,BECKETT>开什么玩笑
<18-7,BECKETT>You gotta be kidding me.

508
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,160
<18-8,RYAN>科莱特好像打断了那人的鼻子
<18-8,RYAN>Looks like Colette just broke that ruffian's nose.

509
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,480
<18-8,RYAN>假身份
<18-8,RYAN>Fake ID,

510
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,290
<18-9,CASTLE>大把的现金
<18-9,CASTLE>bricks of cash,

511
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,770
<18-9,CASTLE>明目张胆的绑架
<18-9,CASTLE>brazen abduction...

512
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,800
<18-9,CASTLE>他真的是杰森·伯恩
<18-9,CASTLE>he really was Jason Bourne.

513
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,310
<18-9,CASTLE>开什么玩笑
<18-9,CASTLE>You gotta be kidding me.

514
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,310
<18-9,CASTLE>你看不出来吗
<18-9,CASTLE>Can't you see it?

515
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,270
<18-9,CASTLE>贝利在执行秘密任务
<18-9,CASTLE>Bailey is in covert ops.

516
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,150
<19-1,CASTLE>把他安排在一个巨型跨国公司里
<19-1,CASTLE>They placed him at a giant multinational company,

517
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,950
<19-9,CASTLE>即环球12联盟  作为掩护
<19-9,CASTLE>Global 12 Consolidated, as a cover.

518
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,510
<19-1,CASTLE>然后一个月前  他们激活了他
<19-1,CASTLE>Then a month ago, they activate him.

519
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,130
<19-1,CASTLE>给他一个化名  也就是背景故事
<19-1,CASTLE>They give him an alias, you know, a backstory.

520
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,220
<19-1,CASTLE>还有无数的活动资金
<19-1,CASTLE>They give him unlimited walking-around money,

521
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,470
<44-12,CASTLE>而之后不知如何
<44-12,CASTLE>and then somehow

522
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,930
<19-1,CASTLE>敌人找到了他
<19-1,CASTLE>the enemy gets to him.

523
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,940
<19-1,CASTLE>当街将他绑架
<19-1,CASTLE>They grab him off the streets.

524
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,210
<19-1,CASTLE>他逃了出来
<19-1,CASTLE>He manages to escape,

525
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,610
<19-1,CASTLE>而对方利用他的弱点
<19-1,CASTLE>so they exploit his achilles' heel-

526
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
<19-1,CASTLE>即喜欢漂亮女人的嗜好
<19-1,CASTLE>his love of beautiful women.

527
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,870
<19-1,CASTLE>就派了一名极其性感的特工
<19-1,CASTLE>They send in a super sexy secret agent.

528
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,640
<19-1,CASTLE>她引他上钩
<19-1,CASTLE>She seduces him,

529
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,880
<19-1,CASTLE>再给他有毒的蛋白质奶昔  置他于死地
<19-1,CASTLE>and then kills him by feeding him a poisoned protein shake.

530
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,650
<19-2,BECKETT>我真是想不出更好的解释了
<19-2,BECKETT>I can't think of anything better.

532
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,030
<19-2,BECKETT>真的
<19-2,BECKETT>Really?

533
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,150
<19-3,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<19-3,BECKETT>Okay. Thank you.

534
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,290
<19-4,BECKETT>中情局  联邦调查局
<19-4,BECKETT>The CIA, the FBI,

535
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,750
<19-4,BECKETT>和国土安全局从没听说过贝利
<19-4,BECKETT>and the DHS have never heard of Bailey

536
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,840
<19-4,BECKETT>或者他的化名
<19-4,BECKETT>or his alias.

537
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,830
<19-5,CASTLE>你真的认为若他们知道  会告诉你吗
<19-5,CASTLE>Do you really think they'd tell you if they did?

538
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,280
<19-6,RYAN>技术人员刚刚辨认出绑架者的车牌
<19-6,RYAN>Tech just got the plate number off the kidnappers' car.

539
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,200
<19-7,BECKETT>自动提款机拍下的图像
<19-7,BECKETT>I thought that the plates

540
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,460
<19-7,BECKETT>不是看不清车牌吗
<19-7,BECKETT>weren't visible on the A.T.M. footage.

541
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,030
<19-8,RYAN>确实如此  但我发现
<19-8,RYAN>They weren't, but I found

542
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,930
<19-8,RYAN>前面一个街区的摄像头拍的很清楚
<19-8,RYAN>a traffic cam up the block where they were.

543
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,400
<19-8,RYAN>车主是个叫巴普罗·贝恩斯的人
<19-8,RYAN>Car is registered to a Pablo Barnes,

544
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,890
<19-8,RYAN>28岁  保险销售员
<19-8,RYAN>28, insurance salesman.

545
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,440
<19-9,CASTLE>说不定也是个假身份
<19-9,CASTLE>That's probably a cover, too.

546
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,430
<19-10,BECKETT>有地址吗
<19-10,BECKETT>Did you get an address?

547
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,240
<19-11,RYAN>当然
<19-11,RYAN>Sure did.

548
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,620
<19-12,BECKETT>很好  我们走
<19-12,BECKETT>All right. Let's go.

549
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,450
<19-12,BECKETT>埃斯波哪去了
<19-12,BECKETT>Where's Espo?

550
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,010
<19-13,RYAN>在休息室  想找个女伴
<19-13,RYAN>In the break room trying to score his plus one.

551
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,500
<19-14,BECKETT>埃斯波  该走了
<19-14,BECKETT>Espo, let's go.

<19-15,ESPOSITO>对不起  我...
<19-15,ESPOSITO>Sorry. I gotta...

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,810
<19-15,ESPOSITO>我得走了
<19-15,ESPOSITO>I gotta go.

554
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,910
<20-1,ESPOSITO>就差这么点就能找到女伴了
<20-1,ESPOSITO>I was this close to getting my plus one.

555
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,280
<20-2,CASTLE>放松  兄弟  谁都碰到这种事
<20-2,CASTLE>Hey, relax, man. It happens to a lot of guys.

556

<20-2,CASTLE>稍微一激动  就忘了手上的蒸汽头
<20-2,CASTLE>You get a little excited, lose control of your steamer.

557
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,540

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,480
<21-1,BECKETT>你跟贝利有什么计划
<21-1,BECKETT>What were you and Bailey up to,

576
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,100
<21-1,BECKETT>你又为何杀了他
<21-1,BECKETT>and why did you kill him?

<21-3,BECKETT>我们知道你两天前绑架了他  为什么
<21-3,BECKETT>We know you kidnapped him two days ago. Why?

580
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,730
<21-4,PABLO>不  不是  事实不是你们看到那样
<21-4,PABLO>No, no, no. It's not what it looks like.

581
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,340
<21-4,PABLO>那是金蝉脱壳
<21-4,PABLO>It's an ex-stalk-tion.

582
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,670
<21-4,PABLO>脱什么壳
<21-4,PABLO>Ex-stalk-a-what?

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,020
<22-1,ESPOSITO>麦克是我们的兄弟
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Mike's our buddy.

584
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,150
<22-2,MAX>他搞上了这个疯子般跟踪他的女人
<22-2,MAX>He got involved with this crazy stalker chick--

585

586
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,340
<22-2,MAX>我们就假扮了一场绑架来吓走她
<22-2,MAX>So we staged an abduction to scare her off.

587
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,790
<22-2,MAX>我们称之为金蝉脱壳
<22-2,MAX>We call it an ex-stalk-tion.

588
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,210
<22-3,RYAN>你是说贝利也参与其中
<22-3,RYAN>Are you saying, Bailey was in on it?

589
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,680
<22-4,MAX>当然  我们三个是一个团队
<22-4,MAX>Yeah. The three of us are a crew.

590
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,380
<22-4,MAX>什么团队
<22-4,MAX>What kind of crew?

591
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,620
<23-1,BECKETT>特种部队
<23-1,BECKETT>Special forces?

592
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,670
<23-2,CASTLE>私人雇佣军
<23-2,CASTLE>Private military contractors?

593
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,250
<23-3,PABLO>我们是泡妞大师
<23-3,PABLO>We're pickup artists.

594
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,710
<23-4,CASTLE>是指泡女人吗
<23-4,CASTLE>As in... picking up women?

595
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,620
<23-4,CASTLE>你吗
<23-4,CASTLE>You?

596
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,010
<23-4,CASTLE>我们此生致力于
<23-4,CASTLE>We dedicate our lives

597
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,070
<24-1,MAX>钓到尽可能多的辣妹
<24-1,MAX>to picking up as many hot women as possible.

598
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,440
<24-2,RYAN>这就能解释贝利的那群后宫了
<24-2,RYAN>That would explain all of Bailey's women.

599
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,920
<24-3,ESPOSITO>公寓里的那些女人都很劲爆
<24-3,ESPOSITO>And those girls at the apartment were pretty hot.

600
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,830
<24-3,ESPOSITO>播放的那首曲子
<24-3,ESPOSITO>That music that was playing,

601
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,660
<24-3,ESPOSITO>也是你们的把妹绝招之一吗
<24-3,ESPOSITO>is that part of your seduction strategy?

602
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,530
<25-1,CASTLE>可不是
<25-1,CASTLE>Oh, yeah.

603
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,890
<25-2,PABLO>《波莱罗舞曲》能让
<25-2,PABLO>"Bolero" increases the chance

604
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,060
<25-2,PABLO>最终滚床单的几率增加12%
<25-2,PABLO>of closing the deal by 12%.

605
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,700
<25-3,BECKETT>假设你讲的都是真话
<25-3,BECKETT>Okay, assuming that you are telling the truth,

606
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,370
<25-3,BECKETT>麦克被杀前一晚  你们与他在一起
<25-3,BECKETT>you were with Mike the night before he was killed.

607
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,590
<25-3,BECKETT>他告诉过你他的目标吗
<25-3,BECKETT>Did he tell you what he was up to?

608
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,230
<25-4,PABLO>没有  他最近很神秘
<25-4,PABLO>Nah. He was being all secretive.

609
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,240
<25-4,PABLO>大概一个月前  不再跟我们一起出去
<25-4,PABLO>I mean, he stopped hanging out with us, like, a month ago.

610
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,630
<25-5,CASTLE>是吗  一月前
<25-5,CASTLE>Really, a month?

611
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,360
<25-6,PABLO>当他几天前  打电话来
<25-6,PABLO>Yeah, when he called about the ex-stalk-tion

612
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,080
<25-6,PABLO>要玩金蝉脱壳
<25-6,PABLO>a couple of days ago,

613
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,470
<25-6,PABLO>那是近期他第一次跟我们联系
<25-6,PABLO>that was the first time we've heard from him since then.

614
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,610
<26-1,MAX>当他说他在金蝉脱壳后要出去玩玩
<26-1,MAX>So when he said he was going out after the ex-stalk-tion,

615
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,990
<26-1,MAX>自然地  我们跟上了他
<26-1,MAX>naturally, we followed him.

616
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,030
<26-2,ESPOSITO>他去了哪
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Where'd he go?

617
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,800
<26-3,MAX>去了这家非常逊的酒吧  魔瓶
<26-3,MAX>He went to this totally lame bar--the Magic Bottle.

618
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,940
<26-3,MAX>根本没什么靓女
<26-3,MAX>I mean, not target-rich at all.

619
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,480
<26-3,MAX>等他发现我们也在
<26-3,MAX>Oh, and when he found us there,

620
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,370
<27-1,PABLO>就有点慌了  但他还是同意
<27-1,PABLO>he kinda freaked, but he agreed

621
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,950
<27-1,PABLO>让我们待着  帮他把妹
<27-1,PABLO>to let us stay and be his wingmen,

622
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,310
<27-1,PABLO>但要求我们叫他杰克
<27-1,PABLO>But only if we referred to him as Jake,

623
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,950
<27-1,PABLO>好像在干卧底似的
<27-1,PABLO>like he was undercover.

624
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,360
<27-2,CASTLE>杰克  正是他第二天
<27-2,CASTLE>Jake. That's the same identity

625
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,220
<27-2,CASTLE>告诉霍莉·富兰克林的名字
<27-2,CASTLE>he gave to Holly Franklin the next day.

626
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,920
<28-1,MAX>我们上演了几个绝招
<28-1,MAX>So we do our usual couple laps of recon.

627
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,660
<28-1,MAX>事实上  确实有几个不错的熟女
<28-1,MAX>Actually, some pretty decent milfs.

628
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,280
<28-1,MAX>我还以为麦克是想换换口味
<28-1,MAX>and I think Mike's just expanding his palate, right?

629
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,740
<28-1,MAX>但他对其中任何一个都不感兴趣
<28-1,MAX>But he wasn't interested in any of them.

630
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,200
<28-1,MAX>其实  他找到了一个目标
<28-1,MAX>No. Instead, he finds this one mark,

631
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,940
<28-1,MAX>根本没什么特别的
<28-1,MAX>like, ugh, nothing special,

632
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,620
<28-1,MAX>便决定下手
<28-1,MAX>and plants his flag.

633
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,820
<28-1,MAX>我发现她手上戴着戒指
<28-1,MAX>Then I see that she's got a ring on her finger.

634
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,820
<31-1,PABLO>她是个结了婚的女人
<31-1,PABLO>She's a married chick.

635
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,600
<31-1,PABLO>我们从不招惹结了婚的
<31-1,PABLO>We stay away from married chicks.

636
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,250
<31-2,BECKETT>你们还真有道德感
<31-2,BECKETT>'Cause you're so ethical.

637
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,070
<32-1,MAX>才不是  因为她们太麻烦
<32-1,MAX>No. They're just trouble.

638
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,490
<32-1,MAX>但他却不在乎
<32-1,MAX>But he doesn't care.

639
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,630
<32-1,MAX>他一门心思找上她
<32-1,MAX>He's all in on her.

640
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,260
<32-1,MAX>你认为他是为了这个女人到这间酒吧
<32-1,MAX>So you think he went to this bar for this particular woman,

641
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,210
<33-1,CASTLE>好像他早就瞄好了
<33-1,CASTLE>like he was targeting her?

642
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,240
<33-2,PABLO>正是
<33-2,PABLO>Exactly.

643
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
<33-3,BECKETT>他说为什么了吗
<33-3,BECKETT>Did he say why?

644
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,190
<33-3,BECKETT>没  但他使劲浑身解数
<33-3,BECKETT>No, but he was working her

645
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,740
<34-1,MAX>好像生死在此一举似的
<34-1,MAX>like his life depended on it.

646
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,460
<34-1,MAX>就好像这是他的任务
<34-1,MAX>I mean, it was like he was on a mission.

647
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,390
<34-2,RYAN>她有上钩吗
<34-2,RYAN>Did she go for him?

648
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,690
<34-2,RYAN>没  完全不搭理
<34-2,RYAN>Nah, total red light.

649
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,940
<35-1,PABLO>栏杆下  火车到  该换个目标了
<35-1,PABLO>Gate's down, train's coming, time to move on.

650
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,280
<35-1,PABLO>但麦克不这么认为
<35-1,PABLO>But not Mike.

651
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,720
<35-1,PABLO>那晚不是
<35-1,PABLO>Not on this night.

652
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,910
<35-1,PABLO>那他做了什么
<35-1,PABLO>So what did he do?

653
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,960
<36-1,MAX>他使出"满不在乎"
<36-1,MAX>He counters with some authorizing.

654
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,270
<36-2,ESPOSITO>满不在乎
<36-2,ESPOSITO>Authorizing?

655
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,080
<36-3,MAX>就是表现的好像
<36-3,MAX>You know, making it seem like

656
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,260
<36-3,MAX>他完全没有其他念想
<36-3,MAX>the last thing on his mind is hooking up.

657
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,400
<36-3,MAX>他只是觉得她有意思  想聊聊天
<36-3,MAX>He just finds her interesting and wants to talk.

658
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,530
<36-3,MAX>但她还不上钩  他就使出"移情换位"
<36-3,MAX>But she doesn't bite, so he tries an m-swig.

659
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,510
<37-1,PABLO>告诉她  他认识的一个女孩背叛了他朋友
<37-1,PABLO>Tells her he knows this girl who's cheating on his friend.

660
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,590
<37-1,PABLO>他该不该告诉他朋友
<37-1,PABLO>Should he tell his friend?

661
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,240
<37-1,PABLO>女人总是喜欢给别人建议
<37-1,PABLO>'Cause women love to give advice,

662
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,210
<38-1,MAX>但她还是没给他好脸色
<38-1,MAX>But she's still giving him the heisman,

663
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,140
<38-1,MAX>他便来招声东击西
<38-1,MAX>So he tries a butter job.

664
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,610
<38-2,ESPOSITO>怎么个声东击西法
<38-2,ESPOSITO>A butter job, what's that?

665
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,420
<38-3,MAX>就是跟目标的朋友调情
<38-3,MAX>It's when you flirt with the mark's friend.

666
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,090
<38-3,MAX>这时终于引来她的注意
<38-3,MAX>and that's when he started getting traction.

667
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,500
<39-1,PABLO>随即使出"欲擒故纵"
<39-1,PABLO>Immediately follows with a yank-and-chain reversal,

668
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,810
<39-1,PABLO>看看她是否真的上钩
<39-1,PABLO>sees he's got her on the hook.

669
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,960
<39-1,PABLO>他再拿出贝利的杀手锏
<39-1,PABLO>So he goes right for the Bailey ultimatum.

670
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,950
<39-1,PABLO>来了  他的绝招
<39-1,PABLO>Boom! Signature move.

671
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,960
<40-1,MAX>说他要走了
<40-1,MAX>Says he has to leave,

672
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,900
<40-1,MAX>迫使目标迅速做决定
<40-1,MAX>forcing the mark to make a quick decision

673
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,660
<40-1,MAX>是否要一起离开
<40-1,MAX>whether to go with you or not.

674
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,320
<41-1,CASTLE>-那她怎么做的  -下一幕便是
<41-1,CASTLE>- And what did she do? - Next thing you know,

675
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,370
<41-2,PABLO>两人一起离开那家酒吧
<41-2,PABLO>the two of them are walking on their way outta there.

676
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,050
<41-2,PABLO>你的眼睛真美
<41-2,PABLO>You know, you have some beautiful eyes.

677
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,710
<41-3,BECKETT>不是吧
<41-3,BECKETT>Seriously?

678
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,950
<41-4,PABLO>怎么了  这就是个几率问题
<41-4,PABLO>What? It's a numbers game.

679
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,750
<41-4,PABLO>90%的情况下都不会成功
<41-4,PABLO>I strike out 90% of the time.

680
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,920
<41-5,BECKETT>女人还是很有判断力的
<41-5,BECKETT>Thus restoring my faith in my gender.

681
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,660
<41-5,BECKETT>他下手的这个女人
<41-5,BECKETT>So this mark that he was working,

682
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,790
<41-5,BECKETT>知道她的名字吗
<41-5,BECKETT>does she have a name?

683
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,450
<41-6,PABLO>丽莎
<41-6,PABLO>Lisa.

684
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,960
<41-6,PABLO>这是我见过的最成功的泡妞战术
<41-6,PABLO>The greatest pickup I have ever seen.

685
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,330
<41-6,PABLO>真可惜她没能上麦克的花名册
<41-6,PABLO>It's a damn shame she'll never make it into Mike's ledger.

686
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,070
<41-7,BECKETT>什么花名册
<41-7,BECKETT>What ledger?

687
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,400
<42-1,CASTLE>里面是上百个贝利睡过的女人
<42-1,CASTLE>It's literally hundreds of women that Bailey slept with.

688
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,830
<42-2,BECKETT>他吹嘘吧
<42-2,BECKETT>Or so he claims.

689
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,450
<42-3,ESPOSITO>我觉得挺可信的
<42-3,ESPOSITO>It seems legit to me.

690
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,070
<42-3,ESPOSITO>都是艳照门级别的照片唉
<42-3,ESPOSITO>Most of these shots are pretty racy.

691
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,710
<42-4,CASTLE>都注有别名和日期
<42-4,CASTLE>All with nicknames and dates.

692
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,340
<42-4,CASTLE>2010年6月9日  "浪荡卡莉"
<42-4,CASTLE>June 9, 2010, "Carnal Carrie."

693
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,150
<42-4,CASTLE>2010年6月12日
<42-4,CASTLE>June 12, 2010,

694
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,920
<42-4,CASTLE>"神魂颠倒的玛珍"
<42-4,CASTLE>"Mesmerizing marjan."

695
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,750
<42-5,CASTLE>抱歉
<42-5,CASTLE>Whoa. Sorry.

696
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,000
<42-7,BECKETT>这上面两天前有一个叫丽莎的吗
<42-7,BECKETT>Is there a Lisa in there from two days ago?

697
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,100
<42-8,CASTLE>没有  最后一人是一个月前
<42-8,CASTLE>Uh, no. The last entry was over a month ago.

698
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,960
<42-8,CASTLE>巴普罗没说错  她确实不在里面
<42-8,CASTLE>So Pablo was right, she didn't make it in.

699
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,420
<42-9,BECKETT>我们得找到丽莎
<42-9,BECKETT>We gotta find Lisa.

700
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,790
<42-9,BECKETT>她可能就是我们要找的人
<42-9,BECKETT>She could be our other woman.

701
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,990
<42-10,RYAN>麦克斯和巴普罗的不在场证明得到证实

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,670
<42-12,ESPOSITO>但无论是啥  他真有一手
<42-12,ESPOSITO>but whatever it is, he had it going on.

<42-13,RYAN>掉入他陷阱的这些女人真是可怜
<42-13,RYAN>These women are pathetic for falling for this guy.

709
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,620
<42-13,RYAN>至于贝利  他就是个花心萝卜大骗子
<42-13,RYAN>And Bailey, Bailey was just a-a con man and a liar.

714
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,790

715
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,310
<42-14,BECKETT>以及贝利把她作为目标的原因
<42-14,BECKETT>and find out why Bailey might have been targeting her?

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,700
<42-15,CASTLE>贝克特  莱恩和珍妮到底什么时候开始约会的
<42-15,CASTLE>Beckett, when exactly did Ryan and Jenny start dating?

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,670
<43-7,RYAN>这种市中心的酒吧
<43-7,RYAN>This is a midtown bar.

736
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,110
<43-7,RYAN>来这的女人  都是冲着律师和银行家
<43-7,RYAN>Women here, they're looking for lawyers and bankers.

743
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,360

<43-10,ESPOSITO>I think I'm gonna try an m-swig.

744
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,900
<43-11,RYAN>老兄  你别开玩笑了
<43-11,RYAN>Dude, you can't be serious.

745
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,880
<43-12,ESPOSITO>那你说呢  "声东击西"吗
<43-12,ESPOSITO>What are you thinking, butter job?

746
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,460
<43-13,BARTENDER>我查了那晚是信用卡收据
<43-13,BARTENDER>I checked credit card slips from the other night.

747
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,490
<43-14,RYAN>她叫丽莎·希尔
<43-14,RYAN>Her name's Lisa Hill.

748
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,660
<43-14,RYAN>丽莎·希尔
<43-14,RYAN>Lisa hill.

749
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,950
<44-1,BECKETT>丽莎·希尔不仅已婚
<44-1,BECKETT>So not only is Lisa Hill married,

750
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,970
<44-1,BECKETT>她还是个富婆
<44-1,BECKETT>she is also an heiress--

751
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,280
<44-1,BECKETT>史黛芬妮·达斯比的女儿
<44-1,BECKETT>Daughter to Stephanie Dashby.

752
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,910
<44-2,CASTLE>达斯比出版集团吗
<44-2,CASTLE>Of Dashby publishing?

753
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,360
<44-3,BECKETT>她在福布斯富豪榜上也是榜上有名
<44-3,BECKETT>Which puts her in Forbes top 400.

754
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,580
<44-4,CASTLE>贝利这回胃口可不小
<44-4,CASTLE>Bailey was hunting big game.

755
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,790
<44-4,CASTLE>他知道初级分析员的身份不够水准
<44-4,CASTLE>He knew he couldn't close the deal as a junior analyst,

756
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,150
<44-4,CASTLE>所以就用了化名
<44-4,CASTLE>that's why he used the alias with her,

757
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,760
<44-4,CASTLE>跟搭上名流律师霍莉·富兰克林的手法如出一辙
<44-4,CASTLE>same way he used it with big-shot lawyer Holly Franklin.

758
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,930
<44-5,BECKETT>根据她女仆的证词
<44-5,BECKETT>Yeah, well, according to her maid,

759
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,940
<44-5,BECKETT>丽莎·希尔收拾了行李
<44-5,BECKETT>Lisa Hill packed up and left her apartment

760
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,850
<44-5,BECKETT>在晚上六点半离开了在蒙托克的公寓
<44-5,BECKETT>for her house in Montauk at 6:30 p.m..

761
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,450
<44-6,CASTLE>下毒时间区的半小时后
<44-6,CASTLE>Half an hour after our kill zone.

762
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,600
<44-7,BECKETT>而且她很容易便能搞到毒药
<44-7,BECKETT>Plus she also had easy access to our poison.

763
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,750
<44-7,BECKETT>她的姐姐有一家制造此药的制药厂
<44-7,BECKETT>Her sister owns a drug company that manufactures it.

764
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,080
<44-8,CASTLE>一切都是钱引起的
<44-8,CASTLE>This is about the money.

765
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,140
<44-8,CASTLE>贝利只有在接近霍莉和丽莎
<44-8,CASTLE>Bailey only used the Jake identity

766
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,070
<44-8,CASTLE>这两个富婆时  才用杰克这一身份
<44-8,CASTLE>with Holly and Lisa. They're both rich.

767
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,600
<44-9,BECKETT>所以你认为这是个敲诈骗局吗
<44-9,BECKETT>So what are you thinking, an extortion plot?

768
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
<44-10,CASTLE>那些现金  可能是之前得手的
<44-10,CASTLE>Bricks of cash--probably from previous successes.

769
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,260
<44-11,BECKETT>他以富有的女人为目标
<44-11,BECKETT>He targets wealthy women,

770
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,840
<44-11,BECKETT>试图让她们陷入困境
<44-11,BECKETT>tries to put them in compromising situations...

771
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,300
<44-12,CASTLE>然后再敲她们竹杠
<44-12,CASTLE>And then makes them pay their way out...

772
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,330
<44-13,BECKETT>不过丽莎·希尔不愿出钱
<44-13,BECKETT>Except Lisa Hill wouldn't pay.

773
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,370
<44-14,CASTLE>我们要找她来问话
<44-14,CASTLE>We need to get her in here.

774
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,480
<44-15,BECKETT>当然要
<44-15,BECKETT>And we will...

775
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,310
<44-15,BECKETT>明早第一件事
<44-15,BECKETT>First thing in the morning.

776
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,260
<44-15,BECKETT>对了
<44-15,BECKETT>So...

777
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,610
<44-16,CASTLE>我们怎么办
<44-16,CASTLE>What are we gonna do?

778
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:09,580
<44-17,BECKETT>什么事
<44-17,BECKETT>About what?

779
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,560
<44-18,CASTLE>我们得把珍妮的事告诉莱恩
<44-18,CASTLE>Well, we have to tell Ryan about Jenny.

780
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,540
<44-19,BECKETT>什么  为什么啊
<44-19,BECKETT>What? Why?

781
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,630
<44-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果是我们即将结婚
<44-19,BECKETT>Castle, if we were getting married, would you want to know

782
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,110
<44-19,BECKETT>你想知道所有跟我有过关系的男人吗
<44-19,BECKETT>about all the guys that I've slept with?

783
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,210
<44-20,CASTLE>所有吗
<44-20,CASTLE>All?

784
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,470
<44-20,CASTLE>没搞错吧
<44-20,CASTLE>Seriously?

785
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,770
<44-21,BECKETT>你在签售会上都签在女读者的胸上
<44-21,BECKETT>You sign women's chests at book readings.

786
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,830
<44-21,BECKETT>我不是处女你总不会很讶异吧
<44-21,BECKETT>You cannot be shocked that I'm not a virgin.

787
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,410
<44-22,CASTLE>我只是觉得"所有"这词
<44-22,CASTLE>It's just the word... "all"

788
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,720
<44-22,CASTLE>意味着
<44-22,CASTLE>suggests

789
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,330
<44-22,CASTLE>有很多
<44-22,CASTLE>a lot.

00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,440
<44-22,CASTLE>到底有多少人
<44-22,CASTLE>How many are we talkin'... exactly?

791
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,600
<44-23,BECKETT>你真的想知道我的数字吗
<44-23,BECKETT>Are you really asking for my number?

<44-25,BECKETT>Men.

794
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,950
<44-25,BECKETT>总是嘴上说想知道
<44-25,BECKETT>You all want to know,

795
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,300
<44-25,BECKETT>但知道了就后悔
<44-25,BECKETT>but you don't want to know.

796
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
<44-26,BECKETT>听着  每个女人都有秘密
<44-26,BECKETT>Listen, every women has their secrets,

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,200
<44-26,BECKETT>珍妮也是  而且有时
<44-26,BECKETT>including Jenny, and sometimes,

798
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,970
<44-26,BECKETT>为了维系感情  还是不追根究底为妙
<44-26,BECKETT>for the sake of a relationship, it is better not to share.

799
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,050
<45-1,CASTLE>真是件漂亮的礼服
<45-1,CASTLE>That is some dress.

800
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,950
<45-2,MARTHA>她是不是很迷人
<45-2,MARTHA>Isn't she stunning?

801
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,500
<45-3,ALEXIS>在逛了一天无果后

<45-10,MARTHA>Oh, he is a lovely young man--

817
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,570
<45-10,MARTHA>在哥伦比亚大学读大一
<45-10,MARTHA>Freshman at Columbia.

819
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,200
<45-11,ALEXIS>所以我问了他不少问题
<45-11,ALEXIS>so of course I grilled him about it.

820
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,340
<45-12,MARTHA>而接下来
<45-12,MARTHA>And the next thing you know,

821
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,070
<45-12,MARTHA>就邀请我们一起吃晚餐
<45-12,MARTHA>they invite us to join them for dinner.

822
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,880
<45-13,CASTLE>哪个是泡妞搭档
<45-13,CASTLE>So who was the wingman,

823
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,210
<45-13,CASTLE>祖父还是孙子
<45-13,CASTLE>the grandpa or the kid?

824
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:46,980
<45-14,MARTHA>什么啊
<45-14,MARTHA>The what?

825
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,040
<45-14,MARTHA>爸爸
<45-14,MARTHA>Dad,

826
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,360
<45-15,ALEXIS>他们绝对是绅士
<45-15,ALEXIS>they were total gentlemen.

827
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,200
<45-15,ALEXIS>还邀请我们参加他们家的年度慈善活动
<45-15,ALEXIS>They even invited us to their family's annual charity event--

828
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,220
<45-15,ALEXIS>Lady Gaga的私人演唱会
<45-15,ALEXIS>a private concert with Lady Gaga.

829
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,200
<45-17,ALEXIS>但跟婚礼的时间有冲突
<45-17,ALEXIS>But it's the same time as the wedding.

830
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,630
<45-18,CASTLE>我知道我答应过你
<45-18,CASTLE>I know, I promised,

831
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,020
<45-19,ALEXIS>当然如果你需要我还是会陪你  只是
<45-19,ALEXIS>and of course I'll go if you want me to, it's just--

832
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,470
<45-19,ALEXIS>自阿什利之后  我头一次有这种感觉
<45-19,ALEXIS>this is the first time I've felt this way since Ashley,

833
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,490
<45-19,ALEXIS>而且...
<45-19,ALEXIS>And...

834
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,620
<45-20,CASTLE>你不用去婚礼
<45-20,CASTLE>You don't have to go to the wedding.

835
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,480
<45-20,CASTLE>-不用来做我的女伴了  -谢谢爸爸
<45-20,CASTLE>- You are released from your plus one duties. - Thanks, dad.

836
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,990
<45-22,CASTLE>也就是说你也不需要这件礼服了
<45-22,CASTLE>Which I guess means you don't need this dress.

837
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,920
<45-23,MARTHA>别犯傻了  儿子
<45-23,MARTHA>Don't be silly, darling.

838
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,740
<45-23,MARTHA>那可是正装慈善活动
<45-23,MARTHA>It is a black-tie benefit.

839
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,450
<45-25,MARTHA>在晚餐后
<45-25,MARTHA>And after dinner,

840
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,250
<45-25,MARTHA>约翰重开店门
<45-25,MARTHA>John opened the shop...

841
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,680
<45-25,MARTHA>我也买了一件
<45-25,MARTHA>and I got one, too.

842
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,070
<45-26,CASTLE>还真是双赢啊
<45-26,CASTLE>So it's a win-win.

843
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,010
<46-1,ESPOSITO>我不敢相信你背弃了我
<46-1,ESPOSITO>I can't believe you bailed on me.

844
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,780
<46-2,RYAN>我们在那待到了凌晨两点半
<46-2,RYAN>We were there till 2:30 in the morning.

845
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,320
<46-3,ESPOSITO>我再要五分钟  就能让她
<46-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I was five minutes from sealing the deal

846
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,140
<46-3,ESPOSITO>来做我的女伴了
<46-3,ESPOSITO>with my plus one.

847
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,610
<46-4,RYAN>我们都待了三个小时了
<46-4,RYAN>You really think after standing there for three hours,

848
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,090
<46-4,RYAN>你真的觉得再多五分钟
<46-4,RYAN>another five minutes of me standing there

849
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,820
<46-4,RYAN>就能结果不同吗
<46-4,RYAN>would've made any difference?

850
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,200
<46-5,ESPOSITO>当然  她对我有意思
<46-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah. She was into me.

851
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,310
<46-6,RYAN>她说她觉得破案"挺有趣的"
<46-6,RYAN>She said that she thought solving murders was "cute."

852
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,220
<46-7,ESPOSITO>但你也不用告诉她朋友你订婚了
<46-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but you didn't have to tell her friend you were engaged.

853
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,060
<46-7,ESPOSITO>是的  你说的对
<46-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, no, no, you're right.

854
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,260
<46-8,RYAN>我完全可以瞒着她
<46-8,RYAN>I could've totally just-- just lied to her

855
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,780
<46-8,RYAN>同她鬼混
<46-8,RYAN>and hooked up with her.

856
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,160
<46-8,RYAN>你非得这样老套吗
<46-8,RYAN>And do you have to be such a cliche?

857
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,710
<46-8,RYAN>把吃的东西弄得满嘴都是
<46-8,RYAN>Stuffing your face with that-- that--that thing?

858
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,610
<46-9,ESPOSITO>别碰我的甜甜圈
<46-9,ESPOSITO>Hey, don't touch my doughnut.

859
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,170
<46-11,RYAN>-莱恩  -在我面前吃这个  我受够你了
<46-11,RYAN>- Hey, Ryan. - Eat this in front of me. I've had enough of you!

00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,390
<46-13,BECKETT>到底发生什么事了
<46-13,BECKETT>Guys! What the hell is going on?

863
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,430
<46-14,ESPOSITO>问这个先动手的饿死鬼
<46-14,ESPOSITO>Talk to hunger strike over here.

864
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,930
<46-15,RYAN>他不停地炫耀嘴里的甜甜圈
<46-15,RYAN>He was flaunting that doughnut.

865
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,070
<46-16,ESPOSITO>我只是在吃而已
<46-16,ESPOSITO>I was eating it.

866
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,520
<46-17,BECKETT>莱恩  你还好吗

<46-17,BECKETT>A cleanse for nine days--

868
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,850
<46-17,BECKETT>你认为是时候放弃了吗
<46-17,BECKETT>Don't you think it's time to let it go?

869
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,270
<46-17,BECKETT>不不不  我可以的
<46-17,BECKETT>No, no, no. I'm--I'm fine.

870
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,280
<46-18,RYAN>我很抱歉  对你们每个人  对不起兄弟
<46-18,RYAN>I'm--I'm sorry, everybody. Sorry, bro.

871

<46-20,BECKETT>我们在蒙托克的一家温泉会所找到她了
<46-20,BECKETT>Yeah, we tracked her down at a spa in Montauk.

873
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,540
<46-21,CASTLE>她踏出矿质泥潭卷入谋杀漩涡
<46-21,CASTLE>Yeah, she's going from mud wrap to murder rap,

874

878
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,350

<46-23,BECKETT>警员去带她过来了
<46-23,BECKETT>Unis are on their way to pick her up now.

880
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,230
<47-1,BECKETT>你认识他吗  希尔小姐
<47-1,BECKETT>Do you recognize him, Ms. Hill?

881
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,600
<47-2,LISA HILL>认识  他是杰克
<47-2,LISA HILL>Yes, it's Jake.

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,540
<47-2,LISA HILL>是的  是杰克·亨德里克斯
<47-2,LISA HILL>Yes, Jake Hendricks.

883
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,750
<47-3,BECKETT>准确地说  你以为是
<47-3,BECKETT>Or so you thought,

884
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,490
<47-3,BECKETT>直到你发现他真名其实是麦克·贝利
<47-3,BECKETT>until you found out his real name was Michael Bailey.

885
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,350
<47-3,BECKETT>他勒索你
<47-3,BECKETT>And he was trying to blackmail you.

886
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,530
<47-3,BECKETT>我说的对吗
<47-3,BECKETT>Isn't that right?

887
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,200
<47-4,LISA>勒索
<47-4,LISA>Blackmail?

888
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,540
<47-4,LISA>我真搞不懂你在说什么
<47-4,LISA>I...don't know what you're talking about.

889
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,760
<47-5,BECKETT>我想你懂的
<47-5,BECKETT>I think you do.

890
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
<47-5,BECKETT>你发现你被玩弄了
<47-5,BECKETT>You realized that you had been played,

891
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,530
<47-5,BECKETT>决心要报复
<47-5,BECKETT>and you decided to take your revenge.

892
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,060
<47-6,BECKETT>你姐姐有家制药厂对吗
<47-6,BECKETT>Your sister owns a, um, a drug company?

893
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,260
<47-6,BECKETT>你用来毒死他的秋水仙碱
<47-6,BECKETT>She must have given you the colchicine you used

894
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,410
<47-6,BECKETT>肯定是你姐姐给你的  对吗
<47-6,BECKETT>to poison him, didn't she?

895
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,570
<47-6,BECKETT>不  没有
<47-6,BECKETT>Uh, no.

896
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,960
<47-6,BECKETT>我没有报复
<47-6,BECKETT>Look, I didn't get revenge

897
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,930
<47-7,LISA>因为我压根不知道他在打什么主意
<47-7,LISA>because I never knew what he was up to.

898
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,880
<47-7,LISA>但他的确在打主意
<47-7,LISA>But he was up to something.

899
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,870
<47-7,LISA>当他在酒吧
<47-7,LISA>I should've realized

900
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,360
<47-7,LISA>使出浑身解数跟我搭讪我就该意识到的
<47-7,LISA>when he was hitting on me so hard at the bar.

901
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,940
<46-6,RYAN>但他善解风情
<46-6,RYAN>But he was cute,

902
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,040
<47-7,LISA>而我丈夫爱工作甚于
<47-7,LISA>and my husband is more interested in work

903
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,970
<47-7,LISA>爱生活  所以
<47-7,LISA>than actually living, so...

904
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,970
<47-7,LISA>我就带他回家了  感觉真不错
<47-7,LISA>I brought him home, and it was nice.

905
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,510
<47-7,LISA>但当我洗完澡出来时
<47-7,LISA>But then I came out of the bathroom,

906
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,840
<47-7,LISA>发现他在查看电脑
<47-7,LISA>and caught him on the computer.

907
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,200
<47-7,LISA>我想他肯定是在偷信用卡
<47-7,LISA>I figured he was trying to steal credit cards

908
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,100
<47-7,LISA>银行户头信息
<47-7,LISA>banking info,

909
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,760
<47-7,LISA>就把他赶出去了
<47-7,LISA>so I kicked his ass out.

910
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,220
<47-7,LISA>但我发誓  那是我最后一次见他
<47-7,LISA>But I swear, that was the last time I saw him.

911
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,070
<48-1,ESPOSITO>贝利给自己发了封电子邮件
<48-1,ESPOSITO>Bailey sent an e-mail, all right, to himself.

912
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,410
<48-2,BECKETT>为什么他要给自己发邮件
<48-2,BECKETT>Why would he e-mail himself?

913
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,940
<48-3,ESPOSITO>因为他在希尔的电脑上找到了几份文件
<48-3,ESPOSITO>Because he attached several documents from Hill's computer.

914
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,880
<48-4,CASTLE>什么文件
<48-4,CASTLE>What kind of documents?

915
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,340
<48-5,ESPOSITO>机密文件
<48-5,ESPOSITO>Confidential ones...

916
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,990
<48-5,ESPOSITO>关于KPM矿业公司的
<48-5,ESPOSITO>relating to K.P.W. Mining corporation.

917
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,890
<48-5,ESPOSITO>丽莎·希尔的丈夫罗恩·希尔
<48-5,ESPOSITO>Lisa Hill's husband Ron Hill

918
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,320
<48-5,ESPOSITO>是代理KPM公司可期待销售业务
<48-5,ESPOSITO>is the investment banker representing K.P.W.

919
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,530
<48-5,ESPOSITO>的投资银行家
<48-5,ESPOSITO>on the possible sale of the company.

920
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,370
<48-6,CASTLE>他是丽莎·希尔的丈夫
<48-6,CASTLE>That's Lisa Hill's husband?

921
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,510
<48-6,CASTLE>我们环球12联盟的办公室见过他
<48-6,CASTLE>We saw him at the Global 12 offices.

922
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,000
<48-7,ESPOSITO>罗恩·希尔代理KPW谈生意
<48-7,ESPOSITO>Yep, and Ron Hill is representing K.P.W.

923
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,390
<48-7,ESPOSITO>那可是价值数十亿的买卖
<48-7,ESPOSITO>It's a multibillion-dollar deal.

924
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,820
<48-8,CASTLE>那么贝利的确参与了秘密行动
<48-8,CASTLE>So Bailey was engaged in covert ops.

925
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,810
<48-8,CASTLE>他找上了罗恩·希尔的妻子丽莎
<48-8,CASTLE>He targeted Ron Hill's wife Lisa,

926
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,790
<48-8,CASTLE>同她上床从而偷到KPW公司的商业机密
<48-8,CASTLE>slept with her in order to steal K.P.W. Corporate secrets.

927
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,750
<48-9,BECKETT>他是商业间谍
<48-9,BECKETT>That's espionage.

928
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,170
<48-10,CASTLE>更像是性间谍活动
<48-10,CASTLE>More like sexpionage.

929
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,560
<48-11,BECKETT>更像动机
<48-11,BECKETT>More like motive.

930
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,630
<49-1,CASTLE>贝利利用其泡妞绝技
<49-1,CASTLE>So Bailey was using his pickup artist skills

931
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,260
<49-1,CASTLE>睡了罗恩·希尔的妻子
<49-1,CASTLE>to sleep with Ron Hill's wife

932
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,370
<49-1,CASTLE>偷到了公司机密
<49-1,CASTLE>and steal corporate secrets.

933
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,970
<49-1,CASTLE>让我想起了"深入敌后"的笑话
<49-1,CASTLE>Man, there's a "penetrating enemy lines" joke here somewhere.

934
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,100
<49-2,BECKETT>罗恩发现那些文件被偷后
<49-2,BECKETT>You know, Ron must have hit the roof

935
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,570
<49-2,BECKETT>肯定勃然大怒
<49-2,BECKETT>when he discovered that those files were stolen.

936
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,550
<49-3,CASTLE>这当然  罗恩在交易中被坑了
<49-3,CASTLE>Oh, sure. Ron got screwed on the deal.

937
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,300
<49-3,CASTLE>他妻子还被别人上了
<49-3,CASTLE>And his wife got screwed.

938
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,240
<49-3,CASTLE>要说谁有杀人动机  肯定是罗恩·希尔
<49-3,CASTLE>Boy, if anybody ever had a motive for murder, it was Ron Hill.

939
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,090
<49-4,ESPOSITO>只不过投毒谋杀时间区内
<49-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, except he was in negotiations

940
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,300
<49-4,ESPOSITO>他正在谈判
<49-4,ESPOSITO>during the poison-and-kill zone

941
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,780
<49-4,ESPOSITO>他妻子丽莎的不在场证明也被核实了
<49-4,ESPOSITO>and his wife Lisa alibied, too.

942
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,560
<49-5,RYAN>我查了KPW的交易
<49-5,RYAN>Anand I've been lookin' at the K.P.W. deal

943
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,730
<49-5,RYAN>发现由凯勒&布朗&富兰克林公司
<49-5,RYAN>turns out that they're represented

944
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,110
<49-5,RYAN>代理他们的法律事务
<49-5,RYAN>by Keller, Braun and Franklin.

945
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,310
<49-5,RYAN>猜猜谁是首席律师
<49-5,RYAN>Guess who their lead attorney is?

946
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,210
<49-6,BECKETT>霍莉·富兰克林
<49-6,BECKETT>Holly Franklin?

947
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,460
<49-7,RYAN>是的  就是酒店那位
<49-7,RYAN>Yep, Miss no-tell-hotel herself.

948
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,960
<49-7,RYAN>你们没在环球12联盟遇见她是因为
<49-7,RYAN>The only reason you guys didn't run into her

949
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,170
<49-7,RYAN>当时她被我们扣留在警局
<49-7,RYAN>at Global 12 Consolidated is that we were still holding her.

950
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,350
<49-8,BECKETT>那就解释了丽莎同霍莉的联系
<49-8,BECKETT>That explains the Lisa and Holly connection.

951
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,350
<49-9,CASTLE>是啊  这也引出了新的问题
<49-9,CASTLE>Yeah, but it begs the question,

952
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,290
<49-9,CASTLE>在这场性间谍行动中
<49-9,CASTLE>how many other women did Bailey target

953
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,240
<49-9,CASTLE>到底还有哪些女人是贝利的目标
<49-9,CASTLE>in this little sexpionage scheme?

954
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,370
<49-10,BECKETT>你俩去弄一份所有参与KPW
<49-10,BECKETT>All right, you guys get a list of all the people at K.P.W.

955
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,520
<49-10,BECKETT>交易的人员名单
<49-10,BECKETT>that were working the sale,

956
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,400
<49-10,BECKETT>-包括投资和法律团队  -好的
<49-10,BECKETT>- including the banking and legal teams. - Right.

957
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,320
<49-12,BECKETT>贝利不可能单独行动
<49-12,BECKETT>There's no way that Bailey was working this alone.

958
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,810
<49-12,BECKETT>他还太嫩
<49-12,BECKETT>He's too junior.

959
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,180
<49-13,CASTLE>而且
<49-13,CASTLE>And besides,

960
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,760
<49-13,CASTLE>他在休假
<49-13,CASTLE>he was on leave.

961
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,410
<49-14,BECKETT>谁批准的假期
<49-14,BECKETT>And who authorized the leave?

962
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,210
<50-1,HARRIS>是的  是我批准他休假的
<50-1,HARRIS>Yes, I authorized his leave.

963
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,230
<50-2,BECKETT>哈里斯先生  你给他提供了假身份证和现金红利
<50-2,BECKETT>You gave him a fake I.D. and cash bonuses, Mr. Harris.

964
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,000
<50-3,HARRIS>我跟你说过了  我对那毫不知情
<50-3,HARRIS>And I've already told you, I don't know anything about that.

965
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,910
<50-4,BECKETT>好吧  那这呢
<50-4,BECKETT>Okay, well, how about this?

966
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,040
<50-4,BECKETT>贝利为了你的谈判同霍莉·富兰克林和
<50-4,BECKETT>Bailey slept with Holly Franklin and Ron Hill's wife Lisa

967
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,710
<50-4,BECKETT>罗恩·希尔的妻子丽莎上床从而窃取KPW的商业机密
<50-4,BECKETT>to steal K.P.W. secrets for your negotiation.

968
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,050
<50-4,BECKETT>你对此知情吗
<50-4,BECKETT>Did you know about that?

969
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,300
<50-4,BECKETT>哈里斯  别装了
<50-4,BECKETT>Oh, come on, Harris.

970
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,670
<50-5,CASTLE>这不可能是贝利这菜鸟的主意
<50-5,CASTLE>This couldn't be Bailey's idea.

971
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,530
<50-5,CASTLE>你是他老板  同时也是同KPW交易中
<50-5,CASTLE>You're his boss, and you're Global 12 Consolidated's

972
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,980
<50-5,CASTLE>代表环球12联盟的首席谈判员
<50-5,CASTLE>lead negotiator for the K.P.W. deal.

973
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,010
<50-5,CASTLE>那么
<50-5,CASTLE>So...

974
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,900
<50-5,CASTLE>你是怎么想到这点子的
<50-5,CASTLE>How did it start?

975
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,100
<50-5,CASTLE>碰巧某晚你撞见贝利在酒吧
<50-5,CASTLE>Did you happen to see Bailey out one night at some bar,

976
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,600
<50-5,CASTLE>施展泡妞大法
<50-5,CASTLE>working his magic,

977
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,950
<50-5,CASTLE>使你意识到可以利用他的能力
<50-5,CASTLE>realized that you could use his ability to your advantage?

978
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,590
<50-6,HARRIS>那不过是你的胡乱猜测
<50-6,HARRIS>That is nothing but wild speculation.

979
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,540
<50-6,HARRIS>你没有证据证明我或是环球12联盟
<50-6,HARRIS>You have no proof whatsoever of any wrongdoing on my part

980
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,470
<50-6,HARRIS>有不道德行为
<50-6,HARRIS>or Global 12.

981
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,970
<50-7,BECKETT>听着  我才不关心公司渎职
<50-7,BECKETT>Look, I don't care about corporate malfeasance.

982
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,750
<50-7,BECKETT>我只想找出杀死麦克·贝利的凶手
<50-7,BECKETT>I want Michael Bailey's killer.

983
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,100
<50-8,HARRIS>你怎么知道我能帮上忙呢
<50-8,HARRIS>And how do you think I can help?

984
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,600
<50-9,BECKETT>你告诉我他上个月住在哪
<50-9,BECKETT>You tell me where he's been staying for the past month,

985
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,880
<50-9,BECKETT>告诉我他的目标还有谁
<50-9,BECKETT>tell me who else was targeted,

986
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,510
<50-9,BECKETT>在被杀那天他跟谁在一起
<50-9,BECKETT>and who he was with the day that he was killed.

987
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,370
<50-10,HARRIS>除非你要控告我什么罪名
<50-10,HARRIS>Unless you're actually gonna charge me with something...

988
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,700
<50-10,HARRIS>否则我现在就要走了
<50-10,HARRIS>I'm leaving.

989
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,780
<51-1,BECKETT>KPW有超过三百名女性高管
<51-1,BECKETT>There are more than 300 female executives at K.P.W.

990
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,690
<51-1,BECKETT>贝利有可能对其中任何一个下手
<51-1,BECKETT>Bailey could have targeted any one of them.

991
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,330
<51-2,CASTLE>更别提与交易有关的在律所和
<51-2,CASTLE>Not to mention all the women at the law firm

992
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,050
<51-2,CASTLE>投资银行工作的女性了
<51-2,CASTLE>and the investment bank who are also working on the deal.

993
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,250
<51-3,BECKETT>我们对他在哪被下毒还一无所知
<51-3,BECKETT>And we still have no idea where he was poisoned.

994
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,220
<51-4,ESPOSITO>有发现吗
<51-4,ESPOSITO>Any luck?

995
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,970
<51-5,BECKETT>没  可能同贝利睡过的女人太多了
<51-5,BECKETT>Nope. There's too big a pool of possible marks

996
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,510
<51-5,BECKETT>无从下手
<51-5,BECKETT>that Bailey could've slept with.

997
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,820
<51-6,ESPOSITO>说起这个
<51-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, uh, speaking of that,

998
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,780
<51-6,ESPOSITO>你们知道
<51-6,ESPOSITO>You know...

999
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,960
<51-6,ESPOSITO>莱恩是我兄弟
<51-6,ESPOSITO>Ryan's my boy,

1000
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,370
<51-6,ESPOSITO>所以我打算把珍妮和贝利的事告诉他
<51-6,ESPOSITO>so I gotta tell him about Jenny and Bailey.

1001
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,440
<51-7,CASTLE>你只让我别告诉莱恩
<51-7,CASTLE>You only told me I couldn't tell Ryan.

1002
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:06,290
<51-8,BECKETT>埃斯波  我同意你的观点
<51-8,BECKETT>Look, Espo, I appreciate your point of view,

1003
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,620
<51-8,BECKETT>但他已经禁食一周半了
<51-8,BECKETT>but the guy hasn't eaten in a week and a half.

1004
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,980
<51-8,BECKETT>而且在发生了甜甜圈事件后  我不
<51-8,BECKETT>And after that doughnut incident, I don't...

1005
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,180
<51-9,RYAN>我把文件拿到我桌上去看
<51-9,RYAN>I'll just take this back to my desk.

1006
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,700
<51-10,ESPOSITO>坐下  兄弟
<51-10,ESPOSITO>Sit down, bro.

1007
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,880

<51-11,RYAN>What?

1008
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,780
<51-11,RYAN>怎么了
<51-11,RYAN>What?

1009
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,210
<51-12,RYAN>你们怎么这么严肃
<51-12,RYAN>Why do you guys look so serious?

1010
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,280
<51-13,ESPOSITO>你应该吃点东西
<51-13,ESPOSITO>You should... eat something.

1011
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,120
<51-14,BECKETT>对  你看起来饿极了
<51-14,BECKETT>Yeah. You look hungry.

1012
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,150
<51-14,BECKETT>你就像只找食的流浪猫
<51-14,BECKETT>You've got the posture of a feral cat.

1013
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,490
<51-15,RYAN>我对我爱的女人发过誓的
<51-15,RYAN>Guys, I made a sacred vow to the woman I love.

1014
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,880
<51-15,RYAN>-那是木须肉吗  -是
<51-15,RYAN>- Is that moo shu pork? - Yes.

<51-16,ESPOSITO>好吃极了  兄弟  吃点吧
<51-16,ESPOSITO>And it is delicious. Come on, bro. Just eat.

1016
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,050
<51-17,RYAN>你真没骗我
<51-17,RYAN>You aren't kidding about this moohuhu pork.

1017
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,430
<51-18,ESPOSITO>-好吃  -对吧
<51-18,ESPOSITO>- Come on! - Right?

<51-20,ESPOSITO>你知道我们都很爱珍妮  对吧
<51-20,ESPOSITO>you know how we all love Jenny, right?

1021
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,670
<51-21,RYAN>知道  怎么了
<51-21,RYAN>Yeah, what about her?

1022
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,410
<51-22,ESPOSITO>就是那个
<51-22,ESPOSITO>It's just that....

1023
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,220
<51-22,ESPOSITO>贝利的那个花名册
<51-22,ESPOSITO>that ledger of Bailey's....

1024
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,100
<51-23,RYAN>珍妮在里面吗
<51-23,RYAN>Is she in that?

1025
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,440
<51-23,RYAN>我早就想问你们了  可是
<51-23,RYAN>I've been meaning to ask but

1026
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,130
<51-23,RYAN>我最近记忆力不怎么样
<51-23,RYAN>I've been having these these memory lapses.

1027
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,450
<51-23,RYAN>把炒饭递给我
<51-23,RYAN>Pass the fried rice.

1028
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,720
<51-25,CASTLE>这么说你早就知道咯
<51-25,CASTLE>So you've known all along?

1029
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,650
<51-26,RYAN>我昨晚在跟珍妮讲哈维尔的囧事
<51-26,RYAN>No, I was telling Jenny about Javier's antics last night....

1030
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,380
<51-26,RYAN>然后就聊到了这个案子
<51-26,RYAN>and we got to talk about the case.

1031
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,080
<51-26,RYAN>然后她跟我说  我们刚开始约会了一个月左右
<51-26,RYAN>And she told me that she met Bailey at a bar

1032
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,540
<51-26,RYAN>她曾在一间酒吧里遇到了贝利
<51-26,RYAN>a month or so after we started up.

1033
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,900
<51-27,ESPOSITO>她居然还告诉你这事
<51-27,ESPOSITO>She told you about that?

1034
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,130
<51-28,RYAN>是啊  她根本不知道
<51-28,RYAN>Yeah. She had no idea

1035
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,510
<51-28,RYAN>他居然是个什么泡妞大师
<51-28,RYAN>that he was some kind of professional pickup artist.

1036
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,680
<51-29,CASTLE>而你居然完全不生气
<51-29,CASTLE>And you're not upset at all?

1037
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,330
<51-30,RYAN>拜托  我们当时还没正式确立关系
<51-30,RYAN>Hey, um, it's not like we were exclusive.

1038
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,240
<51-31,RYAN>那是蒙古牛肉吗
<51-31,RYAN>Is that Mongolian beef?

1039
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,650
<51-31,RYAN>天啊
<51-31,RYAN>Oh, man.

1040
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,590
<51-32,OFFICER DI>谢谢  多特
<51-32,OFFICER DI>Oh. Thanks, Dot.

1041
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,700
<51-33,RYAN>听好咯  我一直想查清楚
<51-33,RYAN>Get this. So I've been trying to figure out

1042
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,740
<51-33,RYAN>贝利在过去的这一个月中
<51-33,RYAN>where else Bailey might have been staying

1043
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,780
<51-33,RYAN>还有可能待在哪
<51-33,RYAN>for the past month,

1044
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,480
<51-33,RYAN>当我们发现他在给他的公司
<51-33,RYAN>and when we got on to his corporate spying

1045
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,060
<51-33,RYAN>环球12联盟做间谍时
<51-33,RYAN>for Global 12 Consolidated,

1046
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,600
<51-33,RYAN>我就去调查了他们公司的住房
<51-33,RYAN>I looked into their corporate housing.

1047
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,090
<51-34,BECKETT>真是个好主意
<51-34,BECKETT>That's a great idea.

1048
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,690
<51-35,CASTLE>就是啊  我怎么没想到呢
<51-35,CASTLE>Yeah. Why didn't I think of that?

1049
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,240
<51-36,RYAN>结果发现过去的一个月以来
<51-36,RYAN>Turns out Mike Bailey has been checked in

1050
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,750
<51-36,RYAN>麦克·贝利一直用他的假名杰克·亨德里克斯
<51-36,RYAN>to the Oaks on Park Avenue for the last month

1051
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,010
<51-36,RYAN>住在派克大街的橡树大厦
<51-36,RYAN>under his alias Jake Hendricks.

1052
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,960
<51-37,BECKETT>那你还坐在这儿干吗
<51-37,BECKETT>Well, what are you sitting around for?

1053
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,880
<51-38,RYAN>我把剩下那块排骨带走吃行吗
<51-38,RYAN>Oh. Uh, do you mind if I take the spare rib?

1054
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,420
<51-38,RYAN>没问题
<51-38,RYAN>Okay.

1055
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,760
<52-1,OAKS MANAGER>你们可以随便看
<52-1,OAKS MANAGER>You're welcome to look.

1056
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,880
<52-1,OAKS MANAGER>但是我们昨天接到了电话
<52-1,OAKS MANAGER>But we got the call yesterday,

1057
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,390
<52-1,OAKS MANAGER>亨德里克斯不会回来了
<52-1,OAKS MANAGER>Mr. Hendricks wasn't coming back.

1058
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,590
<52-2,ESPOSITO>他的东西你们是怎么处理的
<52-2,ESPOSITO>What'd you do with all his stuff?

1059
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,810
<52-3,OAKS MANAGER>根据他公司的要求  我们把他的衣物
<52-3,OAKS MANAGER>Per his company's instructions, we gave his clothes

1060
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,750
<52-3,OAKS MANAGER>和私人物品都捐给慈善机构了
<52-3,OAKS MANAGER>and personal belongings to goodwill,

1061
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,060
<52-3,OAKS MANAGER>这个房间也都请人来打扫过了  床单也都换过了
<52-3,OAKS MANAGER>and the place has been scrubbed, bedding laundered.

1062
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,070
<52-4,RYAN>哈维尔  看看这个
<52-4,RYAN>Hey, Javier, check this out.

1063
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,150
<52-4,RYAN>巧克力旋风
<52-4,RYAN>Chocolate blast.

1064
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,180
<52-4,RYAN>这是蛋白质饮品
<52-4,RYAN>It's a protein shake.

1065
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,200
<52-4,RYAN>原料是乳清分离蛋白
<52-4,RYAN>"Made with whey-protein isolate."

1066
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,050
<52-5,ESPOSITO>你们一直把这种饮品放在冰箱里吗
<52-5,ESPOSITO>You always stock this drink?

1067
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,460
<52-6,OAKS MANAGER>是的  这都是标准配备
<52-6,OAKS MANAGER>Yeah. It's all standard.

1068
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,630
<52-7,RYAN>蕾妮说导致贝利中毒死亡的秋水仙碱
<52-7,RYAN>It's exactly what Lanie said that Bailey had in his system

1069
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,130
<52-7,RYAN>正是混在这种饮品里的
<52-7,RYAN>that delivered the colchicine.

1070
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,810
<52-8,ESPOSITO>他就是在这里被人下毒的  兄弟
<52-8,ESPOSITO>This is where he was poisoned, bro.

1071
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,800
<53-1,BECKETT>看来我们找到凶器了
<53-1,BECKETT>Looks like we found the murder weapon.

1072
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,160
<53-1,BECKETT>蕾妮说从橡树大厦拿回来的巧克力奶昔的成分
<53-1,BECKETT>Lanie says that the chocolate shake from the Oaks

1073
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,270
<53-1,BECKETT>与贝利胃里的残留物成分
<53-1,BECKETT>is a perfect match for the contents

1074
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,010
<53-1,BECKETT>完全匹配
<53-1,BECKETT>of Bailey's stomach.

1075
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,450
<53-1,BECKETT>这就是掺有致命剂量的秋水仙碱的饮品
<53-1,BECKETT>It's what delivered the lethal dose of colchicine.

1076
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,890
<53-2,ESPOSITO>橡树大厦的门卫已经证实了
<53-2,ESPOSITO>So the doorman at the Oaks confirms

1077
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,520
<53-2,ESPOSITO>贝利在预测投毒时间内一直待在他的房间里
<53-2,ESPOSITO>that Bailey was there during the whole poison time window.

1078
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,680
<53-2,ESPOSITO>他叫人不要打扰他
<53-2,ESPOSITO>He asked not to be disturbed.

1079
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,000
<53-3,CASTLE>那是肯定的了  因为性间谍活动
<53-3,CASTLE>Yeah, I bet, because sexpionage

1080
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,430
<53-3,CASTLE>可比普通的间谍活动费时费心
<53-3,CASTLE>can be so much more demanding than espionage.

1081
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,100
<53-4,ESPOSITO>这倒是
<53-4,ESPOSITO>True.

1082
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,410
<53-5,BECKETT>那也就是说有人来访
<53-5,BECKETT>So I'm guessing he had a visitor.

1083
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,980
<53-6,RYAN>是的  这个人以前也曾去过好几次
<53-6,RYAN>Yep, someone who had been there a few times before.

1084
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,860
<53-6,RYAN>这是监控摄像头拍到的照片
<53-6,RYAN>Security cam photo capture.

1085
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,340
<53-7,CASTLE>眼熟吗
<53-7,CASTLE>Look familiar?

1086
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,770
<54-1,RON HILL>如果我们专注于第三季度的话
<54-1,RON HILL>If we could focus on the third quarter,

1087
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,140
<54-1,RON HILL>相信将能以
<54-1,RON HILL>I believe that would be

1088
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,520
<54-1,RON HILL>最有成效的方式推动进展
<54-1,RON HILL>the most productive way to move forward.

1089
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,360
<54-2,BECKETT>打扰一下
<54-2,BECKETT>Excuse me.

1090
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,370
<54-2,BECKETT>抱歉再度打扰了
<54-2,BECKETT>Sorry to interrupt again.

1091
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,110
<54-3,AMY>怎么了  赛斯
<54-3,AMY>What's up, Seth?

1092
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,990
<54-4,HARRIS>没事  什么事都没有
<54-4,HARRIS>Nothing. Nothing at all.

1093
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,950
<54-4,HARRIS>探长  我已经把我对麦克·贝利
<54-4,HARRIS>Look, detective, I have already told you

1094
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,250
<54-4,HARRIS>所了解的一切都告诉你了
<54-4,HARRIS>everything that I know about Michael Bailey.

1095
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,270
<54-4,HARRIS>所以请你们
<54-4,HARRIS>Now please...

1096
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,440
<54-4,HARRIS>离开吧
<54-4,HARRIS>leave.

1097
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,160
<54-5,BECKETT>实际上  我们不是来找你的  哈里斯先生
<54-5,BECKETT>Actually, we're not here for you, Mr. Harris.

1098
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,880
<54-6,CASTLE>不过我们过会儿就会要找你了
<54-6,CASTLE>That would be the S.E.C, soon.

1099
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,790
<54-7,BECKETT>今天
<54-7,BECKETT>Today...

1100
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,370
<54-7,BECKETT>我们是来找一位女士的
<54-7,BECKETT>we are here for a woman,

1101
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,510
<54-8,BECKETT>一位KPW的雇员
<54-8,BECKETT>someone who works for K.P.W.

1102
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,680
<54-8,BECKETT>她还认识麦克·贝利
<54-8,BECKETT>and also knew Michael Bailey --

1103
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,920
<54-8,BECKETT>也就是你的首席运营官  艾米·坎普
<54-8,BECKETT>your C.O.O, Amy Kemp.

1104
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,030
<54-8,BECKETT>你因谋杀麦克·贝利而被捕了
<54-8,BECKETT>You're under arrest for the murder of Michael Bailey.

1105
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,850
<54-9,AMY>很高兴与你合作  赛斯
<54-9,AMY>Pleasure doing business with you, Seth.

1106
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,570
<54-9,AMY>走吧
<54-9,AMY>Let's go.

1107
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,310
<55-1,CASTLE>她说"杀他只是为公事"
<55-1,CASTLE>She said "killing him was just business".

1108
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,620
<55-1,CASTLE>为了保护商业机密  他必须死掉
<55-1,CASTLE>He had to die to protect the corporate secrets.

1109
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,070
<55-2,BECKETT>是啊  我想他不能再到处
<55-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I guess the fact that he won't be around

1110
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,560
<55-2,BECKETT>骗其他的女人算是附加的好处了
<55-2,BECKETT>to dupe other women was an added benefit.

1111
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,580
<55-2,BECKETT>贝利对她使了他对所有女人都使的那套把戏
<55-2,BECKETT>Bailey worked her like all the other women --

1112
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,080
<55-2,BECKETT>让她以为自己是特别的
<55-2,BECKETT>made her feel special,

1113
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,730
<55-2,BECKETT>使她爱上了他  但是就在这个过程中
<55-2,BECKETT>got her to fall for him -- but somewhere along the way,

1114
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,490
<55-2,BECKETT>她发现了他的真实目的
<55-2,BECKETT>she figured out what he was up to.

1115
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,070
<55-3,RYAN>我真是庆幸我不用再玩那套把戏了
<55-3,RYAN>I'm just glad I'm out of the game.

1116
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,050
<55-4,CASTLE>我的朋友  对于你  这套把戏才刚刚开始
<55-4,CASTLE>The games are only beginning for you, my friend.

1117
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,420
<55-5,BECKETT>你找到婚礼的女伴了吗
<55-5,BECKETT>Hey. So what's up with your plus one?

1119
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,380
<55-6,ESPOSITO>我目前只能透露这么多
<55-6,ESPOSITO>That's all I'm sayin'.

<56-10,ESPOSITO>Toby, huh?

1132
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,800

<56-11,LANIE>What do you mean, "Toby, huh?"

1133
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,200
<56-12,ESPOSITO>不知道  该问你啊
<56-12,ESPOSITO>I don't know. You tell me.

1134
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,990
<56-13,LANIE>咱俩两个月前就分手了
<56-13,LANIE>You and I broke up two months ago,

1135
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,160
<56-13,LANIE>除非你认为我准备这辈子做修女
<56-13,LANIE>so unless you thought I joined a convent,

1136
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,540
<56-13,LANIE>不然你最好还是别搀合
<56-13,LANIE>you need to take a step back.

1137
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,210
<56-14,ESPOSITO>-这么说你们俩是来真的了  -没错
<56-14,ESPOSITO>- So you two serious now?  - Yeah, we're serious...

00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,420
<56-15,LANIE>我们都真的很热爱跳舞
<56-15,LANIE>Mm-hmm. About dancing.

1139
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,460
<56-15,LANIE>所以他男朋友才肯把他借给我
<56-15,LANIE>That's why his boyfriend let me borrow him.

1140
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,980
<56-15,LANIE>再说了  我心想你跟珍妮的那些
<56-15,LANIE>Besides, I figured I'd need somebody to keep me company

1141
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,410
<56-15,LANIE>联谊会姐妹们打情骂俏时  我最好有人作伴
<56-15,LANIE>while you flirted with all of Jenny's sorority sisters.

1142
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,850
<56-16,ESPOSITO>托比的男朋友
