<1-2,MARK>我再也不想来拍抗议了
<1-2,MARK>I'm so over this protest.

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,090
<1-6,MARK>去别地方敲行不行
<1-6,MARK>How about you take it somewhere else?

<19-2,LEANN WEST>I'm here at Boylan Plaza

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,910
<19-3,NEWCASTER>现在是占领抗议的第36天
<19-3,NEWCASTER>on day 36 of the takeover protest.

21
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,980
<19-4,LEANN>不仅在此  全国各地都有数百人聚集
<19-4,LEANN>Hundreds have gathered here and in other cities across the country

22
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,030
<19-4,LEANN>抗议他们所谓的贪婪和腐败
<19-4,LEANN>to take a stand against what they say is greed and corruption.

23
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:50,940
<19-4,LEANN>我的天啊
<19-4,LEANN>Oh, my god.

24
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,480
<1-5,LEANN>如果你刚调到本频道
<1-5,LEANN>If you just tuned in,

25
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,310
<1-6,MARK>刚刚发生了一起爆炸
<1-6,MARK>there's been some kind of explosion

26
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,880
<1-7,MARK>就在博亦伦广场的东南角上
<1-7,MARK>on the southeast side of the Boylan Plaza.

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,080
<1-8,LEANN>我们尚不清楚爆炸起因和伤亡情况
<1-8,LEANN>We do not know what caused this or if there are injuries,

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,410
<1-9,LEANN>但是我能看到  似乎有人
<1-9,LEANN>but I can see what appear to be people

29
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,120
<1-9,LEANN>躺在地上  一动不动
<1-9,LEANN>on the ground, not moving.

34
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,490
<1-9,LEANN>真难以置信
<1-9,LEANN>This is unbelievable.

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,970
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>知道死亡人数吗
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Any idea how many people were killed?

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,570
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>初步报告为五人死亡  28人受伤
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Initial reports say five dead, 28 injured.

37
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,590
<2-3,CASTLE>到处是联调局的人
<2-3,CASTLE>There's Feds everywhere.

38
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,290
<2-4,BECKETT>发生爆炸案  这是常规程序
<2-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that's normal procedure in the event of a bomb.

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,150
<2-5,CASTLE>这可绝不是常规事件
<2-5,CASTLE>There's nothing normal about this.

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,580
<2-6,LEANN>探长  警方是否知道幕后黑手是谁
<2-6,LEANN>Detective, do the police know who's behind this?

41
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,220
<2-6,LEANN>警方是否怀疑这是恐怖袭击
<2-6,LEANN>Do they think this was a terrorist attack?

42
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,320
<2-7,BECKETT>无可奉告  你们得去找新闻部
<2-7,BECKETT>No comment. You'll have to deal with press relations.

47
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,650
<2-8,AGENT JOHNSON>-抱歉  请止步  -纽约警局的
<2-8,AGENT JOHNSON>- Oh, sorry. - NYPD.

48
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,310
<2-10,AGENT JOHNSON>纽约警局去那边
<2-10,AGENT JOHNSON>NYPD's over there.

49
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,100
<2-10,AGENT JOHNSON>联调局已接手犯罪现场的管辖权
<2-10,AGENT JOHNSON>FBI has taken jurisdiction of the crime scene.

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,520
<2-11,BECKETT>多谢
<2-11,BECKETT>Thanks.

51
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,910
<2-11,BECKETT>走吧  卡塞尔
<2-11,BECKETT>Come on, Castle.

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,170
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>联调局也把你们挡回来了  是吗
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>FBI turned you guys away, too, huh?

53
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,290
<3-2,CASTLE>是啊  他们不让我们过警戒线
<3-2,CASTLE>Yeah, they wouldn't let us past the crime scene tape.

54
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,960
<3-2,CASTLE>怎么回事
<3-2,CASTLE>What's going on?

55
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,050
<3-3,KEVIN RYAN>盖茨在跟联调局交涉
<3-3,KEVIN RYAN>Gates is talking to the Feds,

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,260
<3-3,KEVIN RYAN>处理这个问题
<3-3,KEVIN RYAN>trying to get a handle on that.

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,780
<3-4,BECKETT>爆炸案有什么进展吗  谁引爆了炸弹
<3-4,BECKETT>What do we know about the explosion, who set it off?

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,210
<3-5,ESPOSITO>大概不是自杀爆炸
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Well, it probably wasn't a suicide bomber.

59
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,480
<3-5,ESPOSITO>我有个朋友是医务人员
<3-5,ESPOSITO>I got a friend who's a medic,

60
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,830
<3-5,ESPOSITO>说没在任何尸体上发现炸弹背心
<3-5,ESPOSITO>said that there were no explosive vests on any of the bodies.

61
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,570
<3-6,RYAN>目前其他事还都是谣传
<3-6,RYAN>Everything else is just rumor at this point.

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,350
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>大伙儿听好了
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Listen up, people.

63
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,700
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我们还在拼凑事情经过
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>We're still piecing together what happened here.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,350
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>但我能告诉大家  联调局和国土安全局
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>But what I can tell you-- FBI and Homeland Security

65
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,250
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>将负责本次调查
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>will be taking point on this investigation.

66
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,740
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>纽约警局将协助调查
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>NYPD will act in a support capacity.

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,280
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我们首要任务
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Our first assignment

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,770
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>是查明是否有哪个死者
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>is to determine if any of the victims

69
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,870
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>因为参与抗议而成为袭击目标
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>were targeted because of their involvement in the protest.

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,610
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>这会儿警员正在把亲属带往分局
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Uniforms are bringing families to the precinct as we speak,

71
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,710
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我们去安慰他们  做好本职工作吧
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>so... let's go hold some hands and do our jobs.

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,850
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>莱文先生
<3-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Mr. Levine,

73
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,660
<4-1,BECKETT>据我所知  有位死者
<4-1,BECKETT>I understand that one of the victims,

74
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,850
<4-1,BECKETT>杰西·弗里德曼  生前跟你密切合作
<4-1,BECKETT>Jesse Friedman, worked closely with you.

75
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,600
<4-2,LAVINE>不止是合作
<4-2,LAVINE>It was more than that.

76
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,490
<4-2,LAVINE>他是我的朋友  我的战友
<4-2,LAVINE>He was a friend, a comrade in arms, you know?

77
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,590
<4-2,LAVINE>杰西负责招纳抗议者
<4-2,LAVINE>Jesse was a recruiter.

78
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,540
<4-2,LAVINE>几周前  参加抗议的人数减少时
<4-2,LAVINE>When attendance dropped a few weeks back,

79
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,960
<4-2,LAVINE>连我也以为该结束了
<4-2,LAVINE>even I thought it was time to pack up,

80
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,120
<4-2,LAVINE>但是杰西却引用了我最喜欢的名言
<4-2,LAVINE>but Jesse just threw my favorite quote back at me.

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,020
<4-2,LAVINE>就是那个沉默是罪恶
<4-2,LAVINE>The one about sinning by silence.

82
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,190
<4-3,BECKETT>"该抗议时  沉默即是罪恶
<4-3,BECKETT>"To sin by silence when we should protest

84
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,140
<4-3,BECKETT>沉默即是懦弱"
<4-3,BECKETT>makes... cowards of men."

85
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,990
<5-1,RYAN>我们知道你现在一定很难过
<5-1,RYAN>We know that this is difficult,

86
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,500
<5-1,RYAN>但是你丈夫在占领活动中扮演什么角色
<5-1,RYAN>but what was your husband's involvement with the takeover movement?

87
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,680
<5-2,VAL BROOKSTONE>马特没参与活动  我也没有
<5-2,VAL BROOKSTONE>Matt wasn't involved. Neither am I.

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,510
<5-3,ESPOSITO>那你们为什么会在博亦伦广场
<5-3,ESPOSITO>So why were you at Boylan Plaza?

89
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,280
<5-4,VAL>我们第一次来这儿
<5-4,VAL>It's our first time here.

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,080
<5-4,VAL>想尽量多看些地方
<5-4,VAL>We wanted to take in as much as we could.

91
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,860
<5-5,RYAN>你们是游客
<5-5,RYAN>You're tourists?

92
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,020
<5-6,VAL>我们刚刚登过帝国大厦的楼顶
<5-6,VAL>We'd just been to the top of the Empire State Building.

93
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,250
<5-6,VAL>还有点剩余的时间
<5-6,VAL>We had an extra few minutes,

94
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,430
<5-6,VAL>就决定去看看抗议活动是怎么回事
<5-6,VAL>so we decided to see what the protest was all about.

95
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,130
<5-7,VAL>马特和我刚刚买了房子
<5-7,VAL>Matt and I just bought a house.

96
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,520
<5-7,VAL>我们要建立一个家庭了
<5-7,VAL>We were going to start a family.

97
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,250
<5-7,VAL>我们都做了计划
<5-7,VAL>We had all these plans.

98
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,830
<5-7,VAL>我现在要怎么办
<5-7,VAL>What am I gonna do now?

99
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,220
<6-1,BECKETT>你没事吧
<6-1,BECKETT>You good?

100
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,610
<6-2,CASTLE>没事
<6-2,CASTLE>Yeah, yeah.

101
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,840
<6-2,CASTLE>就是这起案子
<6-2,CASTLE>It's just this case, you know?

102
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,800
<6-2,CASTLE>真让人难过
<6-2,CASTLE>It kind of gets to you.

103
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,490
<6-2,CASTLE>剩下几个家庭问的怎么样了
<6-2,CASTLE>How'd it go with the rest of the families?

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,950
<6-3,BECKETT>一个死者是家里第一个上大学的孩子
<6-3,BECKETT>Um, one victim was the first kid in his family to go to college,

105
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,250
<6-3,BECKETT>另一个是两个孩子的母亲
<6-3,BECKETT>and the other was a mother of two, so...

106
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
<6-3,BECKETT>你能想象得出
<6-3,BECKETT>about like you'd expect.

107
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,470
<6-3,BECKETT>不过似乎没有人是袭击目标
<6-3,BECKETT>No one seems to have been targeted, though.

108
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,360
<6-4,CASTLE>那么他们的死是偶然的了
<6-4,CASTLE>So their deaths were random.

109
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,760
<6-4,CASTLE>我们之前接触的大部分的被害人
<6-4,CASTLE>You know, most of our victims, they...

110
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,900
<6-4,CASTLE>他们的死都有原因
<6-4,CASTLE>they die for a reason.

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,800
<6-4,CASTLE>背后都有某种动机
<6-4,CASTLE>You know, there's a logic behind it.

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,880
<6-4,CASTLE>有时动机很扭曲
<6-4,CASTLE>It's a twisted logic at times,

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,050
<6-4,CASTLE>但好歹也能说得通
<6-4,CASTLE>but... at least it makes some kind of sense.

114
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,090
<6-5,BECKETT>但是这件案子
<6-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but in this case,

115
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,630
<6-5,BECKETT>这些人只是在错误的时间待在错误的地方
<6-5,BECKETT>these people were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,740
<6-6,CASTLE>他们的未来和他们计划
<6-6,CASTLE>And their future and all their plans,

117
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,640
<6-6,CASTLE>伴随刹那的光亮灰飞烟灭
<6-6,CASTLE>everything is just gone in a flash.

118
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,340
<6-7,BECKETT>让人想到自己生命中的那些
<6-7,BECKETT>It makes you think about all those things in your own life

119
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,200
<6-7,BECKETT>不想再耽误下去的事情
<6-7,BECKETT>that you don't want to put off anymore.

120
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,760
<6-7,BECKETT>警监叫大家集合
<6-7,BECKETT>Captain's gathering the troops.

121
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,420
<7-1,GATES>现在看来这起袭击
<7-1,GATES>Now that it appears that this attack

122
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,860
<7-1,GATES>并不是针对任何一个人的
<7-1,GATES>was not directed at any specific individual,

123
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,230
<7-1,GATES>联调局给了我们新的任务
<7-1,GATES>we've got a new assignment from the FBI.

124
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,130
<7-1,GATES>我们都知道炸弹在哪爆炸
<7-1,GATES>We all know where the bomb went off.

125
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,170
<7-1,GATES>就在这儿  紧挨着这个街灯
<7-1,GATES>It was here, right next to this lamppost.

126
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,540
<7-1,GATES>联调局刚刚从一个抗议者的
<7-1,GATES>The FBI just recovered this photo

127
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,160
<7-1,GATES>手机里获取了这张照片
<7-1,GATES>from a protester's cell phone.

128
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,660
<7-1,GATES>是同一地点
<7-1,GATES>It's of the same location,

129
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,330
<7-1,GATES>拍摄时间是
<7-1,GATES>taken 47 seconds...

130
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,180
<7-1,GATES>爆炸前47秒
<7-1,GATES>before the explosion.

131
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,830
<7-1,GATES>这只说明一件事
<7-1,GATES>That could only mean one thing.

132
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,430
<7-1,GATES>炸弹是有人放在那里的
<7-1,GATES>The bomb was placed here by someone

133
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,560
<7-3,GATES>就在47秒的时间范围内
<7-3,GATES>within our 47-second time period.

134
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,640
<7-1,GATES>我们的任务是
<7-1,GATES>Our task is to interview

135
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,420
<5-3,ESPOSITO>逐一盘问博亦伦广场上的目击证人
<5-3,ESPOSITO>all witnesses who were present at Boylan Plaza.

136
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,330
<7-1,GATES>我们要找出任何看到爆炸之前
<7-1,GATES>We are looking for anyone who saw what went on

137
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,670
<7-1,GATES>街灯附近情况的人
<7-1,GATES>by this lamppost before the blast.

138
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,060
<7-2,BECKETT>长官  名单上有三百余人
<7-2,BECKETT>Sir, there are over 300 names on this list.

139
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
<7-2,BECKETT>我们要如何进行
<7-2,BECKETT>How do you recommend that we proceed?

140
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,060
<7-3,GATES>多叫些人手来
<7-3,GATES>We bring in more shifts.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,540
<7-3,GATES>这些人中
<7-3,GATES>Someone on that list

142
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
<7-3,GATES>有人目睹了那47秒内炸弹被放在那儿
<7-3,GATES>saw the bomb being planted within our 47-second window.

143
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,870
<7-3,GATES>我们找到这人  就能找到炸弹客
<7-3,GATES>We find that person, we find the bomber.

153
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,930
<8-1,BECKETT>谢谢你的配合
<8-1,BECKETT>Thank you for your time.

154
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,710
<8-2,BECKETT>这真是毫无帮助
<8-2,BECKETT>Well, that was unhelpful.

155
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,210
<8-3,CASTLE>是啊  我看出其中的规律来了
<8-3,CASTLE>Yeah. I'm starting to sense a pattern.

156
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,640
<8-4,BECKETT>接下来这个女人声称
<8-4,BECKETT>You know, this next woman says

157
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,310
<8-4,BECKETT>她当时就在爆炸现场中心
<8-4,BECKETT>that she was in the middle of the whole thing.

158
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,120
<8-4,BECKETT>我们当时就在这
<8-4,BECKETT>We were right here.

159
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,960
<9-1,CORINNE>炸弹就像是在我们身边炸开似的
<9-1,CORINNE>It's like the bomb went off right next to us.

160
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,030
<9-2,CASTLE>"我们"是谁
<9-2,CASTLE>Who's we?

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
<9-3,CORINNE>她在外边等着呢
<9-3,CORINNE>She's out there right now waiting.

163
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
<9-3,CORINNE>用我去叫她吗
<9-3,CORINNE>Should I go get her?

164
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,390
<9-4,BECKETT>不用了  我们最好进行一对一的谈话
<9-4,BECKETT>Uh, no, actually, it's better if we just talk one-on-one.

165
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,340
<9-4,BECKETT>你们两个人参加抗议了吗
<9-4,BECKETT>Now were the two of you participating in the protests?

166
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,340
<9-5,CORINNE>我看起来像是劳苦大众吗
<9-5,CORINNE>Do I look like I'm in the 99%?

167
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,450
<9-5,CORINNE>没有  我们刚离开广场附近的婚礼精品店
<9-5,CORINNE>No. We'd just left this bridal boutique near the plaza.

168
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,940
<9-5,CORINNE>娜迪亚六月份结婚
<9-5,CORINNE>Nadia's getting married in June.

169
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,080
<9-6,BECKETT>你注意到街灯旁有人吗
<9-6,BECKETT>And did you notice anyone standing near the light post?

170
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,640
<9-7,CORINNE>没看见
<9-7,CORINNE>I don't think so.

171
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,740
<9-8,BECKETT>好的  请告诉我们
<9-8,BECKETT>Okay, well, I'm gonna need you to tell us

172
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,190
<9-8,BECKETT>炸弹爆炸之前你能回忆起来的一切
<9-8,BECKETT>everything that you remember from just before the bombing,

173
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,320
<9-8,BECKETT>从你当时的位置说起
<9-8,BECKETT>starting with where you were.

174
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,940
<9-9,CORINNE>我们当时在咖啡摊
<9-9,CORINNE>We were at the coffee truck,

175
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,540
<9-9,CORINNE>商量下一步去哪
<9-9,CORINNE>just trying to figure out our next move.

176
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,030
<10-1,CORINNE>我有点走不动了  娜迪亚
<10-1,CORINNE>I'm a little shopped out, Nadia.

177
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,870
<10-1,CORINNE>你试了整整11件婚纱
<10-1,CORINNE>I mean, you tried on 11 dresses.

179
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,730
<10-2,NADIA>他们把我弄得像棉花糖巨怪似的
<10-2,NADIA>They made me look like a stay puft marshmallow.

180
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,620
<10-2,NADIA>我们还得继续逛
<10-2,NADIA>We have to keep looking.

181
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,400
<10-3,CORINNE>我们不能回家上网找吗
<10-3,CORINNE>Can we look from home online?

182
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,530
<10-4,NADIA>我才不在网上买我的婚纱呢
<10-4,NADIA>I'm not buying my wedding dress on the internet.

183
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,340
<10-5,CORINNE>就是找点灵感  我们得重新部署
<10-5,CORINNE>It's just to give us ideas. We need to regroup.

184
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,250
<10-5,CORINNE>你离难缠新娘就差那么一步了
<10-5,CORINNE>You are this close to Bridezilla territory.

185
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,230
<10-6,NADIA>或许结婚时我会穿牛仔裤
<10-6,NADIA>Oh, maybe I'll wear jeans to my wedding.

186
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,920
<10-6,NADIA>我们可以雇那个人当乐队
<10-6,NADIA>Maybe we can hire that guy as the band.

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,160
<10-7,JESSE>那是我的  还给我
<10-7,JESSE>That's mine! Give that back!

<10-8,CORINNE>Could you imagine the look on mom's--

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,890
<10-8,CORINNE>靠
<10-8,CORINNE>Damn it!

<10-9,NADIA>走路看道啊  这是我的
<10-9,NADIA>Watch where you're going. This is my--

191
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,140
<11-1,CORINNE>爆炸的冲击力把我们俩都撞倒在地
<11-1,CORINNE>The force of it knocked us on our asses.

192
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,480
<11-1,CORINNE>娜迪亚差点被踩到
<11-1,CORINNE>Nadia almost got trampled.

193
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,640
<11-2,BECKETT>等等  你能重新说一下
<11-2,BECKETT>Wait. Can you go back to the--

<11-2,BECKETT>手拿盒子那个中东男人
<11-2,BECKETT>The middle eastern man carrying the box.

195
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,710
<11-2,BECKETT>你说他浑身是汗  而且很紧张
<11-2,BECKETT>You said that he was sweaty and nervous?

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,990
<11-3,CASTLE>他正往街灯方向走
<11-3,CASTLE>And was he headed toward the lamppost?

197
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,960
<11-4,CORINNE>是的
<11-4,CORINNE>Yeah.

<11-5,BECKETT>Do you remember his face well enough to help us with a sketch?

<12-5,ESPOSITO>你离炸弹爆炸地点有50米远
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Well, that puts you 50 feet away from where the bomb went off.

209
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,730
<12-5,ESPOSITO>你能清楚地看到这个街灯吗

<15-1,ESPOSITO>-贝多芬了  -是的
<15-1,ESPOSITO>- in the plaza this afternoon? - Oh, yeah.

227
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,350
<15-2,WESTSIDE WALLY>我打赌这半聋的混蛋
<15-2,WESTSIDE WALLY>And I bet that half-deaf bastard

228
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,410
<15-2,WESTSIDE WALLY>是这件事的幕后黑手
<15-2,WESTSIDE WALLY>is behind all this.

<15-4,WESTSIDE WALLY>你说没线索是什么意思
<15-4,WESTSIDE WALLY>What do you mean, we have no leads?

232
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,710
<16-1,GATES>那个中东男人又是怎么回事
<16-1,GATES>What about the middle eastern man?

233
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,430
<16-2,BECKETT>我们问过他了  他被排除嫌疑了
<16-2,BECKETT>We interviewed him. He cleared.

234
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,680
<16-3,CASTLE>他拿着的盒子里边都是中国外卖
<16-3,CASTLE>Yeah, that box he was carrying-- full of chinese takeout.

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
<16-3,CASTLE>那里面最危险的东西就是味精
<16-3,CASTLE>Most dangerous thing in there was M.S.G.

236
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,130
<16-4,BECKETT>事实上我们采访了94个人
<16-4,BECKETT>Look, the fact is, is that we interviewed 94 people,

237
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,930
<16-4,BECKETT>却毫无结果
<16-4,BECKETT>and we've got nothing to show for it.

238
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,210
<16-5,GATES>这不是我想要得到的结果
<16-5,GATES>Uh, this is not the news I was hoping for,

239
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,730
<16-5,GATES>尤其是联调局还送来了这个
<16-5,GATES>especially since the FBI sent this over.

240
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
<16-5,GATES>一个小时前  这封电邮被发往
<16-5,GATES>It was e-mailed to two other takeover locations

241
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,860
<16-5,GATES>纽约的另两处抗议地点
<16-5,GATES>in New York an hour ago.

242
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,360
<16-6,BECKETT>"已警告你们停止抗议
<16-6,BECKETT>"You were warned to stop the protests.

243
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,380
<16-6,BECKETT>你们不听
<16-6,BECKETT>You didn't listen.

244
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,710
<16-6,BECKETT>这回该听劝了
<16-6,BECKETT>Start listening now

245
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,150
<16-6,BECKETT>否则今天的爆炸将只是个开始"
<16-6,BECKETT>or today's bombing will be just the beginning."

246
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,100
<16-7,CASTLE>他还要袭击其他抗议活动
<16-7,CASTLE>He's gonna hit another protest.

247
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,110
<16-8,GATES>联调局已经封锁这条消息了
<16-8,GATES>The FBI is keeping this one under wraps,

248
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,340
<16-8,GATES>但是现在情况紧急
<16-8,GATES>but the clock is still ticking here.

249
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,790
<16-8,GATES>而且你们现在却告诉我
<16-8,GATES>And what you're telling me

250
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,550
<16-8,GATES>从炸弹爆炸到现在
<16-8,GATES>is that we're no closer to getting this guy

251
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,050
<16-8,GATES>我们在缉凶方面毫无进展
<16-8,GATES>than we were when the bomb went off?

252
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,480
<16-9,BECKETT>长官  这些人中有人目睹了
<16-9,BECKETT>Sir, somebody on this list saw exactly what happened

253
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,150
<16-9,BECKETT>那47秒内发生的一切
<16-9,BECKETT>within that 47-second window.

254
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,680
<16-9,BECKETT>但问题是  他们是混在
<16-9,BECKETT>But the problem is, is that they're mixed in

255
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,070
<16-9,BECKETT>那些什么都没看见的人中间
<16-9,BECKETT>with all of these people that saw absolutely nothing.

256
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,140
<16-10,CASTLE>这就像针海捞针一样
<16-10,CASTLE>It's like trying to find Waldo in a sea of Waldos.

257
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,270
<16-11,GATES>这么说你有解决这一问题的提议
<16-11,GATES>I take it you have a proposal to fix that.

258
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,520
<16-12,BECKETT>如果联调局能让我们看广场当时所有的录像带
<16-12,BECKETT>If the FBI would let us view all video shot in the plaza,

259
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,870
<16-12,BECKETT>或许我们就能发现谁离爆炸点最近
<16-12,BECKETT>then maybe we can figure out who was closest to the bomb,

260
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,570
<16-12,BECKETT>就能制定合理的盘问顺序
<16-12,BECKETT>start prioritizing the interviews.

261
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,670
<16-13,GATES>好的  我尽力去拿到录像带
<16-13,GATES>Okay, I'll go down there, do my best.

262
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,430
<16-13,GATES>如果那不管用  我们就得另寻他法
<16-13,GATES>And if that doesn't work, we'll look to plan "B."

263
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,640
<16-13,GATES>与此同时  继续按名单盘问
<16-13,GATES>In the meantime, keep working on the list.

264
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,700
<16-14,BECKETT>她似乎没多少把握能拿到录像带
<16-14,BECKETT>She doesn't seem very optimistic about getting that footage.

265
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,840
<16-15,CASTLE>要知道  离爆炸最近的目击者
<16-15,CASTLE>You know, the witnesses that were closest to the bomb

266
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,380
<16-15,CASTLE>不在我们的名单上
<16-15,CASTLE>aren't on our list.

267
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,260
<16-15,CASTLE>或许死人确实能说话
<16-15,CASTLE>Maybe dead men do tell tales.

268
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,410
<17-1,LANIE PARISH>我刚刚在接待室看到一名记者
<17-1,LANIE PARISH>I just saw a reporter in reception.

269
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,090
<17-1,LANIE PARISH>让保安请他出去了
<17-1,LANIE PARISH>Have security get him outta here.

270
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,650
<17-1,LANIE PARISH>我不想让他打扰死者的家人
<17-1,LANIE PARISH>I don't want him bothering the victims' families.

271
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,340
<17-2,LANIE>看到亲切的面孔太好了
<17-2,LANIE>Oh! So nice to see a friendly face.

272
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,020
<17-2,LANIE>整晚都在跟联调局的人打交道
<17-2,LANIE>FBI has been up in mine all night.

273
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,740
<17-3,CASTLE>这些都是爆炸案的被害人吗
<17-3,CASTLE>All from the explosion?

274
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,230
<17-4,LANIE>他们毫无生还的希望
<17-4,LANIE>They never had a chance.

275
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,900
<17-4,LANIE>你如果想知道正式的死亡原因
<17-4,LANIE>If you're looking for official cause of death,

276
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,550
<17-4,LANIE>都是多重钝器创伤
<17-4,LANIE>it's multiple blunt force trauma.

277
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,590
<17-5,BECKETT>其实我们想问  尸体上是否有什么线索
<17-5,BECKETT>Actually, we were wondering if there's anything on the bodies

278
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,560
<17-5,BECKETT>能帮我们抓到凶手
<17-5,BECKETT>that might lead us to whoever did this.

279
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,470
<17-5,BECKETT>有可能吧
<17-5,BECKETT>Possibly.

280
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,980
<17-6,LANIE>这位是杰西·弗里德曼
<17-6,LANIE>Meet Jesse Friedman.

281
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,040
<17-7,CASTLE>他负责为占领活动招纳抗议者
<17-7,CASTLE>He was the recruiter for the takeover movement.

282
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,330
<17-8,LANIE>他也是离爆炸最近的一个人
<17-8,LANIE>He was also the guy closest to the blast.

283
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,370
<17-8,LANIE>我们发现很多这种东西嵌在他的皮肤里
<17-8,LANIE>And we found bits of this embedded all over his skin.

284
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,640
<17-10,LANIE>-蓝色纤维  -实验室鉴定为帆布
<17-10,LANIE>- Blue fabric? - The lab I.D.'ed it as canvas.

285
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,040
<17-10,LANIE>他们还在上面检测到高浓度的爆炸残留物
<17-10,LANIE>They also found high concentrations of explosive residue on it.

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,410
<17-11,BECKETT>帆布是装炸弹的装置上的一部分
<17-11,BECKETT>The canvas was part of whatever contained the bomb.

287
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,350
<17-12,LANIE>看起来是这样
<17-12,LANIE>Looks that way.

288
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,740
<17-13,CASTLE>那就是粗呢包或者手提箱
<17-13,CASTLE>So a duffel or a suitcase.

289
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,820
<17-14,BECKETT>这真是很大的突破
<17-14,BECKETT>This is a huge break.

290
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,320
<17-14,BECKETT>这意味着凶手是拿蓝包的人
<17-14,BECKETT>That means we're looking for someone carrying a blue bag.

291
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,530
<17-15,BECKETT>我们去向盖茨警监汇报下进展
<17-15,BECKETT>Let's go update Captain Gates.

292
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,460
<17-16,CASTLE>你能等我一下吗
<17-16,CASTLE>Uh, can you just give me a minute?

293
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,980
<17-17,BECKETT>当然可以
<17-17,BECKETT>Yeah, sure.

294
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,690
<18-1,CASTLE>宝贝  你还好吗
<18-1,CASTLE>Hey, honey. How you doing?

295
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,410
<18-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>我没事  我想休息一下
<18-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>Yeah, I just needed a minute.

296
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,620
<18-3,CASTLE>你看起来很累
<18-3,CASTLE>You look exhausted.

297
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,990
<18-3,CASTLE>你在这儿待多久了
<18-3,CASTLE>How long you been here?

298
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,520
<18-4,ALEXIS>我记不住了  这太乱了
<18-4,ALEXIS>I'm not sure. It's been so crazy.

299
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,150
<18-4,ALEXIS>我一直在编录死者的私人物品
<18-4,ALEXIS>I've been cataloging the victims' personal effects.

300
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,440
<18-5,CASTLE>这让你很难过吧
<18-5,CASTLE>Well, that can't be easy.

301
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,210
<18-6,ALEXIS>我一开始没事
<18-6,ALEXIS>I was fine.

302
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,120
<18-6,ALEXIS>直到我看见有个人带着一个手镯
<18-6,ALEXIS>Then I saw how one of them had on this bracelet--

303
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,840
<18-6,ALEXIS>就是小孩用玻璃珠串成的那种
<18-6,ALEXIS>a string with beads made by a little kid--

304
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,740
<18-6,ALEXIS>就像我6岁时  父亲节那天
<18-6,ALEXIS>and it--it was like that bracelet I made you

305
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,850
<18-6,ALEXIS>给你做的那个手镯
<18-6,ALEXIS>for father's day when I was 6.

306
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,710
<18-6,ALEXIS>还记得吗
<18-6,ALEXIS>Do you remember?

307
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,450
<18-7,CASTLE>何止记得  我还留着呢
<18-7,CASTLE>Remember? I still have it.

308
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,230
<18-8,CASTLE>走吧  我送你回家
<18-8,CASTLE>Come on. Let's get you home.

309
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,350
<18-9,ALEXIS>不  我还不能走  我还有工作要做
<18-9,ALEXIS>No, I should stay. There's still work to do.

310
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,490
<18-10,CASTLE>明天干也行
<18-10,CASTLE>And it'll be here tomorrow.

311
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,390
<18-11,ALEXIS>帕里什医生说必须赶在她...
<18-11,ALEXIS>Dr. Parish said I had to get all this finished before she--

312
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,360
<18-12,CASTLE>蕾妮也会让你走的
<18-12,CASTLE>Lanie will tell you the same thing.

313
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,820
<18-13,CASTLE>快走吧
<18-13,CASTLE>Let's get you outta here.

314
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,610
<18-13,CASTLE>占领华尔街
<18-13,CASTLE>Takeover Wall Street.

315
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,760
<19-1,MARK>-好了  我们开拍吧  -收到
<19-1,MARK>- All right. Let's roll this puppy. - Roger that.

316
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
<19-3,NEWCASTER>这是本台记者琳安·韦斯特
<19-3,NEWCASTER>That was our very own Leann West,

317
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,850
<19-3,NEWCASTER>昨天正准备从博亦伦广场发来实况报道
<19-3,NEWCASTER>about to report live from Boylan Plaza yesterday.

318
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,090
<19-3,NEWCASTER>几秒过后  惨剧就发生了
<19-3,NEWCASTER>Moments later, tragedy struck.

319
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,440
<19-3,NEWCASTER>请注意  我们即将播出的部分画面
<19-3,NEWCASTER>Be aware, some of the images we're about to show you

320
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,590
<19-3,NEWCASTER>可能会令人不安
<19-3,NEWCASTER>may be disturbing to some viewers.

321
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,980
<19-4,LEANN>不仅在此  全国各地都有数百人聚集
<19-4,LEANN>Hundreds have gathered here and in other cities across the country

322
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,560
<19-4,LEANN>抗议他们所谓的贪婪和腐败
<19-4,LEANN>to take a stand against what they say is greed and corruption--

323
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,650
<19-4,LEANN>我的天啊
<19-4,LEANN>Oh, my god.

324
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,040
<19-5,NEWSCASTER>到目前为止  本次爆炸案尚无嫌疑对象
<19-5,NEWSCASTER>So far no suspects have been named in the bombing.

325
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,510
<19-6,CASTLE>谢谢
<19-6,CASTLE>Thank you.

326
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,530
<19-6,CASTLE>不客气
<19-6,CASTLE>You're welcome.

327
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,140
<19-7,MARTHA RODGERS>我的...
<19-7,MARTHA RODGERS>How's our...

328
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,270
<19-7,MARTHA RODGERS>我的孙女怎么样
<19-7,MARTHA RODGERS>How's our girl doing?

329
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,080
<19-8,CASTLE>她在楼上睡觉呢
<19-8,CASTLE>She's upstairs in bed, asleep.

330
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,480
<19-8,CASTLE>我希望她能一直这么待着
<19-8,CASTLE>I wish I could keep her in there.

331
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,040
<19-9,MARTHA>亲爱的  你有没有想过
<19-9,MARTHA>Honey, do you ever wonder

332
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,970
<19-9,MARTHA>为什么你去分局工作的第一年
<19-9,MARTHA>why I never visited you at the precinct

333
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,020
<19-9,MARTHA>我从没去看过你
<19-9,MARTHA>the first year you were working there?

334
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,380
<19-10,CASTLE>我一直以为是因为那里灯光太闪眼
<19-10,CASTLE>I always thought it was because of the harsh lighting.

335
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,210
<19-10,CASTLE>那也算一个因素
<19-10,CASTLE>Well, that was a consideration.

336
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,680
<19-11,MARTHA>不  我之前觉得如果我看到你
<19-11,MARTHA>No, I thought if I-- if I saw you

337
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,770
<19-11,MARTHA>执行公务
<19-11,MARTHA>acting like a cop,

338
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,890
<19-11,MARTHA>我就会开始把你当警察看
<19-11,MARTHA>I'd start thinking of you as a cop,

339
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,600
<19-11,MARTHA>那我就...
<19-11,MARTHA>and I just...

340
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,060
<19-11,MARTHA>那我就会做各种噩梦
<19-11,MARTHA>that--that brought on all manner of nightmares.

341
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,760
<19-12,CASTLE>你是怎么克服的
<19-12,CASTLE>How did you get over it?

342
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,170
<19-13,MARTHA>最后  你意识到
<19-13,MARTHA>Eventually, you realize,

343
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,140
<19-13,MARTHA>你的孩子们会做你不喜欢的决定
<19-13,MARTHA>your children are gonna make choices you don't like.

344
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,680
<19-13,MARTHA>这是无法改变的事实
<19-13,MARTHA>Just a fact of life.

345
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,730
<19-14,CASTLE>如果说这次爆炸证明了什么
<19-14,CASTLE>Well, if the bombing proves anything,

346
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,110
<19-14,CASTLE>那就是不管你做什么  不幸都可能发生
<19-14,CASTLE>it's that bad things can happen no matter what you do.

347
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,800
<19-14,CASTLE>天有不测风云
<19-14,CASTLE>Nobody's tomorrow is guaranteed.

348
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,880
<19-15,MARTHA>那...你觉悟后有什么实际打算呢
<19-15,MARTHA>So... How do you plan to act on this realization?

349
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,040
<19-16,CASTLE>-什么意思  -你明白我的意思
<19-16,CASTLE>- What do you mean? - Oh, you know what I mean.

350
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,700
<19-17,MARTHA>理查德  你还想再拖多久
<19-17,MARTHA>Richard, how much longer are you gonna drag your heels

351
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,620
<19-17,MARTHA>才肯向贝克特表白
<19-17,MARTHA>before you tell Beckett how you feel?

352
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,110
<19-17,MARTHA>而且我的意思是趁她还清醒  而不是在胸部中枪
<19-17,MARTHA>And I mean while she is awake, not lying on the ground

353
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,430
<19-17,MARTHA>躺在地上的时候
<19-17,MARTHA>with a bullet in her chest.

354
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,370
<19-18,CASTLE>你不明白
<19-18,CASTLE>You don't understand--

355
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,960
<19-19,MARTHA>我知道你会说情况复杂
<19-19,MARTHA>It's complicated, so you say.

356
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,870
<19-19,MARTHA>可完全相反
<19-19,MARTHA>Only it's not.

357
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,950
<19-19,MARTHA>其实很简单
<19-19,MARTHA>It's not.

358
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,850
<19-19,MARTHA>天有不测风云  是吧
<19-19,MARTHA>Nobody's tomorrows are guaranteed, right?

359
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,680
<19-19,MARTHA>你为什么不去表白呢
<19-19,MARTHA>Wouldn't it be better to tell her

360
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,100
<19-19,MARTHA>即便时机不对
<19-19,MARTHA>even if the timing is wrong

361
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,250
<19-19,MARTHA>也好过永远没机会说出口
<19-19,MARTHA>than never to tell her at all?

362
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,900
<19-20,CASTLE>那如果她没准备好呢
<19-20,CASTLE>And what if she isn't ready?

363
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,710
<19-21,MARTHA>那她就永远不会给你机会了
<19-21,MARTHA>Then she never will be.

364
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,110
<19-21,MARTHA>那你就该释怀了
<19-21,MARTHA>Then you move on.

365
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,660
<20-2,BECKETT>谢了
<20-2,BECKETT>Hey. Thanks.

366
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,550
<20-3,CASTLE>没事  有空吗
<20-3,CASTLE>Yeah. You got a sec?

367
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,730
<20-4,BECKETT>有  什么事
<20-4,BECKETT>Yeah. What's up?

368
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,010
<20-5,CASTLE>我一直想
<20-5,CASTLE>I've been thinking...

369
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,330
<20-5,CASTLE>这些被害人们  还有...
<20-5,CASTLE>about the victims and...

370
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,070
<20-5,CASTLE>他们永远失去了的机会...
<20-5,CASTLE>all the opportunities they'll never have...

371
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,420
<20-5,CASTLE>而我不想也错过机会
<20-5,CASTLE>and I don't want that to happen.

372
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,540
<20-6,CASTLE>我一直...
<20-6,CASTLE>I've been...

374
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,820
<20-7,RYAN>有线索
<20-7,RYAN>We got something.

375
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,920
<20-7,RYAN>没事  可以等到结案后再说
<20-7,RYAN>It's okay. It can wait till after the case.

376
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,680
<21-1,BECKETT>拿到广场的录像了吗
<21-1,BECKETT>Did you get the video from the plaza?

377
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,840
<21-2,GATES>还没  不过我掌握的线索更有用
<21-2,GATES>Not yet, but what I have here is even better.

378
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,220
<21-2,GATES>无线运营商的数据
<21-2,GATES>Data from wireless carriers

379
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,050
<21-2,GATES>显示了博亦伦广场上所有启动了GPS的手机
<21-2,GATES>that shows us all the GPS-activated cell phones in Boylan Plaza.

380
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,690
<21-3,RYAN>这是昨天下午4点32分广场的情况
<21-3,RYAN>This is the plaza yesterday at 4:32,

381
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,640
<21-3,RYAN>就在爆炸发生前
<21-3,RYAN>right before the explosion.

382
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,070
<21-3,RYAN>每个红点代表的是一部特定手机GPS位置
<21-3,RYAN>Each red dot represents the GPS position of a specific phone.

383
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,510
<21-4,BECKETT>你怎么拿到的
<21-4,BECKETT>How did you get this?

384
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,210
<21-5,GATES>我找了国土安全局的一个朋友帮忙要来的
<21-5,GATES>I called in a favor from a friend at Homeland Security.

385
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,860
<21-6,CASTLE>真是个好朋友
<21-6,CASTLE>That is a damn good friend.

386
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,720
<21-7,BECKETT>那如果那些红点代表的是手机
<21-7,BECKETT>So then if those red dots represent cell phones,

387
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,260
<21-7,BECKETT>那我们能查出机主吗
<21-7,BECKETT>can we figure out who they belong to?

388
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,420
<21-8,GATES>就是这个目的
<21-8,GATES>That's the whole idea.

389
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,170
<21-9,BECKETT>如果这图显示了离炸弹最近的人
<21-9,BECKETT>If this shows us who was closest to the bomb,

390
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,520
<21-9,BECKETT>就能确定目击证人了
<21-9,BECKETT>it gives us our witnesses.

391
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,040
<21-10,GATES>还能显示每个人的实时地点
<21-10,GATES>It can even show us where everyone was in real time.

392
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,100
<21-10,GATES>快进到4点32分
<21-10,GATES>Advance it to 4:32.

393
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,530
<21-10,GATES>你试了整整11件婚纱
<21-10,GATES>I mean, you tried on 11 dresses.

394
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,260
<21-11,BECKETT>他们所谓的贪婪和腐败...
<21-11,BECKETT>what they say is greed and corruption--

395
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,410
<21-11,BECKETT>那些点消失了
<21-11,BECKETT>the dots that disappeared,

396
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,510
<21-11,BECKETT>那是爆炸发生的时间
<21-11,BECKETT>That's the explosion.

397
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,730
<21-12,CASTLE>等等  你们看到了吗
<21-12,CASTLE>Wait a second. You guys see that?

398
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,960
<21-12,CASTLE>就在...
<21-12,CASTLE>There was--

399
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,720
<21-12,CASTLE>爆炸发生前
<21-12,CASTLE>right before the bomb went off.

400
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,820
<21-12,CASTLE>莱恩  能倒退十秒吗
<21-12,CASTLE>Ryan, could you take it back ten seconds?

401
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,840
<21-13,CASTLE>看那个点
<21-13,CASTLE>That dot right there.

402
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,700
<21-13,CASTLE>就在爆炸发生前
<21-13,CASTLE>Right before the explosion,

403
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,300
<21-13,CASTLE>它跑去了爆炸发生点
<21-13,CASTLE>it goes to the blast site,

404
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,890
<21-13,CASTLE>逗留了一秒
<21-13,CASTLE>waits for a second,

405
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,710
<21-13,CASTLE>然后迅速跑开了
<21-13,CASTLE>and then rushes away.

406
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,080
<21-14,GATES>重放一遍
<21-14,GATES>Play it again.

407
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,010
<21-14,GATES>你试了整整11件婚纱
<21-14,GATES>I mean, you tried on 11 dresses.

408
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,370
<21-15,BECKETT>那是炸弹客
<21-15,BECKETT>That's the bomber.

409
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,030
<21-16,RYAN>我把他的身份信息调出来
<21-16,RYAN>So I'm gonna to pull up his I.D.

410
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,550
<21-17,RYAN>手机登记在安德鲁·海耶斯名下
<21-17,RYAN>Cell phone's registered to an Andrew Haynes.

411
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,370
<21-18,GATES>告诉我他现在的所在地
<21-18,GATES>Tell me where he is right now.

412
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,960
<21-19,RYAN>没有GPS信号
<21-19,RYAN>No GPS signal.

413
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,520
<21-19,RYAN>要么是电池没电  要么是关机了
<21-19,RYAN>Uh, his battery's either dead or his phone is off.

414
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,480
<21-20,BECKETT>等等  海耶斯这名字很耳熟
<21-20,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Haynes sounds familiar.

415
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,100
<21-20,BECKETT>他二十分钟前刚来分局做笔录
<21-20,BECKETT>He showed up in the precinct 20 minutes ago for an interview.

416
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,330
<21-21,CASTLE>炸弹客在楼里
<21-21,CASTLE>The bomber's in the building?

417
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,590
<22-1,RYAN>警员对他进行了全身搜查
<22-1,RYAN>Unis gave him a full body.

418
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,910
<22-1,RYAN>没武器  没爆炸物
<22-1,RYAN>No weapons. No explosives.

419
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,700
<22-2,BECKETT>他还以为他是作为目击者来接受问询吗
<22-2,BECKETT>He still thinks he's here as a witness?

420
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,510
<22-3,ESPOSITO>我们告诉他搜身是例行公事
<22-3,ESPOSITO>We told him the search was routine.

421
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,380
<22-4,CASTLE>这就是安德鲁·海耶斯
<22-4,CASTLE>So this is Andrew Haynes.

422
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,590
<22-4,CASTLE>他什么背景
<22-4,CASTLE>What's his story?

423
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,430
<22-5,ESPOSITO>他反对占领活动
<22-5,ESPOSITO>He has it out for the takeover Movement.

424
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,040
<22-5,ESPOSITO>他组织过反示威
<22-5,ESPOSITO>He's organized counterdemonstrations,

425
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,600
<22-5,ESPOSITO>破坏他们的集会  还发过传单
<22-5,ESPOSITO>disrupted their rallies, he's even handed out fliers

426
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,640
<22-5,ESPOSITO>说应采取任何必要手段阻止那些抗议者
<22-5,ESPOSITO>saying how they should be stopped by any means necessary.

427
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,820
<22-6,RYAN>他还付诸了行动  他还是几年前
<22-6,RYAN>He walks the walk, too. He was a suspect in the bombing

428
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,690
<22-6,RYAN>一些绿色和平组织办事处爆炸案的疑犯
<22-6,RYAN>of some Greenpeace offices a few years back.

429
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,850
<22-7,BECKETT>他的住处有发现吗
<22-7,BECKETT>Anything turn up at his place?

430
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,580
<22-8,RYAN>有  证据确凿
<22-8,RYAN>Yeah, a smoking gun.

431
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,140
<22-8,RYAN>警员发现了他常去的网络咖啡屋的收据
<22-8,RYAN>Unis found receipts to an internet cafe where he goes.

432
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,520
<22-8,RYAN>他们追踪那些恐吓邮件
<22-8,RYAN>Now they traced those e-mail threats

433
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,700
<22-8,RYAN>查到了那间咖啡馆和海耶斯的登陆账号
<22-8,RYAN>back to that cafe and Haynes log-in I.D.

434
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,420
<22-8,RYAN>他就是我们要找的人
<22-8,RYAN>He's our guy.

435
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,410
<22-9,BECKETT>那他为什么还能在这里走来走去  镇定自若
<22-9,BECKETT>So then why is he strolling in here just as cool as could be?

436
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,570
<22-10,CASTLE>我猜  他对他的所作所为很自豪
<22-10,CASTLE>My guess-- he's proud of what he's done,

437
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,740
<22-10,CASTLE>迫不及待要告诉别人
<22-10,CASTLE>can't wait to tell someone about it.

438
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,210
<22-11,BECKETT>那我们就给他机会  让他如愿以偿
<22-11,BECKETT>Well, then let's give him the opportunity to do just that.

439
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,960
<23-1,BECKETT>你好  海耶斯先生
<23-1,BECKETT>Hi, Mr. Haynes.

<23-2,ANDREW HAYNES>It's about time you brought me in here.

443
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,750
<23-2,ANDREW HAYNES>要是让我跟那些唧唧歪歪的麻烦精挤在一起
<23-2,ANDREW HAYNES>If I had to rub elbows with those whiny little troublemakers...

444
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,690
<23-2,ANDREW HAYNES>我可能要动粗了
<23-2,ANDREW HAYNES>I was gonna do something drastic.

445
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,660
<23-3,BECKETT>是啊  我可不会怪你
<23-3,BECKETT>Oh, yeah, well, I wouldn't blame you.

446
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,350
<23-4,HAYNES>你思想自由  我深表敬意
<23-4,HAYNES>Hey, free thinker. I respect that.

447
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,310
<23-5,BECKETT>撇开我的个人意见
<23-5,BECKETT>Um, you know, my personal feelings aside,

448
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,940
<23-5,BECKETT>我还是得调查这个案件
<23-5,BECKETT>I still have to investigate this incident.

449
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,610
<23-6,HAYNES>当然  工作时得一丝不苟嘛
<23-6,HAYNES>Yeah, you know, you--you gotta dot your I's, cross your t's.

450
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,180
<23-6,HAYNES>我懂
<23-6,HAYNES>I get that.

451
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,490
<23-7,BECKETT>没错  我得问你几个问题
<23-7,BECKETT>Exactly. So I just have to ask you a few questions

452
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,940
<23-7,BECKETT>关于爆炸发生之前你都看到了什么
<23-7,BECKETT>about what you saw just before the bombing,

453
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,160
<23-7,BECKETT>先说说...
<23-7,BECKETT>starting with...

454
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,260
<23-8,HAYNES>你当时的位置吧
<23-8,HAYNES>where you were.

<23-9,BECKETT>- about 100 feet from the blast site? - Yeah.

459
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,770

<23-12,HAYNES>我就是在跟他们争论
<23-12,HAYNES>Oh, I was, uh, pretty much getting hassled.

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,750
<24-2,HAYNES>-你不爽我说的话吗  -对不起
<24-2,HAYNES>- You don't like what I have to say? - Sorry.

470
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,120
<24-4,HAYNES>没法面对现实吗
<24-4,HAYNES>Huh? Can't face the truth?

471
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,860
<24-4,HAYNES>不好意思  我要问明白
<24-4,HAYNES>I'm sorry. Just--just so I'm clear, so...

472
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,270
<25-1,BECKETT>你爆炸发生前一直在跟抗议者争辩吗
<25-1,BECKETT>you were debating with the protesters until that bomb went off?

473
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,200
<25-2,HAYNES>没错  我想让他们面对现实
<25-2,HAYNES>Yeah, I was trying to give 'em a reality check.

474
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,900
<25-2,HAYNES>他们在那儿竭力抗议什么贪婪的公司
<25-2,HAYNES>I mean, you know, they're all up in arms about the greedy corporation,

475
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,790
<25-2,HAYNES>可也不想想是谁给他们提供的工作
<25-2,HAYNES>and who do they think is creating the jobs?

476
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,810
<25-2,HAYNES>这帮人是吃饱了撑得伪君子罢了
<25-2,HAYNES>You know, they're a bunch of silver-spoon hypocrites.

477
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,360
<25-2,HAYNES>半数人甚至都
<25-2,HAYNES>I mean, half of them, they don't--

478
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,480
<25-2,HAYNES>不知道自己在抗议什么东西
<25-2,HAYNES>they don't even know who they're protesting against.

479
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,420
<25-3,BECKETT>没错  阻止他们其实是给国家造福了
<25-3,BECKETT>Right, and stopping them would actually be a service to this country.

480
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,160
<25-4,HAYNES>对  真心爱国的人都会把这视为当务之急
<25-4,HAYNES>Yeah, it'd be item number one on any true patriot's to-do list.

481
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,050
<25-5,BECKETT>你是一名真正的爱国者  对不对
<25-5,BECKETT>And you are a true patriot, aren't you,

482
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,340
<25-6,HAYNES>-安德鲁  -一点儿没错
<25-6,HAYNES>- Andrew? You're damn right about that.

483
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,930
<25-7,BECKETT>所以为了你爱的国家
<25-7,BECKETT>That's why you put that bomb in the Plaza,

484
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,390
<25-7,BECKETT>你就在广场上放置了那个炸弹
<25-7,BECKETT>to defend the country that you love?

485
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,960
<25-8,HAYNES>你在说什么
<25-8,HAYNES>What are you talking about?

486
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,360
<25-8,HAYNES>得了吧  安德鲁
<25-8,HAYNES>Come on, Andrew.

487
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,360
<25-9,BECKETT>我不想你坐没必要坐的牢
<25-9,BECKETT>I don't want you to have to serve any more time than you have to.

488
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,430
<25-9,BECKETT>你跟那些抗议者意见相左
<25-9,BECKETT>We know that you weren't with those protesters.

489
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,000
<25-9,BECKETT>于是你来到这里  放下炸弹
<25-9,BECKETT>You were down here, dropping off the bomb

490
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,030
<25-10,HAYNES>-然后跑开躲起来  -有什么证据
<25-10,HAYNES>-and then running for cover. -Based on what?

491
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,280
<25-11,BECKETT>我们追查了你的手机
<25-11,BECKETT>We traced your phone.

492
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,260
<25-11,BECKETT>GPS显示你就在那
<25-11,BECKETT>The GPS places you right there.

493
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,540
<25-12,HAYNES>你不能证明那是我  我手机昨天丢了
<25-12,HAYNES>You can't prove it was me. I lost my phone yesterday.

494
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,440
<25-13,BECKETT>是吗
<25-13,BECKETT>Really?

495
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,570
<25-14,HAYNES>好吧  那你给我解释下这个
<25-14,HAYNES>Okay, then maybe you can explain this.

496
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,280
<25-15,BECKETT>你在网络咖啡屋发的恐吓信
<25-15,BECKETT>Threatening e-mails that you sent from an internet cafe,

497
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,470
<25-15,BECKETT>声称抗议活动不停止你就要继续制造爆炸
<25-15,BECKETT>promising to continue those bombings until the protests stopped.

498
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,070
<25-16,HAYNES>我要求跟我的律师谈
<25-16,HAYNES>I'd like to talk to my lawyer.

499
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,260
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>白人男性
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>White male,

500
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,710
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>反社会的不合群者  有极端政治观点
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>antisocial loner, extreme political views--

501
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,800
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>跟行为科学部给我们提供的罪犯特征完全吻合
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>he's a perfect fit for the profile B.S.U. worked up for us.

502
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,540
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>我们会把他带到市里继续审问的
<26-1,AGENT JOHNSON>We'll continue questioning him downtown.

503
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,560
<26-2,GATES>可我的手下说他并不认罪
<26-2,GATES>Well, according to my people, he's nowhere near confessing.

504
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,750
<26-3,AGENT JOHNSON>让他们对目击者进行回访
<26-3,AGENT JOHNSON>Well, have them reinterview the witnesses

505
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,410
<26-3,AGENT JOHNSON>找到目睹了海耶斯把背包放下的目击者
<26-3,AGENT JOHNSON>and find us someone that saw Haynes put that backpack down.

506
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,710
<26-4,GATES>不用谢
<26-4,GATES>You're welcome.

507
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,280
<26-4,GATES>我们根据GPS找到二十名目击海耶斯走过的人
<26-4,GATES>So we talked to 20 witnesses along Haynes' GPS path,

508
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,980
<27-1,ESPOSITO>但没有人能准确地认出他
<27-1,ESPOSITO>but none of them can positively I.D. Him.

509
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,340
<27-2,RYAN>当时太乱  没人能够肯定到底发生了什么
<27-2,RYAN>With all the confusion, no one's exactly sure what happened.

510
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,340
<27-2,RYAN>你们有查到什么没
<27-2,RYAN>You guys have any luck?

511
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,850
<27-3,BECKETT>四个人称看到过一个穿黑色占领活动套头衫的人
<27-3,BECKETT>Four people remember seeing a guy in a black Takeover hoodie,

512
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,440
<27-3,BECKETT>可没人看到他的长相
<27-3,BECKETT>but nobody remembers seeing his face.

513
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,940
<27-4,ESPOSITO>一件黑色套头衫可不足以结案
<27-4,ESPOSITO>A black hoodie doesn't get us home,

514
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,670
<27-4,ESPOSITO>半数抗议者都穿着一样的衣服
<27-4,ESPOSITO>not with half the protesters wearing them.

515
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:24,240
<27-5,RYAN>肯定有人见过这家伙
<27-5,RYAN>Somebody had to have seen this guy.

516
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,190
<27-6,CASTLE>我们还漏掉了一名抗议者
<27-6,CASTLE>There's a protester we haven't spoken to yet--

517
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,460
<27-6,CASTLE>那个街头鼓手
<27-6,CASTLE>The street drummer.

518
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,060
<27-7,CASTLE>摄影师赶走他之后
<27-7,CASTLE>After the cameraman rousted him,

519
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,780
<27-7,CASTLE>那个伴娘说他走到
<27-7,CASTLE>that bridesmaid said he relocated...

520
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,120
<27-7,CASTLE>咖啡摊附近了
<27-7,CASTLE>by the coffee truck,

521
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,530
<27-7,CASTLE>那么他也该看到海耶斯走过
<27-7,CASTLE>which would put him right in Haynes' path.

522
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,310
<27-8,BECKETT>也就是说他有可能看到了海耶斯的脸
<27-8,BECKETT>Which means he could've seen Haynes' face.

523
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,080
<27-9,RYAN>没错  可我们不知道他的名字
<27-9,RYAN>Yeah, but we don't know his name

524
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,940
<27-9,RYAN>他不在目击者名单上
<27-9,RYAN>and he's not on our witness list.

525
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,950
<27-9,RYAN>我们要怎么找到他
<27-9,RYAN>How are we gonna find this guy?

526
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,310
<27-10,BECKETT>他是个街头表演者
<27-10,BECKETT>You know what? He's a street performer.

527
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,520
<27-10,BECKETT>有可能因滋扰行为收到过法院传票
<27-10,BECKETT>He's probably gotten nuisance citations, which means,

528
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,850
<27-10,BECKETT>如果真有  那我们应该就能找到他
<27-10,BECKETT>if he has, we should be able to I.D. Him.

529
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,600
<28-1,MALIK>我是做音乐的  干嘛逮捕我
<28-1,MALIK>I make music. Why do you arrest me?

530
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,240
<28-2,BECKETT>我们不是逮捕你  马利克
<28-2,BECKETT>We're not arresting you, Malik.

531
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,050
<28-2,BECKETT>只不过想问你几个问题而已
<28-2,BECKETT>We just need to ask you a few questions

532
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,470
<28-2,BECKETT>昨天下午你在博亦伦广场都看到了什么
<28-2,BECKETT>about what you saw in Boylan Plaza yesterday afternoon.

533
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,820
<28-3,MALIK>我对爆炸的事一无所知
<28-3,MALIK>I know nothing about the bomb.

534
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,830
<28-3,MALIK>-我是无辜的  -我们相信你
<28-3,MALIK>- I am an innocent man. - And we believe you.

535
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,030
<28-5,BECKETT>但你有可能看到了什么
<28-5,BECKETT>But we think that you might have seen something

536
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,150
<28-5,BECKETT>能够帮我们抓到凶手
<28-5,BECKETT>that'll help us catch the person who did this.

537
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,540
<28-6,MALIK>我  我不想惹麻烦
<28-6,MALIK>I-I don't want trouble.

538
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,290
<28-7,BECKETT>马利克  你的护照是不是过期了
<28-7,BECKETT>Malik, your visa expired, didn't it?

539
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,520
<28-7,BECKETT>所以你才这么焦虑  是吗
<28-7,BECKETT>Is that what's worrying you?

540
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,330
<28-8,MALIK>我不能回自己的国家去
<28-8,MALIK>I cannot go back to my country.

541
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,420
<28-9,BECKETT>我不会把你遣送回去的
<28-9,BECKETT>And I won't make you.

542
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,120
<28-9,BECKETT>我不管你是不是非法滞留
<28-9,BECKETT>I don't care about your immigration status.

543
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,860
<28-9,BECKETT>我们只想知道
<28-9,BECKETT>We just need to know

544
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,340
<28-9,BECKETT>爆炸发生之前你都看到了什么
<28-9,BECKETT>exactly what you saw just before that explosion.

545
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,520
<28-10,MALIK>我会把记得的都告诉你们
<28-10,MALIK>I will tell you what I can.

546
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,950
<28-11,CASTLE>好的
<28-11,CASTLE>Okay.

547
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,470
<29-1,CASTLE>你在咖啡摊旁表演的时候
<29-1,CASTLE>When you were playing by the coffee truck,

548
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,780
<29-1,CASTLE>有个男的穿着占领活动运动衫走过你旁边
<29-1,CASTLE>a man walked by you wearing a black Takeover Sweatshirt.

549
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,640
<29-1,CASTLE>你记得他吗
<29-1,CASTLE>Do you remember seeing him?

550
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,080
<29-2,MALIK>没错  我看到过
<29-2,MALIK>Yes. I saw him.

551
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,200
<29-2,MALIK>等等  你是说
<29-2,MALIK>Wait a minute. Are you saying

552
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,780
<29-2,MALIK>你看到身穿占领活动运动衫的男人
<29-2,MALIK>that you saw the man wearing the Takeover Sweatshirt

553
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,580
<30-1,BECKETT>在街灯前放下了一个蓝色背包吗
<30-1,BECKETT>put down a blue backpack in front of the lamppost?

554
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,850
<30-1,BECKETT>-没错  -你看到他的脸没
<30-1,BECKETT>- Yes. - Did you get a good look at his face?

555
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,320
<30-1,BECKETT>靠
<30-1,BECKETT>Damn it!

556
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,080
<30-2,MALIK>你确定你看到的那个放包的男人
<30-2,MALIK>You're certain the man you saw leaving the backpack

557
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,090
<30-2,MALIK>是二十多岁的西班牙人吗
<30-2,MALIK>was Hispanic and in his 20s?

558
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,290
<30-2,MALIK>确定
<30-2,MALIK>Yes.

559
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,490
<32-3,MALIK>我  我说的不对吗
<32-3,MALIK>I-I gave the wrong answer?

560
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,750
<32-4,BECKETT>你确定不是这个人
<32-4,BECKETT>Are you sure this wasn't the person?

561
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,530
<32-5,MALIK>确定  不是他
<32-5,MALIK>No. That's not him.

562
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,680
<32-6,BECKETT>联调局抓错人了
<32-6,BECKETT>The FBI has got the wrong guy.

563
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,270
<32-7,CASTLE>也就是说真正的炸弹客还逍遥法外
<32-7,CASTLE>Which means the real bomber is still out there.

564
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,290
<32-7,CASTLE>如果炸弹不是安德鲁·海耶斯放的
<32-7,CASTLE>If Andrew Haynes didn't plant the bomb,

565
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,820
<33-1,AGENT JOHNSON>为什么他要发那些恐吓信
<33-1,AGENT JOHNSON>then why did he e-mail those threats?

566
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,160
<33-1,AGENT JOHNSON>为什么GPS显示他逃离了犯罪现场
<33-1,AGENT JOHNSON>Why does his GPS show him fleeing the scene?

567
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,330
<33-2,GATES>目前我们无从得知
<33-2,GATES>We can't answer that yet,

568
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,090
<33-2,GATES>不过目击者给了我们一张精确的画像
<33-2,GATES>but our witness gave a good description.

569
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,080
<33-3,BECKETT>就是这个人
<33-3,BECKETT>It was this man.

570
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,890
<33-4,AGENT JOHNSON>我们怎么知道这人没在瞎编
<33-4,AGENT JOHNSON>How do we know this guy is not making this up?

571
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,230
<33-5,BECKETT>有关爆炸案的详情
<33-5,BECKETT>Look, the details of the bomb

572
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,860
<33-5,BECKETT>还没有公布给媒体
<33-5,BECKETT>haven't been released to the press yet,

573
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,640
<33-5,BECKETT>除非目击者亲眼见到那个蓝色背包
<33-5,BECKETT>so how would our witness know about the blue backpack

574
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,040
<33-5,BECKETT>不然他从何得知
<33-5,BECKETT>unless he actually saw it?

575
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,750
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>好吧  你们就追查这条线索
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>All right, you people pursue this.

576
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,740
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>看看能有什么结果
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>see where it leads.

577
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,940
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>但是安德鲁·海耶斯仍是我们的头号嫌犯
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>But Andrew Haynes is still our prime suspect.

578
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,190
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>至少在你们找到比街头音乐家更
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>At least until you can give me something more

579
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,860
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>可靠的证词之前
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>than the word of a street musician.

580
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,750
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>找到这个人
<33-6,AGENT JOHNSON>Identifying this man,

581
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,160
<34-1,GATES>这是我们现在的首要任务
<34-1,GATES>that is now our top priority.

582
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,300
<34-1,GATES>根据证词
<34-1,GATES>According to our witness,

583
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,960
<34-1,GATES>案发时他身着占领活动运动衫
<34-1,GATES>he was wearing a Takeover Sweatshirt,

584
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
<34-1,GATES>因此他可能是名抗议者
<34-1,GATES>so he might be part of the movement.

585
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,460
<34-1,GATES>把这张素描分发下去  询问其他抗议者
<34-1,GATES>Show this sketch around, talk to other protesters.

586
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,370
<34-1,GATES>如果他是博亦伦广场的常客
<34-1,GATES>If he was a regular in Boylan Plaza,

587
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,580
<34-1,GATES>肯定就会有人认出他
<34-1,GATES>someone there must know who he is.

588
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,020
<34-2,GATES>卡塞尔先生  你就别去了
<34-2,GATES>Uh, not you, Mr. Castle.

00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,760
<34-3,GATES>而且在我认识你的这段时间里
<34-3,GATES>and in the time that I've known you,

592
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,340

<34-3,GATES>on occasion, an exceptional attention to detail.

594
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,810
<34-4,CASTLE>这是你第一次对我大加赞...
<34-4,CASTLE>That's the first time you've ever paid me a complime--

595
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,300
<34-5,CASTLE>继续
<34-5,CASTLE>Go on.

596
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,200
<34-6,GATES>目前我们已进行了上百次的笔录
<34-6,GATES>We've conducted over a hundred interviews so far,

597
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,510
<34-6,GATES>需要有个人快速审阅一遍
<34-6,GATES>And someone needs to review them swiftly,

598
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,310
<34-6,GATES>查找能锁定嫌疑人的线索
<34-6,GATES>looking for information that can help us I.D. Our suspect.

<34-7,CASTLE>我想她终于开始喜欢我了
<34-7,CASTLE>I think she's finally starting to like me.

601
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,020
<34-8,GATES>我可没有
<34-8,GATES>No, I'm not.

602
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,030
<34-9,CASTLE>烦死她
<34-9,CASTLE>Wearing her down.

603
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,540
<35-1,CASTLE>-早上好  -早啊
<35-1,CASTLE>-Good morning. -Morning.

<35-2,ALEXIS>案子有什么进展吗
<35-2,ALEXIS>Any breaks in the case?

605
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,720
<35-3,CASTLE>没有  我在研究这些目击者证词
<35-3,CASTLE>No. I've been poring over these witness statements

606
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,330
<35-3,CASTLE>查找炸弹客的线索
<35-3,CASTLE>looking for clues about our bomber,

607
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,810
<35-3,CASTLE>但是目前为止  一无所获
<35-3,CASTLE>but so far, nothing.

608
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,570
<35-4,ALEXIS>也许吃点这个会带给你好运
<35-4,ALEXIS>Well, maybe these will bring you some luck.

609
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,020
<35-5,CASTLE>这是突发事件的庆祝煎饼
<35-5,CASTLE>These are emergency cheering-up pancakes.

610
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,660
<35-5,CASTLE>我是说  通常都是为闹僵之后
<35-5,CASTLE>I mean, these are usually reserved for after breakups

611
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,560
<35-5,CASTLE>或是《与星共舞》的淘汰赛准备的
<35-5,CASTLE>or "Dancing With the Stars" eliminations.

<35-6,ALEXIS>我想我们俩都需要打起精神
<35-6,ALEXIS>I thought we both needed some cheering up.

614
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,830
<35-7,CASTLE>你本不需要打起精神
<35-7,CASTLE>You shouldn't need cheering up.

615
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,570
<35-7,CASTLE>你就不该在那儿
<35-7,CASTLE>You shouldn't have even been there.

616
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,530
<35-7,CASTLE>你本该跟朋友待在一起  或是看电影
<35-7,CASTLE>You should've been with your friends or at the movies.

617
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,790

00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,720
<40-15,BECKETT>好了好了  你记得炸弹爆炸后
<40-15,BECKETT>Oh, okay, okay, so remember what happened

693
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,950
<40-15,BECKETT>发生的事  之前的却忘了
<40-15,BECKETT>after the bomb went off, but not before.

694
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,710
<40-16,BOBBY>我一定是得了创伤后失忆症之类的
<40-16,BOBBY>It must have been one of those traumatic amnesia things.

695
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,910
<40-17,BECKETT>鲍比  别跟我撒谎
<40-17,BECKETT>Bobby... Don't lie to me.

696
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,130
<40-18,BOBBY>我是在告诉你  当时一片空白
<40-18,BOBBY>I'm telling you, it was all a big blank.

697
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,800
<40-18,BOBBY>是因为创伤所致
<40-18,BOBBY>It was the trauma.

698
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,950
<40-19,BECKETT>跟创伤无关
<40-19,BECKETT>It was not the trauma.

699
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,560
<40-19,BECKETT>你不准那个借口
<40-19,BECKETT>You don't get to use that excuse.

700
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,050
<40-20,BOBBY>我发誓  我不记得了
<40-20,BOBBY>I swear, I don't remember.

701
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,800
<40-21,BECKETT>去你的不记得了
<40-21,BECKETT>The hell you don't remember.

702
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,960
<40-21,BECKETT>你想了解创伤吗
<40-21,BECKETT>Do you want to know trauma?

703
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,630
<40-21,BECKETT>我胸部中过枪  而事情经过的分分秒秒
<40-21,BECKETT>I was shot in the chest and I remember

704
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,480
<40-21,BECKETT>我都记得
<40-21,BECKETT>every second of it.

705
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,360
<40-22,BECKETT>所以你也会记得
<40-22,BECKETT>And so do you.

706
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,590
<40-23,CASTLE>这么久以来
<40-23,CASTLE>All this time...

707
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,460
<40-23,CASTLE>你都记得
<40-23,CASTLE>you remembered?

708
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,320
<41-1,ESPOSITO>那家伙还是没招
<41-1,ESPOSITO>Guy's still not talking?

709
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,670
<41-2,BECKETT>还没  我让他一个人出出冷汗
<41-2,BECKETT>Not yet. I'm gonna let him sweat for a bit.

710
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,870
<41-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔来了吗
<41-2,BECKETT>Was Castle here?

711
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,250
<41-3,ESPOSITO>对  来了
<41-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, earlier.

712
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,680
<41-3,ESPOSITO>但又说得走了
<41-3,ESPOSITO>But he said he had to go.

713
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,960
<41-3,ESPOSITO>说要去个地方
<41-3,ESPOSITO>Said there was somewhere he needed to be.

714
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,690
<42-1,MARTHA>理查德  搞什么
<42-1,MARTHA>Oh, Richard...really?

715
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,420
<42-1,MARTHA>炸弹事件追悼会
<42-1,MARTHA>A bomb memorial?

716
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,060
<42-1,MARTHA>拜托  宝贝  这不是有点变态啊
<42-1,MARTHA>Come on, honey. Isn't this kind of morbid?

717
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,160
<42-2,CASTLE>这正是我现在的感受
<42-2,CASTLE>Well, it's how I'm feeling.

718
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,740
<42-3,MARTHA>她又没死
<42-3,MARTHA>She isn't dead.

719
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,130
<42-4,CASTLE>她倒不如死了
<42-4,CASTLE>She might as well be.

720
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,490
<42-5,CASTLE>我真以为我们能一起有未来
<42-5,CASTLE>I really thought we could have a future together.

721
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,120
<42-5,CASTLE>我愿意等她
<42-5,CASTLE>You know, I was-- I was willing to wait.

722
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,690
<40-18,BOBBY>结果发现一切不过是天大的玩笑
<40-18,BOBBY>Come to find out it was just a big joke.

723
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,760
<42-4,CASTLE>她都知道
<42-4,CASTLE>She knew.

724
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,340
<42-5,CASTLE>都这么久了  她都记得
<42-5,CASTLE>This whole time, she remembered,

725
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,970
<42-5,CASTLE>而她一字不提
<42-5,CASTLE>and she didn't say anything...

726
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,890
<42-5,CASTLE>因为她很尴尬
<42-5,CASTLE>Because she was embarrassed

727
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,830
<42-5,CASTLE>因为她不爱我
<42-5,CASTLE>Because she doesn't feel the same way.

728
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,790
<42-5,CASTLE>我真蠢
<42-5,CASTLE>I'm such a fool.

729
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,530
<42-6,MARTHA>好了  我们回家吧
<42-6,MARTHA>Well, come on. Let's go home.

730
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,260
<42-6,MARTHA>开瓶好酒
<42-6,MARTHA>Break out some of the good stuff, okay?

731
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,170
<42-7,CASTLE>我倒是想  我得回去
<42-7,CASTLE>Oh, I'd love to. I gotta be getting back.

732
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:50,460
<42-7,CASTLE>回去
<42-7,CASTLE>Back?

733
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,750
<42-8,MARTHA>你明知她心里的想法  明知她喜欢过你
<42-8,MARTHA>Why on earth would you go back

734
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,460
<42-8,MARTHA>你究竟为什么回去
<42-8,MARTHA>knowing how she feels, knowing that she liked you--

735
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,970
<42-9,CASTLE>不是为了她  这是...
<42-9,CASTLE>This isn't about her. This is...

736
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,800
<42-9,CASTLE>这是为了他们
<42-9,CASTLE>This is about them.

737
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,790
<42-9,CASTLE>这是为了做实事
<42-9,CASTLE>You know it's about doing something real...

738
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,950
<42-9,CASTLE>重要的事
<42-9,CASTLE>something that matters.

739
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,800
<42-9,CASTLE>我不愿意放弃
<42-9,CASTLE>I'm not willing to let that go.

740
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,230
<42-10,MARTHA>理查德  爱情不是开关
<42-10,MARTHA>Richard, love is not a switch.

741
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,600
<42-10,MARTHA>你没法说关就关
<42-10,MARTHA>You can't just turn it off.

742
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,260
<42-10,MARTHA>你不可能和她并肩工作而不心动
<42-10,MARTHA>You can't work side by side with her and not feel anything.

743
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,690
<42-11,CASTLE>看我的吧
<42-11,CASTLE>Watch me.

744
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,040
<43-2,BECKETT>你刚才去哪儿了
<43-2,BECKETT>Hey. Where were you?

745
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,250
<43-3,CASTLE>就是去清醒一下  对鲍比的调查进展如何
<43-3,CASTLE>Just clearing my head. Where are we on Bobby?

746
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,250
<43-4,BECKETT>警员们正在搜查他的住所
<43-4,BECKETT>Uniforms are searching his place.

747
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,460
<43-4,BECKETT>我们希望能找到些证据  让他松口
<43-4,BECKETT>We're hoping to find something that'll break him.

748
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,290
<43-5,ESPOSITO>联调局打电话来提供了跟进情况
<43-5,ESPOSITO>FBI called with an update.

749
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,370
<43-5,ESPOSITO>博亦伦广场引爆的炸弹
<43-5,ESPOSITO>The device used in Boylan Plaza

750
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,570
<43-5,ESPOSITO>是管状炸药  蹊跷之处在于
<43-5,ESPOSITO>was a pipe bomb, here's the weird part,

751
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,980
<43-5,ESPOSITO>它没有加置钉子等任何东西
<43-5,ESPOSITO>it wasn't packed with nails or anything else

752
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,150
<43-6,BECKETT>的确很蹊跷  凶手一般会加置发射物
<43-6,BECKETT>That is weird, bombers usually add projectiles

753
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,060
<43-7,CASTLE>以提高杀伤力
<43-7,CASTLE>to maximize damage.

754
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,490
<43-7,CASTLE>那可不是提高杀伤力的唯一方法
<43-7,CASTLE>That's not the only way to maximize damage.

755
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,180
<43-8,BECKETT>它是由什么引爆的
<43-8,BECKETT>So what was it triggered by,

756
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,530
<43-8,BECKETT>手机引爆还是触发式
<43-8,BECKETT>cell phone, trip wire?

757
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,590
<43-9,ESPOSITO>是远程控制  可能是用车库门遥控开关改装的
<43-9,ESPOSITO>A remote, probably rigged from a garage door opener.

758
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,420
<43-9,ESPOSITO>但控制范围只有大约30米
<43-9,ESPOSITO>But the range of those was only about 100 feet

759
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,000
<43-10,CASTLE>所以引爆炸药的人当时一定身处博亦伦广场
<43-10,CASTLE>So whoever detonated it was in Boylan Plaza.

760
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,860
<43-11,BECKETT>我打赌你能在鲍比的住所内
<43-11,BECKETT>And I bet you will find that garage remote

761
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,880
<43-11,BECKETT>找到那个车库门遥控器
<43-11,BECKETT>in Bobby's apartment.

762
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,980
<43-12,RYAN>没那么好的运气
<43-12,RYAN>Uh, no such luck. But...

763
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,360
<43-12,RYAN>不过我们找到一堆信用卡
<43-12,RYAN>we did find credit cards

764
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,350
<43-12,RYAN>上面写着许多不同人的姓名
<43-12,RYAN>with lots of different names on them.

765
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,270
<43-12,RYAN>我们还找到一些钱包
<43-12,RYAN>And we found some wallets

766
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,840
<43-12,RYAN>和几部手机
<43-12,RYAN>and some cell phones, too.

767
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,070
<43-12,RYAN>而且  其中一部手机
<43-12,RYAN>In fact, one of those cell phones

768
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,040
<43-12,RYAN>是属于安德鲁·海耶斯的
<43-12,RYAN>belonged to Andrew Haynes.

769
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,020
<43-13,BECKETT>鲍比是名扒手
<43-13,BECKETT>Bobby's a pickpocket.

770
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,110
<44-1,BOBBY>是的  你可以这么说
<44-1,BOBBY>Yeah, I pretty much am.

771
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,590
<44-2,BECKETT>这就是你参加占领活动的原因  为偷窃
<44-2,BECKETT>That's why you attended the Takeover! Protests?

772
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,080
<44-3,BOBBY>那么多人聚在一起
<44-3,BOBBY>All those people hanging out,

773
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,440
<44-3,BOBBY>各种和谐  各种友爱
<44-3,BOBBY>full of peace and brotherhood...

774
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,070
<44-3,BOBBY>占领华尔街
<44-3,BOBBY>Takeover! Wall Street!

775
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,670
<44-3,BOBBY>占领华尔街  华尔街
<44-3,BOBBY>Takeover! Wall Street! Wall Street,

776
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,180
<44-3,BOBBY>-我们要做什么  -占领华尔街
<44-3,BOBBY>- What do we want? - Takeover! Wall Street!

777
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,060
<44-3,BOBBY>愣小子  长长见识吧
<44-3,BOBBY>Hey, Nimrod. Here. Educate yourself.

778
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,280
<45-1,ANDREW HAYNES>给你  长长见识
<45-1,ANDREW HAYNES>Here. Educate--

779
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,300
<45-1,ANDREW HAYNES>占领华尔街  占领华尔街
<45-1,ANDREW HAYNES>Takeover! Wall Street! Takeover! Wall Street!

780
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,090
<46-1,CASTLE>就像是扒手的天堂
<46-1,CASTLE>Like an all-you-can-steal buffet.

781
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,170
<46-2,BOBBY>你懂的
<46-2,BOBBY>You got that right.

782
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,550
<46-3,BECKETT>你为何一开始不告诉我们真相
<46-3,BECKETT>Why didn't you just tell me the truth from the start?

783
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,590
<46-4,BOBBY>怎么  向怀疑我谋杀的警察
<46-4,BOBBY>And what, admit to a cop that likes me for murder

784
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,700
<46-4,BOBBY>承认自己是扒手吗
<46-4,BOBBY>that I'm a thief?

785
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,050
<46-4,BOBBY>-谎称失忆似乎更靠谱些吧  -是啊
<46-4,BOBBY>- Amnesia seemed like the better plan. - Yeah.

786
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,000
<46-5,CASTLE>那么说你顺走了安德鲁·海耶斯的手机
<46-5,CASTLE>So you lifted Andrew Haynes' phone,

787
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,120
<46-5,CASTLE>使我们误以为是他安置的炸弹
<46-5,CASTLE>which is why it looked as if he planted the bomb.

788
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,970
<46-6,BOBBY>谁是安德鲁·海耶斯
<46-6,BOBBY>Who's Andrew Haynes?

789
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,630
<46-7,BECKETT>不关你的事
<46-7,BECKETT>Don't worry about that.

790
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,760
<46-7,BECKETT>跟我说说背包是怎么回事
<46-7,BECKETT>Talk to me about the backpack.

791
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,080
<46-7,BECKETT>你是如何拿到它的
<46-7,BECKETT>How did you get it?

792
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,690
<46-7,BECKETT>懂吗  你们这些人  你们是病毒
<46-7,BECKETT>You know, you people, you're a virus.

793
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,820
<46-7,BECKETT>你们不负责任
<46-7,BECKETT>You're irresponsible.

794
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,790
<46-7,BECKETT>你们在毒害这个国家
<46-7,BECKETT>You're infecting this country.

795
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,240
<46-7,BECKETT>你好  你能听到吗
<46-7,BECKETT>Hello. Can you hear?

796
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,900
<46-7,BECKETT>你可能听不到...你能说英语吗
<46-7,BECKETT>You probably couldn't hear your--do you hablas English?

797
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,700
<47-1,BOBBY>我顺走了它
<47-1,BOBBY>I lifted it.

798
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,980
<48-1,BOBBY>它就躺在两个垃圾桶之间
<48-1,BOBBY>It was just lying there between two dumpsters.

799
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,040
<48-2,JESSE FRIEDMAN>嘿  别动  那是我的
<48-2,JESSE FRIEDMAN>Hey! Hey, that's mine.

<48-5,JESSE>- Come back! - Takeover! Wall Street! Takeover! Wall Street!

804
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,900
<48-5,JESSE>给我回来  嘿  你给我回来
<48-5,JESSE>Come back here. Hey, hey, you.

805
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,040
<48-5,JESSE>你离难缠新娘就差那么一步了
<48-5,JESSE>...this close to bridezilla territory.

806
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,930
<48-5,JESSE>或许结婚时我会穿牛仔裤
<48-5,JESSE>Oh, maybe I'll wear jeans to my wedding.

807
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,110
<48-5,JESSE>我们可以雇那个人当乐队
<48-5,JESSE>Maybe we can hire that guy as the band.

808
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,320
<48-5,JESSE>靠
<48-5,JESSE>Damn it!

809
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,360
<48-5,JESSE>我发誓
<48-5,JESSE>I swear, I...

810
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,640
<49-1,BOBBY>我不知道里面有炸弹
<49-1,BOBBY>I didn't know a bomb was in it.

811
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,470
<49-1,BOBBY>我不想伤害任何人
<49-1,BOBBY>I would never hurt anyone.

812
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,770
<49-1,BOBBY>你们得相信我
<49-1,BOBBY>Look, you gotta believe me.

813
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,950
<49-2,BECKETT>那个声称被偷背包的人
<49-2,BECKETT>The man who said that you took his backpack,

814
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,180
<49-2,BECKETT>是他吗
<49-2,BECKETT>Is that him?

815
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,630
<49-3,BOBBY>是的  就是这家伙
<49-3,BOBBY>Yeah. That--that's-- that's the guy.

816
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,140
<49-4,CASTLE>你确定吗
<49-4,CASTLE>Are you sure?

817
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,990
<49-4,CASTLE>是的
<49-4,CASTLE>Yeah.

818
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,460
<50-1,BOBBY>是的  就是他
<50-1,BOBBY>Yeah, that's him.

819
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,110
<50-1,BOBBY>那是杰西·弗里德曼
<50-1,BOBBY>That's Jesse Friedman.

820
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,800
<51-1,CASTLE>他是被害人之一
<51-1,CASTLE>He's one of the victims.

821
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,630
<51-2,BECKETT>而且他还是抗议活动的成员之一
<51-2,BECKETT>And he's a member of the movement.

822
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,450
<51-3,CASTLE>这说不通啊
<51-3,CASTLE>That doesn't make any sense.

823
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,380
<51-3,CASTLE>他为什么要袭击自己人
<51-3,CASTLE>Why would he attack his own people?

826
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,440
<52-1,BECKETT>好的  谢谢你
<52-1,BECKETT>Okay. Thank you.

827
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,220
<52-2,BECKETT>警员们搜查了杰西·弗里德曼的住所
<52-2,BECKETT>So unis searched Jesse Friedman's place.

828
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,060
<52-2,BECKETT>他们发现了研制
<52-2,BECKETT>and they found research on how to build

829
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,730
<52-2,BECKETT>与博亦伦广场相同炸弹装置的研究
<52-2,BECKETT>the same device that was used in Boylan Plaza.

830
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,870
<52-3,CASTLE>难道说杰西毁掉了自己的抗议活动
<52-3,CASTLE>So Jesse blew up his own protest?

831
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,710
<52-3,CASTLE>他为何要那样做
<52-3,CASTLE>Why would he do that?

832
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,940
<52-4,BECKETT>也许是想赢得公众们对他抗议活动的同情吧
<52-4,BECKETT>Maybe to get sympathy for his movement, publicity--

833
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,840
<52-5,CASTLE>而且由于他把炸弹安置在两个垃圾桶之间
<52-5,CASTLE>and since he placed the bomb between two dumpsters...

834
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,760
<52-6,BECKETT>他没料到会有人受伤
<52-6,BECKETT>He didn't think that anyone would get hurt.

835
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,530
<52-6,BECKETT>直到鲍比偷走了他的背包
<52-6,BECKETT>Then Bobby stole the backpack.

836
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,910
<52-7,CASTLE>如果杰西担心有人受伤
<52-7,CASTLE>If Jesse was worried about someone getting hurt,

837
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,270
<52-7,CASTLE>他为何还要引爆炸弹
<52-7,CASTLE>why would he set off the bomb?

838
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,700
<52-8,ESPOSITO>我认为不是他引爆的
<52-8,ESPOSITO>I don't think he did.

839
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,930
<52-8,ESPOSITO>他尸体附近没有发现遥控装置
<52-8,ESPOSITO>There was no remote found on or near the body,

840
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,250
<52-8,ESPOSITO>说明引爆者另有他人
<52-8,ESPOSITO>which means someone else detonated it.

841
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,710
<52-9,RYAN>也许是他认识的人
<52-9,RYAN>Probably somebody he knew.

842
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,100
<52-9,RYAN>炸弹爆炸前30秒
<52-9,RYAN>30 seconds before the blast,

843
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,570
<52-9,RYAN>杰西接到一个由一次性手机打来的电话
<52-9,RYAN>Jesse got a call on his cell from a burner phone.

844
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,020
<52-9,RYAN>炸弹爆炸前20秒
<52-9,RYAN>Then two seconds before the bomb went off,

845
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,920
<52-9,RYAN>他试图回拨那个号码
<52-9,RYAN>He tried to call that same phone back.

846
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,250
<52-10,BECKETT>所以杰西也许有个同伙
<52-10,BECKETT>So then maybe Jesse had a partner,

847
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,010
<52-10,BECKETT>就是那人引爆了炸弹
<52-10,BECKETT>and that's who triggered the bomb.

848
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,250
<52-11,CASTLE>你曾说遥控装置只有30米的有效范围  是吧
<52-11,CASTLE>You said that remote had a range of about 100 feet, right?

849
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,270
<52-12,ESPOSITO>所以无论他的同伙是谁
<52-12,ESPOSITO>So whoever the partner was,

850
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,030
<52-13,CASTLE>他一定在这附近
<52-13,CASTLE>he must have been here somewhere,

851
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,870
<52-13,CASTLE>靠近炸弹的引爆点
<52-13,CASTLE>close to the bomb blast,

852
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,270
<52-13,CASTLE>隐匿在人群中
<52-13,CASTLE>hidden among the crowd.

853
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,540
<52-13,CASTLE>我们得重新梳理一下事件顺序
<52-13,CASTLE>We need to take another look at the sequence of events,

854
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,360
<52-13,CASTLE>把目击者的证词整合起来
<52-13,CASTLE>piece together the witness statements.

855
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,400
<52-13,CASTLE>答案将自在其中
<52-13,CASTLE>The answer is in the story.

856
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,040
<52-13,CASTLE>我们从头开始
<52-13,CASTLE>So let's start at the beginning.

857
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,720
<52-13,CASTLE>占领华尔街
<52-13,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street!

858
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,380
<52-13,CASTLE>占领华尔街
<52-13,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street!

859
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,800
<52-13,CASTLE>占领华尔街  占领华尔街
<52-13,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street! Takeover! Wall Street!

860
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,260
<53-1,CASTLE>琳安和她的摄像师正在准备
<53-1,CASTLE>Leann and her cameraman are setting up

861
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,360
<53-1,CASTLE>他们的现场直播
<53-1,CASTLE>for their live broadcast.

862
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,360
<53-2,LEANN>要把后面的人群都拍进去  马克
<53-2,LEANN>Be sure you get the crowd in the background, Mark.

863
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,370
<53-2,LEANN>最后拍你一次你和抗议人群的合影
<53-2,LEANN>Another shot of you and the chanting masses.

864
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,750
<53-3,MARK>我再也不想来拍抗议了
<53-3,MARK>I'm so over this protest.

865
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,340
<53-4,LEANN>下次我们去拍巴西T台模特  我保证
<53-4,LEANN>Next time we'll do a piece on brazilian runway models, I promise.

866
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,540
<53-4,LEANN>说话算数
<53-4,LEANN>Gonna hold you to that.

867
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,730
<53-5,MARK>好了  我们开拍吧
<53-5,MARK>All right. Let's roll this puppy.

868
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,620
<53-6,LEANN>占领华尔街
<53-6,LEANN>Takeover! Wall Street!

869
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,660
<53-6,LEANN>收到
<53-6,LEANN>Roger that.

870
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,820
<53-7,CASTLE>与此同时
<53-7,CASTLE>At the same time,

871
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,440
<53-7,CASTLE>鲍比在广场上徘徊
<53-7,CASTLE>Bobby's prowling the plaza.

872
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,020
<53-7,CASTLE>他看到安德鲁·海耶斯正对示威者们高谈阔论
<53-7,CASTLE>He sees Andrew Haynes haranguing the protesters.

873
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,150
<53-7,CASTLE>少在这儿求同情了
<53-7,CASTLE>Quit the pity party.

874
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,780
<53-8,HAYNES>自力更生你懂不懂
<53-8,HAYNES>Pull yourself up by the bootstraps.

875
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,650
<45-1,ANDREW HAYNES>愣小子  长长见识吧
<45-1,ANDREW HAYNES>Hey, Nimrod. Here. Educate yourself.

876
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,600
<53-7,CASTLE>拿着  好好看看吧
<53-7,CASTLE>Here, why don't you give this a read?

877
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,130
<53-8,HAYNES>嘿  幼齿大叔
<53-8,HAYNES>Hey, garanimal pants.

878
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,650
<54-1,CASTLE>他很容易下手
<54-1,CASTLE>He's easy pickings.

879
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,900
<54-1,CASTLE>给你  长...
<54-1,CASTLE>Here, educ--

880
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,380
<54-1,CASTLE>就这样  鲍比偷走了他的手机
<54-1,CASTLE>So Bobby relieves him of his phone.

881
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,550
<55-1,CASTLE>占领华尔街
<55-1,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street!

882
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,400
<55-2,ANDREW>长长见识吧
<55-2,ANDREW>Educate yourself, would you?

883
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,550
<55-3,CASTLE>接着  鲍比继续寻找下一个"商机"
<55-3,CASTLE>Then Bobby goes looking for his next business opportunity.

884
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,800
<55-3,CASTLE>他发现了无人看管的蓝色背包
<55-3,CASTLE>He spots the blue backpack unattended,

885
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,320
<55-3,CASTLE>向他呼唤
<55-3,CASTLE>calling out to him.

886
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,680
<55-3,CASTLE>他拿起那个背包
<55-3,CASTLE>So he grabs it,

887
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,290
<55-3,CASTLE>欣喜若狂而没有意识到包里面装的是什么
<55-3,CASTLE>blissfully unaware of what's inside.

888
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,470
<55-3,CASTLE>包是我的
<55-3,CASTLE>Hey! Hey, that's mine.

889
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,770
<56-1,CASTLE>但杰西看到后失控了
<56-1,CASTLE>But Jesse sees him and he flips out.

890
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,340
<56-1,CASTLE>还给我  包是我的
<56-1,CASTLE>Give me that. That's mine!

891
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,620
<48-1,BOBBY>把包还给我
<48-1,BOBBY>Give that back!

892
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,540
<48-2,JESSE FRIEDMAN>嘿  嘿  包是我的
<48-2,JESSE FRIEDMAN>Hey! Hey! That's mine!

893
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,070
<57-3,CASTLE>鲍比消失在人群中  杰西慌了
<57-3,CASTLE>Bobby ducks out of sight. Jesse panics.

894
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,610
<57-3,CASTLE>炸弹在移动
<57-3,CASTLE>The bomb is on the move.

895
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,590
<57-3,CASTLE>他会怎么做呢
<57-3,CASTLE>What's he gonna do?

896
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,260
<57-3,CASTLE>人们身处危险之中
<57-3,CASTLE>People are in danger.

897
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,340
<57-3,CASTLE>他抓住一个穿着黑色连帽衫的人
<57-3,CASTLE>He grabs a man in a black hoodie,

898
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,410
<57-3,CASTLE>以为他就是小偷
<57-3,CASTLE>thinking it's the thief.

899
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,000
<57-4,HAYNES>你干嘛
<57-4,HAYNES>What's your problem?

900
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,360
<57-4,HAYNES>-你不爽我说的话吗  -对不起
<57-4,HAYNES>- You don't like what I have to say? - Sorry.

901
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,430
<57-5,JESSE>没法面对现实吗
<57-5,JESSE>Huh? Can't face the truth?

902
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,050
<57-5,JESSE>那人就是安德鲁·海耶斯
<57-5,JESSE>But it's Andrew Haynes.

903
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,560
<57-6,HAYNES>接管华尔街  接管华尔街
<57-6,HAYNES>Takeover! Wall Street! Takeover! Wall Street!

904
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,770
<57-6,HAYNES>这时  鲍比意识到
<57-6,HAYNES>But by now, Bobby's decided

905
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,120
<57-7,CASTLE>提着背包并不明智
<57-7,CASTLE>taking the backpack wasn't such a good idea.

906
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,570
<57-7,CASTLE>接管华尔街  接管华尔街
<57-7,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street! Takeover! Wall Street!

907
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,540
<57-8,CASTLE>所以他把包丢在一边就走了
<57-8,CASTLE>So he ditches it and keeps moving.

908
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,780
<57-9,NADIA>你能想象妈妈会是什么表情吗
<57-9,NADIA>Could you imagine the look on mom's face?

909
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,720
<57-10,NADIA>-嘭  -靠
<57-10,NADIA>- Bam. - Damn it!

910
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,980
<57-11,CASTLE>他们不小心撞到
<57-11,CASTLE>They bump into each other,

911
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,410
<57-11,CASTLE>这一幕恰巧被咖啡卡车旁的
<57-11,CASTLE>drawing the attention of the street drummer

912
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,350
<57-11,CASTLE>街鼓手看到
<57-11,CASTLE>who's now by the coffee truck.

913
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,180
<57-12,OPERATOR>你所拨打的电话
<57-12,OPERATOR>The subscriber you're trying

914
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,770
<57-12,OPERATOR>暂时未能接通
<57-12,OPERATOR>to reach is not available--

915
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,170
<58-1,CASTLE>他太迟了
<58-1,CASTLE>He's too late.

916
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,970
<58-2,ESPOSITO>兄弟  故事不错
<58-2,ESPOSITO>Well, that's a nice story, bro,

917
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,740
<58-2,ESPOSITO>但仍然不能告诉我们杰西的同伙是谁
<58-2,ESPOSITO>but it still doesn't tell us who Jesse's partner is.

918
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,670
<58-3,BECKETT>肯定是炸弹爆炸前
<58-3,BECKETT>Well, it's gotta be whoever Jesse was on the phone with

919
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,780
<58-3,BECKETT>同杰西通电话的人
<58-3,BECKETT>in the minutes before the bomb went off.

920
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,240
<58-4,CASTLE>第一通来电通话多久
<58-4,CASTLE>How long was that first incoming call?

921
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,830
<58-5,RYAN>八秒
<58-5,RYAN>Uh, eight seconds.

922
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,780
<58-6,CASTLE>所以有可能是说"准备就绪"之类的话
<58-6,CASTLE>So that was probably the "All systems go" Call.

923
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,720
<58-7,RYAN>然而在背包被偷后
<58-7,RYAN>Then after the backpack was stolen,

924
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,440
<58-7,RYAN>杰西试图告诉同伙"一切尚未就绪"
<58-7,RYAN>Jesse tried to make an "All systems not go" Call,

925
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,750
<58-7,RYAN>可他没来得及
<58-7,RYAN>but he didn't get through in time.

926
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,070
<58-8,BECKETT>有目击者记得
<58-8,BECKETT>Do any of the witnesses remember

927
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,620
<58-8,BECKETT>杰西是和谁一起去的吗
<58-8,BECKETT>who Jesse was hanging out with?

928
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,820
<58-9,ESPOSITO>没有  但我们在根据他朋友的叙述
<58-9,ESPOSITO>Not yet, but we're still reconstructing his movements

929
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,010
<58-9,ESPOSITO>重组他的一举一动
<58-9,ESPOSITO>based on statements from his friends--

930
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:14,300
<58-10,CASTLE>贝多芬T恤
<58-10,CASTLE>A Beethoven T-shirt.

931
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,150
<58-10,CASTLE>电话  应答
<58-10,CASTLE>A call-and-response.

932
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
<58-10,CASTLE>我知道杰西的同伙是谁了
<58-10,CASTLE>I know who Jesse's partner is.

933
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,560
<58-10,CASTLE>接管华尔街
<58-10,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street!

934
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,730
<59-1,CASTLE>鲍比说在他偷背包之前
<59-1,CASTLE>Bobby remembered hearing a Beethoven ringtone

935
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,620
<59-1,CASTLE>听到附近响起
<59-1,CASTLE>coming from nearby

936
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,410
<59-1,CASTLE>贝多芬曲子的铃声
<59-1,CASTLE>just before he stole the backpack.

937
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,780
<59-1,CASTLE>同时西区瓦利也说过
<59-1,CASTLE>And West Side Wally said

938
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,660
<59-1,CASTLE>贝多芬出现
<59-1,CASTLE>Beethoven showed up,

939
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,540
<59-1,CASTLE>演奏其著名的"第五交响曲"
<59-1,CASTLE>conducting his "Fifth Symphony."

940
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,700
<59-1,CASTLE>准备好了
<59-1,CASTLE>We're good to go.

941
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,750
<60-1,CASTLE>就在那时穿着贝多芬T恤
<60-1,CASTLE>That was actually Jesse Friedman

942
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,690
<60-1,CASTLE>以贝多芬曲子作铃声的杰西·弗里德曼
<60-1,CASTLE>with his Beethoven T-shirt and ringtone,

943
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,360
<60-1,CASTLE>打了那通"准备就绪"的电话
<60-1,CASTLE>making his "All systems go" Call.

944
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,660
<61-1,JESSE>准备好了
<61-1,JESSE>We're good to go.

945
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,190
<61-2,CASTLE>我们知道他在和100英尺范围内的人通话
<61-2,CASTLE>We know he was talking to someone within 100 feet

946
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,960
<61-2,CASTLE>且通话时间八秒
<61-2,CASTLE>and that call lasted eight seconds.

947
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,860
<61-2,CASTLE>足够双方应答
<61-2,CASTLE>Long enough for a call-and-response--

948
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,880
<61-2,CASTLE>这个应答的人
<61-2,CASTLE>A call-and-response to the one person

949
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,510
<61-2,CASTLE>能够让爆炸经过在电视直播中呈现
<61-2,CASTLE>who could broadcast the explosion live on television

950
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,980
<61-2,CASTLE>给公众带来活动所需要的震撼
<61-2,CASTLE>and bring the publicity that the movement needed.

951
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,380
<61-3,JESSE>准备好了
<61-3,JESSE>We're good to go.

952
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,090
<61-3,JESSE>收到
<61-3,JESSE>Roger that.

953
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,860
<61-4,LEANN>准备
<61-4,LEANN>Live in...

954
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,110
<61-4,LEANN>三
<61-4,LEANN>Three...

955
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,700
<61-5,LEANN>我现在在博亦伦广场
<61-5,LEANN>I'm here at Boylan Plaza on day 36

956
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,880
<61-5,LEANN>现在是占领抗议的第36天
<61-5,LEANN>of the Takeover! Protest.

957
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,540
<62-1,CASTLE>接电话的就是琳安·韦斯特
<62-1,CASTLE>Leann West was on the other end of that phone.

958
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,410
<62-1,CASTLE>接管华尔街
<62-1,CASTLE>Takeover! Wall Street!

959
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:17,940
<62-1,CASTLE>收到
<62-1,CASTLE>Roger that.

960
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,260
<62-1,CASTLE>不  我没有
<62-1,CASTLE>No, I wasn't.

961
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,530
<63-1,LEANN>我没和任何人通话
<63-1,LEANN>I wasn't on the phone with anyone.

962
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,070
<63-1,LEANN>我是在和摄影师讲话
<63-1,LEANN>I was talking to my cameraman.

963
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,920
<63-1,LEANN>我已经向联调局说了整个经过
<63-1,LEANN>I already told the FBI the whole story.

964
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,990
<63-2,CASTLE>不过你漏掉了些细节
<63-2,CASTLE>Yeah, except you left out a few details.

965
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,710
<63-3,BECKETT>比如你认识杰西·弗里德曼
<63-3,BECKETT>Like the fact that you knew Jesse Friedman.

966
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,070
<63-3,BECKETT>你们是哈德逊大学的校友
<63-3,BECKETT>The two of you went to Hudson University.

967
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,700
<63-4,LEANN>对  很多人都是啊
<63-4,LEANN>Yeah, so did a lot of people.

968
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,780
<63-5,CASTLE>我们猜想你们在抗议活动中重遇
<63-5,CASTLE>We're guessing the two of you reunited at the protest.

969
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,650
<63-5,CASTLE>一起喝东西叙旧  然后你想到一计
<63-5,CASTLE>You went out for drinks and you hatched a plan.

970
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,650
<63-6,BECKETT>他想让抗议活动得到媒体关注
<63-6,BECKETT>He wanted media attention for the movement.

971
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,780
<63-6,BECKETT>而你想晋升到主播台
<63-6,BECKETT>You wanted to get promoted to the anchor desk.

972
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,850
<63-7,CASTLE>所以你将摄影机摆到最好的拍摄角度
<63-7,CASTLE>So you set up your cameras at the perfect vantage point.

973
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,110
<63-8,BECKETT>当你开始直播时
<63-8,BECKETT>You waited until you went live

974
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,020
<63-8,BECKETT>就引爆了炸弹
<63-8,BECKETT>and you detonated that bomb.

975
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,370
<63-8,BECKETT>什么
<63-8,BECKETT>What?

976
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,500
<63-9,LEANN>神经
<63-9,LEANN>That is insane.

977
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,270
<63-9,LEANN>这太荒谬了
<63-9,LEANN>This is ridiculous,

978
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,600
<63-9,LEANN>我不想再听下去了
<63-9,LEANN>and I will not listen to another word of it.

979
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,990
<63-9,LEANN>我们到此为止
<63-9,LEANN>We're done here.

980
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,860
<63-10,BECKETT>还认得吗
<63-10,BECKETT>Do you recognize that?

981
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,350
<63-10,BECKETT>你打给杰西时用的一次性手机
<63-10,BECKETT>That's the burner cell that you used to call Jesse.

982
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,230
<63-11,CASTLE>我们在博亦伦广场两个街区外的
<63-11,CASTLE>Found it in a storm drain

983
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,440
<63-11,CASTLE>下水沟找到的
<63-11,CASTLE>about two blocks from Boylan Plaza.

984
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,220
<63-11,CASTLE>知道我们还找到什么了吗
<63-11,CASTLE>You know what else we found in there?

985
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,120
<63-11,CASTLE>你用来远程引爆炸弹的遥控器
<63-11,CASTLE>The remote you used to detonate the bomb.

986
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,930
<63-12,BECKETT>小得足够你藏在手中
<63-12,BECKETT>Small enough to hide in the palm of your hand.

987
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,500
<63-12,BECKETT>琳安  上面都是你的指纹
<63-12,BECKETT>It's got your fingerprints all over it, Leann.

988
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,450
<63-13,LEANN>你们怎么找到的
<63-13,LEANN>How did you find that?

989
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,390
<63-14,CASTLE>用你手机的GPS导航系统
<63-14,CASTLE>By tracking your movements after the explosion

990
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,260
<63-14,CASTLE>追踪爆炸后你的活动路线
<63-14,CASTLE>using your phone's GPS.

991
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,190
<63-15,LEANN>我没想过伤害他人的
<63-15,LEANN>No one was supposed to get hurt.

992
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,980
<63-15,LEANN>我只想单纯制造些响声
<63-15,LEANN>It was just gonna make a lot of noise,

993
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,060
<63-15,LEANN>那样人们就会开始关注我这个播报员
<63-15,LEANN>and people would start respecting me as a reporter,

994
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,230
<63-15,LEANN>但所有事都偏离轨道了
<63-15,LEANN>but everything just went wrong.

995
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,490
<63-16,BECKETT>那在你意识到自己的所为之后
<63-16,BECKETT>Why didn't you come forward

996
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,020
<63-16,BECKETT>为什么没有站出来承担一切
<63-16,BECKETT>once you realized what you had done?

997
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,870
<63-17,LEANN>我考虑过的
<63-17,LEANN>I thought about it,

998
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,530
<63-17,LEANN>可那能帮到什么呢
<63-17,LEANN>but what good would that do?

999
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,000
<63-17,LEANN>我为杰西保密
<63-17,LEANN>I kept quiet for Jesse.

1000
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,070
<63-18,LEANN>我不想毁了他的声誉
<63-18,LEANN>I wanted to protect his memory.

1001
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,960
<63-19,CASTLE>那就是你朋友杰西所说的
<63-19,CASTLE>Well, that's what your friend Jesse would call

1002
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,040
<63-19,CASTLE>沉默即是犯罪
<63-19,CASTLE>sinning by silence.

1003
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,410
<63-19,CASTLE>并非明智之举
<63-19,CASTLE>It's not smart.

1004
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,190
<63-19,CASTLE>一点都不勇敢
<63-19,CASTLE>It's not brave.

1005
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,550
<63-19,CASTLE>只是怯弱罢了
<63-19,CASTLE>It's just cowardly.

1006
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,480
<64-1,GATES>联邦调查局已逮捕琳安·韦斯特
<64-1,GATES>The FBI has taken Leann West into custody.

1007
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,610
<64-1,GATES>她为了满足其盲目的野心
<64-1,GATES>This woman, whose blind ambition

1008
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,240
<64-1,GATES>致使五人无辜丧命
<64-1,GATES>led to the death of five people,

1009
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,220
<64-1,GATES>她将受到其应有的惩罚
<64-1,GATES>will get what she deserves.

1010
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,460
<64-1,GATES>我
<64-1,GATES>I, um...

1011
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,500
<64-1,GATES>我要谢谢你们每个人
<64-1,GATES>I want to thank each of you

1012
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,660
<64-1,GATES>为这个案子所做的一切
<64-1,GATES>for what you did to make this happen.

1013
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,220
<64-1,GATES>你们
<64-1,GATES>You, uh...

1014
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,840
<64-1,GATES>都付出了百分之一百一的心血
<64-1,GATES>All put in 110%,

1015
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,540
<64-1,GATES>我深感自豪
<64-1,GATES>Made me proud.

1016
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,520
<64-1,GATES>我们现在
<64-1,GATES>So let's, uh...

1017
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,220
<64-1,GATES>散会  赶紧回家
<64-1,GATES>get outta here, head on home,

1018
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,590
<64-1,GATES>好好休息
<64-1,GATES>and catch up on some much-needed rest.

1019
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,410
<64-2,BECKETT>我还是有点烦躁不安
<64-2,BECKETT>You know what? I'm still kind of wired.

1020
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,240
<64-2,BECKETT>要一起去喝杯东西吗
<64-2,BECKETT>Do you guys want to go out for a drink?

1021
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,430
<64-2,BECKETT>抱歉
<64-2,BECKETT>Oh, I'm sorry.

1022
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,780
<64-3,RYAN>我太想珍妮了  一日不见如隔三秋
<64-3,RYAN>You know, it feels like a month since I've seen Jenny.

1023
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,490
<64-3,RYAN>-我得回家去  -我也是
<64-3,RYAN>- I should really get home. - Me, too.

1024
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,810
<64-4,ESPOSITO>我醉了肯定会对你大发牢骚的
<64-4,ESPOSITO>I'm tanked. I'll holler at you.

1025
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,220
<64-5,BECKETT>所以就我们俩去了
<64-5,BECKETT>So I guess it's just us.

1026
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,410
<64-6,CASTLE>嗯
<64-6,CASTLE>Yeah.

1027
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,130
<64-7,BECKETT>现在案子结束了
<64-7,BECKETT>You know, now that the case is done...

1028
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,000
<64-7,BECKETT>你想跟我说什么来着
<64-7,BECKETT>What did you want to talk about?

1029
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,790
<64-8,CASTLE>没什么
<64-8,CASTLE>Nothing.

1030
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,400
<64-8,CASTLE>不是什么重要的事
<64-8,CASTLE>Nothing important anyway.

1031
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,490
<64-9,CASTLE>我回家了
