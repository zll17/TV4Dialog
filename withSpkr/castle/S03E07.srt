<4-1,BECKETT>纽约警局
<4-1,BECKETT>NYPD.

22

<26-2,CASTLE>Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,720
<2-1,MARTHA>-放松  -放松
<2-1,MARTHA>- And relax. - And relax.

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,270
<2-2,CASTLE>我做了个梦
<2-2,CASTLE>I had a dream.

29
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,900
<2-2,CASTLE>梦中我浮在一片睡莲叶子上
<2-2,CASTLE>I was floating on a lily pad,

30
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,920
<2-2,CASTLE>而一队身穿比基尼的瑞典人
<2-2,CASTLE>and the swedish bikini team

31
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,540
<2-2,CASTLE>则在朗诵《希特热浪》的好评
<2-2,CASTLE>was reciting positive reviews of "Naked Heat."

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,710
<2-3,MARTHA>-想必是个美梦  -对啊
<2-3,MARTHA>- Oh. Well, that must have been lovely. - Yeah.

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,860
<2-5,MARTHA>不过你告诉我们干什么
<2-5,MARTHA>Why are you telling us this?

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,670
<2-6,CASTLE>因为  多亏了你们
<2-6,CASTLE>Well, because of you,

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,020
<2-6,CASTLE>我的瑞典天堂变成了猫鸣不断的收容所
<2-6,CASTLE>my swedish paradise turned into a wailing cat shelter.

36
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,740
<2-7,ALEXIS>我们正在做发声练习
<2-7,ALEXIS>We're doing voice exercises

37
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,400
<2-7,ALEXIS>以增强腹式呼吸
<2-7,ALEXIS>to strengthen abdominal breathing.

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,500
<2-8,CASTLE>在清晨5点吗
<2-8,CASTLE>At 5:00 a.m.?

39
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,480
<2-9,MARTHA>准备充足  才能带来富有灵感的试演
<2-9,MARTHA>Preparation is the foundation of an inspired audition.

40
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,270
<2-9,MARTHA>啊哈
<2-9,MARTHA>Ha ha!

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,940
<2-10,ALEXIS>我昨晚跟奶奶提过我正在考虑
<2-10,ALEXIS>I mentioned to gram last night that I was thinking about

42
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,520
<2-10,ALEXIS>参加学校音乐剧《火爆浪子》的面试
<2-10,ALEXIS>trying out for "Grease" at my school.

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,550
<2-11,CASTLE>噢  又是"奶奶会乐此不疲
<2-11,CASTLE>Oh. The old "Gram goes overboard

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,720
<2-11,CASTLE>是因为认定你天生是演员"的老一套
<2-11,CASTLE>because acting is in your bones" routine.

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
<2-13,CASTLE>-正是  -是呀
<2-13,CASTLE>- Apparently. - Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,180
<2-13,CASTLE>告诉她试演一事太轻举妄动了
<2-13,CASTLE>Rookie move, telling her about the audition.

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,690
<2-14,ALEXIS>其实我也不确定是否有空参加所有社团
<2-14,ALEXIS>I wasn't sure I'd have time with all my other clubs,

49
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,820
<2-14,ALEXIS>只是觉得好玩而已
<2-14,ALEXIS>but I thought it might be fun.

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,450
<2-14,ALEXIS>我也不知道她会
<2-14,ALEXIS>I didn't know she'd wake

51
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,300
<2-14,ALEXIS>-天没亮就叫醒我  -我懂
<2-14,ALEXIS>- me up when it was still dark outside. - I see.

52
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,630
<2-15,MARTHA>一个演员要懂得为演技牺牲
<2-15,MARTHA>An actor learns to make sacrifices for his craft.

53
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,870
<2-15,MARTHA>而且  当我们入土为安时
<2-15,MARTHA>Besides, we'll all have plenty of time to sleep

54
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,700
<2-15,MARTHA>有大把时间睡觉
<2-15,MARTHA>when we're dead.

55
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,980
<2-16,CASTLE>说曹操  曹操到
<2-16,CASTLE>Oh, speaking of dead.

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,390
<2-16,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<2-16,CASTLE>Castle.

57
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,380
<2-16,CASTLE>不  别傻了  我早醒了
<2-16,CASTLE>Nah. No, no, don't be silly. Of course I was up.

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,490
<3-1,CASTLE>天啊  为什么那么着急
<3-1,CASTLE>Jeez. What's the big hurry?

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,310
<3-1,CASTLE>死者尸体又不会到处闲逛  对吧
<3-1,CASTLE>Victim's not going anywhere, right?

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,560
<3-2,BECKETT>这次非同小可
<3-2,BECKETT>This one's different.

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,890
<3-3,LANIE>-蕾妮  -听说有个警员遇袭了
<3-3,LANIE>- Lanie. - Heard we got an officer down.

62
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,110
<3-4,BECKETT>-对  通知是这样说的  -谁遇袭了
<3-4,BECKETT>- Yep. That's the word. - Who is it?

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,190
<3-5,CASTLE>暂时未知  但一个的士司机
<3-5,CASTLE>Don't know, but a cab driver called 9-1-1

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,610
<3-6,BECKETT>在停车抽烟后报了警
<3-6,BECKETT>after he parked and stopped for a smoke.

65
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,860
<3-7,LANIE>让我看看
<3-7,LANIE>Let's see.

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,400
<3-7,LANIE>胸口中了一枪
<3-7,LANIE>Single gunshot wound to the chest.

67
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,500
<3-7,LANIE>这位仁兄并没有穿防弹背心
<3-7,LANIE>And our guy isn't wearing his kevlar.

68
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,040
<3-8,BECKETT>能让我靠近看看吗
<3-8,BECKETT>Mind if I step in there for a sec?

69
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,000
<3-9,BECKETT>他属于皇后区116号警局
<3-9,BECKETT>It's from the 116 in Queens.

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,900
<3-9,BECKETT>但这个警章式样老旧
<3-9,BECKETT>This is an old-style badge, though.

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,330
<3-10,CASTLE>也许他念旧  不愿放下警察生涯的
<3-10,CASTLE>Maybe he's old-school, didn't want to give up the badge

72
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,710
<3-10,CASTLE>光辉岁月呢
<3-10,CASTLE>he built his career on.

73
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,080
<3-11,LANIE>卡塞尔  他才20多岁
<3-11,LANIE>Castle, he's mid-20s.

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,180
<3-12,CASTLE>你听说过名叫杜奇·豪塞的天才医师吗
<3-12,CASTLE>You ever heard of a brilliant doctor named Doogie Howser?

76
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,520
<3-13,BECKETT>是假枪
<3-13,BECKETT>It's fake.

77
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,280
<3-14,CASTLE>是龙舌兰酒
<3-14,CASTLE>That's tequila.

78
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,160
<3-14,CASTLE>还是劣等酒
<3-14,CASTLE>That's cheap tequila.

79
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,220
<3-14,CASTLE>而且这枪该加酒了
<3-14,CASTLE>And he needed a refill.

80
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,470
<3-15,BECKETT>一把水枪和一个旧警章
<3-15,BECKETT>So a squirt gun and an old badge--

81
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,720
<3-15,BECKETT>显然他不是警察
<3-15,BECKETT>clearly he's not a cop.

82
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,250
<3-16,CASTLE>也许他在假扮警察  戏弄无知妇孺呢
<3-16,CASTLE>Maybe he was impersonating one to prey on vulnerable women.

83
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,610
<3-17,BECKETT>用一把灌了龙舌兰的水枪吗
<3-17,BECKETT>Armed with a tequila pistol?

84
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,630
<3-18,LANIE>恰恰相反  我倒觉得是女人在戏弄他
<3-18,LANIE>Actually, I think women were preying on him.

85
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
<3-19,CASTLE>魔术贴裤子
<3-19,CASTLE>Tear away pants?

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,420
<3-20,BECKETT>他是脱衣舞男
<3-20,BECKETT>He's a stripper.

87
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,150
<3-20,BECKETT>我没找到任何身份证明
<3-20,BECKETT>I'm not finding any I.D.

88
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,580
<3-20,BECKETT>但他有车
<3-20,BECKETT>He does have a car.

89
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,990
<3-21,CASTLE>在偌大一个城市  大小罪案无数
<3-21,CASTLE>Of all the cases in the city, and it's a big city,

90
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,030
<3-21,CASTLE>唯独你遇上脱衣舞男
<3-21,CASTLE>you catch a male stripper.

91
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,820
<3-22,BECKETT>是呀  我想我运气好吧
<3-22,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, luck of the draw, I guess.

92
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,130
<3-23,CASTLE>对啊  我只是说说而已
<3-23,CASTLE>Yeah. I'm--I'm just sayin'.

93
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,260
<3-23,CASTLE>我只是想说  我要坐副驾驶座
<3-23,CASTLE>I'm just sayin'. Shotgun.

94
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,150
<3-24,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  没人跟你抢  -那是
<3-24,BECKETT>- Castle, you're the only one here. - Yes.

95
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,580
<3-26,CASTLE>这环境让我想起自己的第一间宿舍
<3-26,CASTLE>This place reminds me of my first dorm room.

96
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,360
<3-27,BECKETT>死者叫德里克·博克纳
<3-27,BECKETT>Victim's name is Derek Brookner.

97
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,240
<3-27,BECKETT>27岁
<3-27,BECKETT>He's 27.

98
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,430
<3-28,CASTLE>看  他在存款单背后写了个地址
<3-28,CASTLE>Hey. He wrote an address on the back of this deposit slip.

99
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,660
<3-28,CASTLE>"西59街423号  4B"
<3-28,CASTLE>"423 West 59th. 4-B."

100
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,140
<3-28,CASTLE>就在街角处
<3-28,CASTLE>That's right around the corner.

101
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,620
<3-29,BECKETT>他的尸体正好就在
<3-29,BECKETT>And his body was found halfway between

102
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,920
<3-29,BECKETT>这个地址和车之间
<3-29,BECKETT>that location and this car.

103
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,880
<3-30,CASTLE>要赌一赌吗  他准是去了这个地方
<3-30,CASTLE>What do you want to bet that's where he was coming from?

104
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,100
<4-1,BECKETT>纽约警局  开门

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,280
<4-7,SARAH LIEBERMAN>又来一个脱衣舞男
<4-7,SARAH LIEBERMAN>Another stripper?

<4-10,JAMIE RUIZ>Ladies, I am not a stripper, though I can understand

116
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,070
<4-11,CASTLE>你们何以会认错
<4-11,CASTLE>how you'd make that mistake.

117
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,090
<4-12,BECKETT>纽约警察  真枪实弹的警察
<4-12,BECKETT>NYPD--the ones with the real guns.

<4-12,BECKETT>我们来调查德里克·博克纳的死因
<4-12,BECKETT>We're here to investigate the murder of Derek Brookner.

119
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,040
<4-13,CASTLE>我们认为他是你们昨晚派对的娱乐嘉宾
<4-13,CASTLE>We believe he was your entertainment for last night's soiree.

120
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,860
<4-14,KATHLEEN PARK>噢天啊  你是说顽皮警官吗
<4-14,KATHLEEN PARK>Oh, my god. Officer Mcnaughty?

121
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,370
<4-15,BECKETT>我要知道
<4-15,BECKETT>I need to know

122
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,940
<4-15,BECKETT>他昨天到来和离开的确切时间
<4-15,BECKETT>the exact time that he arrived and left yesterday.

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,520
<4-17,SARAH LIEBERMAN>-是晚上  -他的舞蹈可长了
<4-17,SARAH LIEBERMAN>- It was dark. - And his dance was long.

124
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,450
<4-18,JAMIE RUIZ>不光是舞蹈长
<4-18,JAMIE RUIZ>That's not all that was long.

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,660
<4-19,BECKETT>我想去一趟警局  你们就会记起来了
<4-19,BECKETT>I think a trip down to the station will jog everyone's memories.

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,690
<4-20,KATHLEEN PARK>能中途停下让我们吃个早午茶吗
<4-20,KATHLEEN PARK>Could we stop and get brunch on the way?

128
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,180
<5-1,ESPOSITO>利伯曼小姐

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,120
<5-1,ESPOSITO>昨晚的事你记得多少
<5-1,ESPOSITO>do you remember anything about last night?

130
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,140
<5-1,ESPOSITO>德里克昨晚遇害时还穿着舞男装
<5-1,ESPOSITO>Derek was still wearing his costume when was killed last night,

131
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,110
<5-1,ESPOSITO>人也一直没回到车上
<5-1,ESPOSITO>and he never made it to his car,

132
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,670
<6-1,BECKETT>所以你们是最后见到他还活着的人
<6-1,BECKETT>which makes your party the last place that he was seen alive.

133
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,830
<6-2,JAMIE RUIZ>他昨晚走的时候还好好的
<6-2,JAMIE RUIZ>Well, he seemed fine when he left, right?

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,470
<7-11,CASTLE>从照片看来她和德里克相识啊
<7-11,CASTLE>It looks as though she and Derek know each other.

169
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,340
<7-12,KATHLEEN PARK>没听她说过
<7-12,KATHLEEN PARK>She never mentioned anything.

<7-15,ESPOSITO>在她把他的东西全扔出窗外后
<7-15,ESPOSITO>filed a restraining order against her

177
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
<7-15,ESPOSITO>对她申请了一张禁令
<7-15,ESPOSITO>after she threw all his stuff out the window.

178
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,590
<7-16,CASTLE>作为一个交过几个跟踪狂女友的男人
<7-16,CASTLE>Well, as a man who's dated several rabbit boilers,

179
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,040

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,300
<7-17,BECKETT>是啊  但一张禁令
<7-17,BECKETT>Yeah, but a restraining order

181
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,860
<7-17,BECKETT>并不代表她就是凶手
<7-17,BECKETT>doesn't mean that she's our killer.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,060
<7-18,ESPOSITO>是啊  除非他的前男友
<7-18,ESPOSITO>Yeah, except that her ex-boyfriend

183

<7-21,RYAN>和一堆唐纳德·特朗普著的经济书籍
<7-21,RYAN>and a bunch of Donald Trump books about finance.

189
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,100
<7-22,CASTLE>也许德里克梦想成为企业家呢
<7-22,CASTLE>Maybe Derek dreams about being an entrepreneur,

190
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,520
<7-22,CASTLE>又或者他只是《飞黄腾达》的粉丝
<7-22,CASTLE>or maybe he's just a fan of "Celebrity Apprentice."

191
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
<7-23,BECKETT>还有别的吗
<7-23,BECKETT>Anything else?

192
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,660
<7-24,RYAN>这里有张日程表  什么也没写
<7-24,RYAN>There was a day planner with nothing in it

193
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,940
<7-24,RYAN>只有张名片  上面的人名是杰西·曼德勒
<7-24,RYAN>but a business card for a guy named Jesse Mandalay.

194
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,700
<7-25,BECKETT>好  查查看  我去跟卡米尔聊聊
<7-25,BECKETT>All right, run it. I'll talk to Camille.

195
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,930
<8-1,CAMILLE ROBERTS>简直像场噩梦  真不敢相信他死了
<8-1,CAMILLE ROBERTS>This is like a bad dream. I can't believe he's dead.

196
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,290
<8-2,BECKETT>为什么德里克一走
<8-2,BECKETT>Why did you leave the party

197
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,290
<8-2,BECKETT>你就紧跟着也离开了派对
<8-2,BECKETT>right after Derek did?

198
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,730
<8-3,CAMILLE ROBERTS>我待不下去了
<8-3,CAMILLE ROBERTS>I needed to get outta there.

199
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,440
<8-4,BECKETT>你去了哪里
<8-4,BECKETT>And where did you go?

200
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,630
<8-5,CAMILLE ROBERTS>我回家了  我只想一个人待着
<8-5,CAMILLE ROBERTS>Home. I just wanted to be alone.

201
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,770
<8-6,BECKETT>你离开之后没见过他
<8-6,BECKETT>You didn't see him afterwards?

202
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,080
<8-7,CAMILLE ROBERTS>我在街角转了个弯  他就不见了
<8-7,CAMILLE ROBERTS>I turned the corner, and he was gone.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,290
<8-7,CAMILLE ROBERTS>等等  你不会觉得我跟这事有关吧
<8-7,CAMILLE ROBERTS>Wait. You don't think I had something to do with this?

204
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,440
<8-8,BECKETT>卡米尔  他申请过对你的禁令
<8-8,BECKETT>Camille, he had a restraining order against you.

205
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,860
<8-9,CAMILLE ROBERTS>那事几年前的事了  只是个误会
<8-9,CAMILLE ROBERTS>That was years ago. It was just a big misunderstanding.

206
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,310
<8-9,CAMILLE ROBERTS>听着  德里克的确伤过我的心
<8-9,CAMILLE ROBERTS>Look, Derek broke my heart,

207
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,310
<8-9,CAMILLE ROBERTS>可我已经想通了
<8-9,CAMILLE ROBERTS>but then I got over it.

208
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,330
<8-10,BECKETT>这表情可不像已经想通了
<8-10,BECKETT>This... doesn't look like the face of a person who got over it.

209
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,010
<8-11,CAMILLE ROBERTS>当他走进派对
<8-11,CAMILLE ROBERTS>When he walked into the party

210
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,210
<8-11,CAMILLE ROBERTS>开始脱衣服  我的确很不爽
<8-11,CAMILLE ROBERTS>and started ripping his clothes off, it upset me,

211
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,460
<8-11,CAMILLE ROBERTS>可我没杀他
<8-11,CAMILLE ROBERTS>But I didn't kill him.

212
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
<8-12,BECKETT>好吧  不如咱们来整理一下事实
<8-12,BECKETT>Okay. Why don't we just go over the facts?

213
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,840
<8-12,BECKETT>你跟德里克有过一段不稳定的感情
<8-12,BECKETT>You had a volatile relationship with him,

214
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,840
<8-12,BECKETT>你和他在同一时间离开公寓
<8-12,BECKETT>you left the party the same time that Derek left.

215
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,620
<8-12,BECKETT>接着就有人发现了他的尸体
<8-12,BECKETT>And then he turned up dead.

216
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,910
<8-12,BECKETT>你还是直接告诉我到底发生了什么吧
<8-12,BECKETT>So why don't you just tell me what was really going on?

217
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,230
<8-13,CAMILLE ROBERTS>什么也没发生
<8-13,CAMILLE ROBERTS>Nothing.

218
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,230
<8-13,CAMILLE ROBERTS>我只是无法相信他当了脱衣舞男
<8-13,CAMILLE ROBERTS>I just couldn't believe he was stripping.

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,390
<8-14,BECKETT>为何这么吃惊
<8-14,BECKETT>And why was that a shock to you?

220
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,390
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>我们是在表演课上认识的
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>We met in acting class.

221
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,240
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>当时所有人都认为他会大红大紫
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>He was the one everyone thought was gonna hit it big.

222
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,950
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>当我质问他为什么要放弃梦想时
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>When I confronted him about giving up on his dream,

223
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,450
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>他说他跳脱衣舞
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>he said he was stripping

224
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,140
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>是因为急需用钱
<8-15,CAMILLE ROBERTS>because he was so desperate for money.

225
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,280
<8-16,BECKETT>他告诉你为什么了吗
<8-16,BECKETT>Did he tell you why?

226
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,980
<8-17,CAMILLE ROBERTS>他接了另一个表演
<8-17,CAMILLE ROBERTS>He had some other recurring gig,

227
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,690
<8-17,CAMILLE ROBERTS>可他说他必须退出  因为那会要了他的命
<8-17,CAMILLE ROBERTS>but... he said he had to quit 'cause it was gonna kill him.

228
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,480
<9-1,BECKETT>-直觉告诉我不是她  -同感
<9-1,BECKETT>- My instinct says it's not her.  - Mine, too.

229
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,940
<9-2,MONTGOMERY>但还是让鉴证组给她的衣服
<9-2,MONTGOMERY>But have C.S.U. check the clothes she was wearing

230
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,350
<9-2,MONTGOMERY>做个火药残余测试
<9-2,MONTGOMERY>for gunshot residue.

231
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,490
<9-3,BECKETT>明白  他跟卡米尔说的那个表演
<9-3,BECKETT>All right.  Any luck tracking down the gig

232
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,490
<9-3,BECKETT>有线索了吗
<9-3,BECKETT>that he was telling camille about?

233
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,760
<9-4,ESPOSITO>德里克有一个廉价的经纪人
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Derek has a low-rent theatrical agent,

234
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,430
<9-4,ESPOSITO>声称已经一年多没给他接过任何活动了
<9-4,ESPOSITO>says he hasn't booked anything in over a year.

235
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,460
<9-5,RYAN>他发邮件寄来了德里克的表演录影带
<9-5,RYAN>He just e-mailed Derek's acting reel.

236
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,130
<9-5,RYAN>能看出他的"远大"前途
<9-5,RYAN>Here's a taste of his illustrious career.

237
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,590
<9-6,ACTRESS>你们好  我只是随机采访几对情侣
<9-6,ACTRESS>Hey, there. I'm just stopping a few couples

238
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,330
<9-6,ACTRESS>看他们是否听说过一种叫做"聚能王"的产品
<9-6,ACTRESS>to see if they've ever heard of a product called Prolong.

239
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,140
<9-7,DEREK BROOKNER>开什么玩笑  我们刚开始服用聚能王
<9-7,DEREK BROOKNER>Are you kidding? We just started using prolong.

240
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,010

<9-10,MONTGOMERY>如果任何人有这个危险罪犯的消息
<9-10,MONTGOMERY>If you or anyone has any information on this dangerous criminal,

251
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,060
<9-10,MONTGOMERY>靠  我明白这家伙为啥要以脱衣为生了
<9-10,MONTGOMERY>Damn. I could see why the guy had to strip to pay his bills.

252
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,920
<9-11,BECKETT>我想  可以肯定地说
<9-11,BECKETT>Well, I guess it's safe to say

253
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,620
<9-11,BECKETT>他跟卡米尔提过的那个表演
<9-11,BECKETT>that the gig that he was telling Camille about

254
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,420
<9-11,BECKETT>肯定跟他的演艺事业无关
<9-11,BECKETT>Had nothing to do with his acting pursuits,

255
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,310
<9-11,BECKETT>总之  你俩去调查"纯爷们儿"经纪公司
<9-11,BECKETT>So you guys head off to mucho men.

256
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,150
<9-13,BECKETT>他的单身女郎派对表演就是那里接的
<9-13,BECKETT>That's the place that booked him for the bachelorette party.

257
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,590
<9-13,BECKETT>看他是否有定期的脱衣舞表演工作
<9-13,BECKETT>See if he had any regular stripping gigs...

258
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,610
<9-13,BECKETT>或有没有什么麻烦  我是贝克特
<9-13,BECKETT>or troubles there. Beckett.

259
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,400
<10-1,CASTLE>他也不算很帅嘛
<10-1,CASTLE>He's not that handsome.

260
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,450
<10-1,CASTLE>想知道我的意见吗  300块一小时
<10-1,CASTLE>You want my opinion? 300 bucks an hour--

261
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:52,930
<10-1,CASTLE>有点抬举他了
<10-1,CASTLE>Little steep.

262
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,090
<10-2,LANIE>作为这里欣赏过
<10-2,LANIE>As the person in this room

263
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,020
<10-2,LANIE>这张被单下全部内容的人  我觉得还该加价
<10-2,LANIE>that's seen everything under the sheet... bargain.

264
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,070
<10-3,BECKETT>还有什么发现
<10-3,BECKETT>What else did you find?

265
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,560
<10-4,LANIE>来看看吧
<10-4,LANIE>Take a look.

266
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,690
<10-5,BECKETT>一根头发
<10-5,BECKETT>A hair?

267
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,330
<10-6,LANIE>被害人最近把头发染成了灰白色
<10-6,LANIE>Your vic has hair that's been recently dyed gray.

268
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,900
<10-6,LANIE>看起来是一次性的
<10-6,LANIE>Looks like temporary hair dye

269
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,730
<10-6,LANIE>还没完全冲洗干净
<10-6,LANIE>that hasn't completely washed out yet.

270
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,620
<10-7,BECKETT>可大多数男人染发是为了掩盖白发啊
<10-7,BECKETT>Well, most men color their hair to cover the gray.

271
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,720
<10-8,CASTLE>有的女人喜欢制服诱惑
<10-8,CASTLE>Well, some women want officer mcnaughty,

272
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,570
<10-8,CASTLE>有的则喜欢体贴周到的老男人
<10-8,CASTLE>and some want an older guy who knows mutual funds.

273
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,630
<10-8,CASTLE>你懂的  恋父情结
<10-8,CASTLE>You know, daddy issues.

274
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,050
<10-9,BECKETT>他染发更像是为了试镜吧
<10-9,BECKETT>It's more likely he was coloring it for an audition.

275
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,610
<10-10,LANIE>说到头发  这有根更重要的头发
<10-10,LANIE>Speaking of hair, this is the more important hair

276
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,230
<10-10,LANIE>是我在被害人衣物上找到的
<10-10,LANIE>That I found on your vic's clothing.

277
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,870
<10-10,LANIE>很有可能是凶手的
<10-10,LANIE>That could belong to our killer.

278
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,830
<10-10,LANIE>金色长发
<10-10,LANIE>A long, blonde hair.

279
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,000
<10-11,BECKETT>有可能是
<10-11,BECKETT>Well, this could've come

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,990
<10-11,BECKETT>单身派对上的某个女人
<10-11,BECKETT>from one of the women at the bachelorette party.

281
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,210
<10-12,LANIE>起初我也这么想  所以我送去做了化验
<10-12,LANIE>That's what I thought until I had it tested.

282
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,150
<10-12,LANIE>结果发现了睾丸素
<10-12,LANIE>Came back positive for testosterone

283
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,130
<10-12,LANIE>和合成类固醇成分
<10-12,LANIE>and anabolic steroids.

284

<11-10,RYAN>他被谋杀了

<11-11,LLOYD SAUNDERS>真可惜  他是我的头牌之一
<11-11,LLOYD SAUNDERS>Wow. Derek was one of my best guys.

309
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,750
<11-12,RYAN>我们认为他可能接受了一项工作
<11-12,RYAN>We think he took a job

310
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,750
<11-12,RYAN>把他卷入了麻烦
<11-12,RYAN>that might have got him into trouble.

<11-12,RYAN>上个月你为他预订过什么工作
<11-12,RYAN>What kind of work did you book for him in the last month?

<11-13,LLOYD SAUNDERS>除此之外  就是些单身女郎派对
<11-13,LLOYD SAUNDERS>Other than that, it was all, uh, bachelorette

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,270
<11-13,LLOYD SAUNDERS>吵闹的生日派对之类的了

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,800
<11-14,ESPOSITO>男人的聚会呢
<11-14,ESPOSITO>What about any male parties?

317
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,310
<11-15,LLOYD SAUNDERS>没有  德里克只为女顾客服务
<11-15,LLOYD SAUNDERS>Nah. Derek was a women-only guy.

318
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,350
<11-16,RYAN>被杀那晚  他跟一个金发男人
<11-16,RYAN>He had contact with a blond-haired man

319
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,080
<11-16,RYAN>有过联系  那人曾服用过类固醇
<11-16,RYAN>who was on steroids the night he was killed.

320
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,360
<11-16,RYAN>能想起来可能是谁吗
<11-16,RYAN>Any idea who that might be?

321
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,720
<11-17,LLOYD SAUNDERS>可能是他另一份工作认识的人
<11-17,LLOYD SAUNDERS>It could've been someone at his other job.

322
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,990
<11-18,ESPOSITO>什么另一份工作
<11-18,ESPOSITO>What other job?

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,090
<11-19,LLOYD SAUNDERS>除了参加私人活动  他每周还有几晚
<11-19,LLOYD SAUNDERS>In addition to the private gigs, he also danced at a club

324
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,230
<11-19,LLOYD SAUNDERS>要在一家叫做"庞然大物"的俱乐部跳舞
<11-19,LLOYD SAUNDERS>called the package store a couple nights a week.

325
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,000
<11-19,LLOYD SAUNDERS>那里的大部分男人都油光可鉴
<11-19,LLOYD SAUNDERS>Most of those guys are juicing.

326
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
<11-20,RYAN>有谁跟他关系不好吗
<11-20,RYAN>Anyone he didn't get along with?

327
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,080
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>人们都以为女人才爱搬弄是非
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>People think women are catty,

328
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>可据德里克所说
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>but, uh, from what Derek said,

329
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,890
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>那些男人的争斗会让《艳舞女郎》
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>Those guys would make "Showgirls"

330
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,350
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>显得就像是课余活动
<11-21,LLOYD SAUNDERS>look like an after-school special.

331
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,630
<11-22,RYAN>谢谢
<11-22,RYAN>Thanks for your time.

332
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,780
<11-23,LLOYD SAUNDERS>要是你改变了主意的话
<11-23,LLOYD SAUNDERS>Hey, if, uh, you change your mind,

333
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,570
<11-23,LLOYD SAUNDERS>我可以提供尖牙和发胶
<11-23,LLOYD SAUNDERS>I'll provide fangs and some hair gel.

335
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,350
<12-1,MUCHO MAN>喜欢我性感的肌肉吗
<12-1,MUCHO MAN>You like my sexy abs?

336
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,520
<12-1,MUCHO MAN>到"庞然大物"来见我吧
<12-1,MUCHO MAN>Come see me at the package store...

337
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,830
<12-2,ESPOSITO>他们全都油得能榨出汁来
<12-2,ESPOSITO>All of 'em are buff enough to be juicing,

338
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,690
<12-2,ESPOSITO>可没有一个是长发
<12-2,ESPOSITO>but none of 'em have long hair.

339
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,210
<12-3,CASTLE>更别说金色长发了
<12-3,CASTLE>Certainly not long blond hair.

340
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,160
<12-4,BECKETT>也许这些是以前的照片
<12-4,BECKETT>Well, maybe these are old photos.

341
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,430
<12-5,RYAN>有可能他们根据最新的趋势改换了造型
<12-5,RYAN>It's possible they change their style based on the latest trend.

342
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,430
<12-5,RYAN>那个经纪人提起过
<12-5,RYAN>The booking agent mentioned

343
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,920
<12-5,RYAN>《暮光之城》的造型现在是主流
<12-5,RYAN>the "Twilight" Look is big right now.

345
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,690
<12-5,RYAN>也许法比奥的造型要卷土重来了
<12-5,RYAN>Maybe the Fabio look's making a comeback.

346
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,580
<12-6,BECKETT>只有一个办法能查清了
<12-6,BECKETT>Well, there's one surefire way to find out.

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,150
<12-6,BECKETT>嗷  卡塞尔
<12-6,BECKETT>Oh, Castle.

348
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,500
<13-1,CASTLE>真不敢相信你精心打扮了来这种场合
<13-1,CASTLE>I can't believe you got dressed up for this.

349
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,640
<13-1,CASTLE>我再问一次
<13-1,CASTLE>Tell me again

350
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,270
<13-1,CASTLE>为啥不让莱恩和埃斯波西托陪你来
<13-1,CASTLE>why Ryan and Esposito couldn't come with you?

351
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,120
<13-2,BECKETT>我们一致同意  作为自愿的凶杀警探志愿者
<13-2,BECKETT>We all agreed, as volunteer assistant homicide detective,

352
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,350
<13-2,BECKETT>只有你能真正的放下身段
<13-2,BECKETT>you could really sink your teeth

353
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,350
<13-2,BECKETT>投入到这种地方来进行调查
<13-2,BECKETT>into this avenue of investigation.

354
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,070
<13-2,BECKETT>还因为他俩都说"没门儿"
<13-2,BECKETT>And they called "Not it."

355
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,690
<13-3,CASTLE>知道吗  自从我跟着你办案以来
<13-3,CASTLE>You know, ever since I've been following you,

356
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,660
<13-3,CASTLE>我一直都在梦想有一天你会说
<13-3,CASTLE>I've been dreaming of the day that you'd say,

357
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,660
<13-3,CASTLE>咱们去脱衣舞俱乐部捉拿那个坏蛋吧
<13-3,CASTLE>"Let's go to the strip club and get this dirtbag."

358
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,920
<13-3,CASTLE>可我从没想过会是这种感觉
<13-3,CASTLE>I just never imagined it would feel like this.

359
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,430
<13-4,BECKETT>需要一美元钞票就告诉我一声
<13-4,BECKETT>Let me know if you need any singles.

360
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
<13-4,BECKETT>真悲剧啊  不远万里跑进城来
<13-4,BECKETT>It's sad, really. Guy comes to town

361
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,400
<14-1,RYAN>想寻找人生的重大转机
<14-1,RYAN>Looking for his big break,

362
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,830
<14-1,RYAN>梦想着在纽约过上光鲜的生活
<14-1,RYAN>Dreams of making it in the apple.

363
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,110
<14-1,RYAN>费了这么大劲  可最后得到了什么
<14-1,RYAN>What does he get for his trouble?

364
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,650
<14-1,RYAN>城市把他嚼烂又吐了出来
<14-1,RYAN>The city chews him up and spits him out.

365
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,710
<14-2,ESPOSITO>不公平啊  伙计
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Doesn't seem right, man.

<14-2,ESPOSITO>说得对  当然不公平
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Damn right, it doesn't seem right.

367
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,660
<14-3,RYAN>我想  他要的只是一点尊重
<14-3,RYAN>You know, all I think he wanted was a little respect.

368
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,740
<14-4,ESPOSITO>一切都是为了赢得尊重  伙计
<14-4,ESPOSITO>It's all about respect, bro.

<14-5,RYAN>只是想收支平衡
<14-5,RYAN>Just trying to make ends meet,

370
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,590
<14-5,RYAN>结果却死在楼梯上
<14-5,RYAN>he ends up face down in a stairwell...

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,110
<14-7,RYAN>穿着丁字裤
<14-7,RYAN>wearing a g-string.

<15-4,BECKETT>我刚刚和其中一位酒保谈过
<15-4,BECKETT>So listen, I just talked to one of the bartenders,

394
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,520
<15-4,BECKETT>其说辞与演出代理人一致
<15-4,BECKETT>who confirms the booking agent's story

395
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,930
<15-4,BECKETT>德里克的确和其中一名舞者关系闹得很僵
<15-4,BECKETT>that Derek was having troubles with one of the other dancers.

396
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,230
<15-4,BECKETT>情况是  一个叫做汉斯的人
<15-4,BECKETT>Apparently some guy named Hans was upset

397
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,540
<15-4,BECKETT>对于德里克抢了头牌的位置而怀恨在心
<15-4,BECKETT>that Derek was getting the headliner shift.

398
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,680
<15-4,BECKETT>他有动机  还有不利证据指向他
<15-4,BECKETT>That gives us evidence and motive.

399
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,540
<15-5,CASTLE>我们去后台  去找那个汉斯
<15-5,CASTLE>Let's go backstage. Grab us some hans.

<15-7,CASTLE>Firemen, really?

403
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,240
<15-7,CASTLE>太老套了吧
<15-7,CASTLE>That's not a little cliche?

404
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,050
<15-7,CASTLE>老天啊
<15-7,CASTLE>Oh, god.

405
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,210
<15-7,CASTLE>这些家伙没看过日光浴容易导致皮肤癌
<15-7,CASTLE>Haven't these guys got the memo about the correlation between

<15-8,BECKETT>-的备忘录吗  -你就好好享受嘛  卡塞尔
<15-8,BECKETT>- suntanning and skin cancer? - Can you just relax, castle?

407
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,910
<15-8,BECKETT>我们得搞清楚哪个是汉斯
<15-8,BECKETT>We gotta figure out which one is Hans.

408
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,540
<15-9,BECKETT>搞清楚了

<15-12,BECKETT>- Uh-huh. - No, no. Not you. Just Hans.

<15-12,BECKETT>伙计们  别扭了  我是警察  真的警察
<15-12,BECKETT>Guys, knock it off, okay. I'm a cop. A real cop.

<15-12,BECKETT>这样一点都不好玩  都冷静点
<15-12,BECKETT>Look, it's not funny. Now cool it.

414
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,030
<15-13,CASTLE>做的过火了吗
<15-13,CASTLE>Too much?

415
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,300
<15-13,CASTLE>德里克...是个小贱人
<15-13,CASTLE>Derek... was a little bitch.

416
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,010
<16-1,HANS>你知道他花多长时间
<16-1,HANS>Do you know how many hours he spent rehearsing

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,060
<16-1,HANS>他总是扯淡说
<16-1,HANS>He was all artsy-fartsy

420
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,820
<16-1,HANS>他要参加试镜或是话剧要排练什么的
<16-1,HANS>with his acting auditions this and play rehearsals that.

421
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,560
<16-2,CASTLE>汉斯·范曼斯沙夫特才是那个
<16-2,CASTLE>Hans Von Mannschaft is the one

423
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,440
<16-1,HANS>每晚都在认真干活的人
<16-1,HANS>doing the real work out there every night.

424
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,180
<16-2,CASTLE>汉斯·范曼斯沙夫特
<16-2,CASTLE>Hans Von Mannschaft?

425
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,510
<16-2,CASTLE>你这个艺名真赞啊
<16-2,CASTLE>That's a hell of a stage name.

426
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,660
<16-3,HANS>我告诉你  我可是骄傲的
<16-3,HANS>I'll have you know I come from a long line

427
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,900
<16-3,HANS>范曼斯沙夫特后裔
<16-3,HANS>of proud Von Mannschafts.

428
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,640
<16-4,BECKETT>你的祖先有过因谋杀进监狱的先例吗
<16-4,BECKETT>And have any of them served time for murder?

429
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,900
<16-5,HANS>等等  等等  谋杀
<16-5,HANS>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Murder?

430
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,780
<16-6,CASTLE>小心  汉斯  露出自己的新泽西口音了
<16-6,CASTLE>Careful, Hans. Your New Jersey is starting to show.

431
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,930
<16-7,HANS>这个地方给人梦幻的感觉
<16-7,HANS>This place is about fantasy.

432
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,340
<16-7,HANS>女人来这是为了解脱
<16-7,HANS>Women come here to escape.

433
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,080
<16-7,HANS>我这是为了表演
<16-7,HANS>This is part of the act.

434
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,360
<16-8,BECKETT>表演包括除掉竞争对手吗
<16-8,BECKETT>Does that include getting rid of the competition?

435
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,100
<16-8,BECKETT>德里克于昨晚被枪杀
<16-8,BECKETT>Derek was found shot and killed last night,

436
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,770
<16-8,BECKETT>我们在他的衣服上找到了你的头发
<16-8,BECKETT>and we found one of your hairs on his clothes.

437
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,110
<16-8,BECKETT>你刚刚也承认了你们不和
<16-8,BECKETT>And you just admitted that the two of you were rivals.

438
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,200
<16-9,HANS>不和  女士  我成天
<16-9,HANS>Rivals? Lady, I spend my days

439
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,840
<16-9,HANS>穿着小裤衩取悦女人
<16-9,HANS>with women shoving bills down my shorts.

440
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,470
<16-9,HANS>你真的认为我会因为关系不和就杀人吗
<16-9,HANS>Do you really think I'd kill somebody over that?

441
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,920
<16-10,CASTLE>这也改变不了现实  我们判定
<16-10,CASTLE>That doesn't change the fact, we can place you

442
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,950
<16-10,CASTLE>-你去过犯罪现场  -就因为发现我的头发吗
<16-10,CASTLE>- at the scene of the crime. - Because of my hair?

443
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,390
<16-11,HANS>那只能证明我们的服装
<16-11,HANS>All that proves is that we keep our costumes

444
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,680
<16-11,HANS>都装在一个大衣柜里面
<16-11,HANS>in the same big closet backstage.

445
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,250
<16-11,HANS>见鬼  我每天涂两次米诺地尔[防脱产品]
<16-11,HANS>Hell, I'm using minoxidil twice a day

446
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,620
<16-12,BECKETT>-就是为了别掉头发  -昨晚你在哪
<16-12,BECKETT>- just to keep it on my head. - Where were you last night?

447
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,850
<16-13,HANS>我在台上表演  从晚八点一直到凌晨一点
<16-13,HANS>I was onstage doing shows from 8:00 till 1:00.

448
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,500
<16-13,HANS>有100多个女人可以为我作证
<16-13,HANS>There are over 100 women who witnessed it.

449
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,180
<16-14,CASTLE>他的不在场证明和他的腹肌一样"结实"
<16-14,CASTLE>His alibi is as hard as his abs.

450
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,910
<16-15,HANS>你们和他的女友谈过吗
<16-15,HANS>Did you talk to his girlfriend?

451
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,690
<16-16,CASTLE>什么女友
<16-16,CASTLE>What girlfriend?

452
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,070
<16-17,HANS>一个很是喜欢他的富婆
<16-17,HANS>Some rich cougar who was obsessed with him.

453
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,590
<16-17,HANS>很显然德里克是为了钱才和她在一起的
<16-17,HANS>It was obvious Derek was using her for the money,

454
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,790
<16-17,HANS>但是我想可能是他受够了她  便抛弃了她
<16-17,HANS>But I guess he got fed up with her and kicked her to the curb.

455
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,350
<16-18,CASTLE>-你怎么知道的  -她总是
<16-18,CASTLE>- How do you know that? - She always

456
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,550
<16-19,HANS>把很贵的花送到他的更衣室
<16-19,HANS>sent expensive bouquets to his dressing room.

457
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,120
<16-19,HANS>但是上周
<16-19,HANS>and then last week,

458
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,760
<16-19,HANS>这个月的头一回  没有花了
<16-19,HANS>for the first time in months, no flowers.

459
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,030
<17-1,ESPOSITO>嘿  什么情况  没有一美元的钞票了吗
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, what's up? You run outta singles?

460
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,940
<17-2,RYAN>汉斯说得对  我们找到一个花店
<17-2,RYAN>Hey, Hans was right. We found a flower shop that confirmed

461
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,290
<17-2,RYAN>确认过去四个月每周都有送花去
<17-2,RYAN>weekly deliveries for the past four months.

462
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,190
<17-3,CASTLE>我就知道询问那个范曼斯沙夫特  会找到线索的

496
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,120
<17-11,BECKETT>才是解决问题的最好方法
<17-11,BECKETT>if we just ask Rebecca a few questions tomorrow morning.

497
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,300
<17-13,RYAN>-但是故事很精彩吧  -是啊  我喜欢
<17-13,RYAN>- It was good, though, right? - Yeah, I liked it.

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,180
<18-3,ALEXIS>我倒是希望如此  我和凯莉·伯顿
<18-3,ALEXIS>I wish. They narrowed the part of Sandy

<18-3,ALEXIS>成为了扮演珊迪的最后候选人
<18-3,ALEXIS>down to Kelly Burton and yours truly.

505
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,430
<18-4,MARTHA>所以我们才穿着戏服练台词
<18-4,MARTHA>That's why we're running lines in costume.

506
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,210
<18-4,MARTHA>明天你会很自然的发挥的
<18-4,MARTHA>Tomorrow it'll be second nature.

<18-5,CASTLE>我看出来了  你到你的时间胶囊里
<18-5,CASTLE>Well, I see you've dug up your time capsule

<18-5,CASTLE>-找回了你的裤子  -我告诉你
<18-5,CASTLE>- to resurrect those pants. - I will have you know,

<18-6,MARTHA>I had some of my best memories happen in these pants.

<18-7,CASTLE>-恶心  -恰恰恰
<18-7,CASTLE>- And ew. - Cha.

<18-8,ALEXIS>我去睡觉了  明天是大日子
<18-8,ALEXIS>I'm off to bed. Big day tomorrow.

<18-9,MARTHA>-好的  亲爱的  好梦  -谢谢
<18-9,MARTHA>- Okay, darling. Sleep well. - Thank you.

<18-9,MARTHA>不管怎样  我都为她感到骄傲
<18-9,MARTHA>Whatever happens, I am so proud of her.

514
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,920
<18-9,MARTHA>她无所畏惧
<18-9,MARTHA>She is fearless.

515
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,400
<18-10,CASTLE>知道吗  老妈
<18-10,CASTLE>You know, mother,

516
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,320
<18-10,CASTLE>我觉得你给阿丽克西斯做了好榜样
<18-10,CASTLE>I think you're a really good influence on Alexis.

517
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,510
<18-11,MARTHA>怎么回事  孩子  发烧了还是精神错乱了
<18-11,MARTHA>What's with you, kiddo? Fever, delirium?

518
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,620
<18-12,CASTLE>不不不  我说真的呢
<18-12,CASTLE>No, no, no, I'm serious.

519
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,990
<18-12,CASTLE>你总是...很专注
<18-12,CASTLE>You have always been... dedicated,

520
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
<18-12,CASTLE>这种坚持很难做到的
<18-12,CASTLE>and that--that can't have been easy.

521
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,010
<18-13,MARTHA>我也不是一路顺风顺水啊
<18-13,MARTHA>Well, yeah, it hasn't always been days of wine and roses.

522
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,470
<18-13,MARTHA>我也做过那些见不得人的工作
<18-13,MARTHA>I had to take a lot of less-than-prestigious jobs

523
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,850
<18-13,MARTHA>-来支撑自己的演艺事业  -比如说
<18-13,MARTHA>- to ply my craft. - Such as?

524
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,990
<18-15,MARTHA>上帝啊  我演过小精灵
<18-15,MARTHA>Oh, lord. I played an elf. Ugh.

525
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,340
<18-15,MARTHA>那是在圣诞老人小村  还扮过自由女神像
<18-15,MARTHA>Santa's Village. Uh, lady liberty.

526
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,840
<18-15,MARTHA>在一个税务中心外面扮自由女神像
<18-15,MARTHA>Lady liberty outside some low-rent tax service,

527
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,240
<18-15,MARTHA>还有就是  哦不
<18-15,MARTHA>and then--oh, no.

528
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,790
<18-15,MARTHA>最烂的工作  我做过最烂的工作
<18-15,MARTHA>The worst job-- the worst job I ever had--

529
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,100
<18-15,MARTHA>我完全做不好  他们也不喜欢我  真是...
<18-15,MARTHA>I was terrible at it, they hated me, it just--

530
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,740
<18-15,MARTHA>我...那真是...简直是
<18-15,MARTHA>I was--it was absolutely the--just completely--

531
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,570
<18-16,CASTLE>什么工作
<18-16,CASTLE>What was it?

532
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,550
<18-17,MARTHA>做秘书
<18-17,MARTHA>Secretary.

533
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,860
<18-18,CASTLE>那活儿你做不来的
<18-18,CASTLE>You'd be terrible at that.

534
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,370
<18-19,MARTHA>太烂了
<18-19,MARTHA>Awful.

535
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,030
<19-1,CASTLE>我确定很多美男都走过这个大厅
<19-1,CASTLE>Oh, I'm sure many a pretty boy have walked this hall.

536
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,220
<19-1,CASTLE>用不了多久  他们就会发现
<19-1,CASTLE>Doesn't take 'em long to realize that they're trapped

537
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,600
<19-1,CASTLE>他们落入了一个中年熟女设下的陷阱
<19-1,CASTLE>in the strangling embrace of an aging spinster.

538
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,870
<19-2,BECKETT>我们还是先和她谈谈
<19-2,BECKETT>Maybe we should talk with her

539
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,260
<19-2,BECKETT>你再开始写电影剧本吧
<19-2,BECKETT>before you start writing the lifetime movie.

540
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,570
<19-3,CASTLE>嘿  快速选择演员阵容  艾什顿和黛米
<19-3,CASTLE>Ooh. Quick casting idea-- Ashton and Demi.

542
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,710
<19-4,BECKETT>纽约警局  我们来找瑞贝卡·达顿
<19-4,BECKETT>NYPD. We're here to speak with Rebecca Dalton.

543
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,630
<19-5,MICHAEL GRANT>请进
<19-5,MICHAEL GRANT>Please come in.

544
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,460
<19-5,MICHAEL GRANT>我是达顿女士的律师  迈克尔·格兰特
<19-5,MICHAEL GRANT>I'm Ms. Dalton's attorney, Michael Grant.

545
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,250
<19-5,MICHAEL GRANT>我会在询问中旁听
<19-5,MICHAEL GRANT>I'll be sitting in on the interview.

546
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,320
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>我在一次筹款活动中认识了德里克
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>I bumped into Derek at a fund-raiser.

547
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,910
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>后来他承认是主办方请他来
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>He later admitted that he had been hired by the host

548
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,770
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>施展魅力  促使人们在缄默拍卖中竞价
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>to mingle and encourage people to bid on the silent auction.

549
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,560
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>但是为时已晚  我已经喜欢上了他
<20-1,REBECCA DALTON>But it was too late. I already liked him.

550
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,010
<20-2,CASTLE>你发现他是脱衣舞者反应如何
<20-2,CASTLE>And when you found out he was a stripper?

551
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,640
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>我没有发现  是他告诉我的
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>I never found out. He told me.

552
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,430
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>这种事他不会瞒着我的
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>He never hid any of that from me.

553
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,920
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>这工作使得他早上可以去搞他的演艺事业
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>It gave him the freedom to pursue his acting career,

554
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,370
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>可以在白天去试镜  他的坚韧值得我尊敬
<20-3,REBECCA DALTON>audition during the day, and I respected his tenacity.

555
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,190
<20-4,BECKETT>因为什么分手了
<20-4,BECKETT>What caused the breakup?

556
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,070
<20-5,REBECCA DALTON>关系自然而然走到了尽头
<20-5,REBECCA DALTON>The relationship had run its course.

557
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,130
<20-6,BECKETT>听起来像是在说谎
<20-6,BECKETT>That sounds like something that you would say

558
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,020
<20-6,BECKETT>尽管我不知道你是在骗我们  还是在骗自己
<20-6,BECKETT>when you're lying, either to yourself or to us.

559
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,340
<20-7,REBECCA DALTON>你不会是以为他的死和我有关吧
<20-7,REBECCA DALTON>You don't really think I had anything to do with his death?

560
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,090
<20-8,BECKETT>我只是觉得在你们分手后不久  他就遇害
<20-8,BECKETT>I just find it curious that right after you've split up,

561
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,920
<20-8,BECKETT>这一点很可疑
<20-8,BECKETT>he's found dead.

562
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,100
<20-9,CASTLE>谁提出的分手
<20-9,CASTLE>Who broke it off?

563
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,350
<20-10,MICHAEL GRANT>-我的委托人  -因为什么
<20-10,MICHAEL GRANT>- My client did. - Why?

564
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,360
<20-12,MICHAEL GRANT>上周  他管我的委托人借两万五千美元
<20-12,MICHAEL GRANT>Last week, he asked my client to borrow $25,000.

565
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,920
<20-13,REBECCA DALTON>我早就知道  把钱和情感混在一起
<20-13,REBECCA DALTON>I've learned, it's never a good idea

566
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,880
<20-13,REBECCA DALTON>可不是什么好主意
<20-13,REBECCA DALTON>to mix relationships with money.

567
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,080
<20-13,REBECCA DALTON>意图会变得模糊不清
<20-13,REBECCA DALTON>Intentions get foggy.

568
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,790
<20-14,BECKETT>-他为什么需要那笔钱  -他不肯说
<20-14,BECKETT>- And why did he need the money? - He wouldn't say.

569
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,220
<20-15,REBECCA DALTON>更糟的是  他显得很冷漠
<20-15,REBECCA DALTON>And to make matters worse, he seemed distant.

570
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,990
<20-16,CASTLE>你认为他出轨了
<20-16,CASTLE>You thought he was cheating.

571
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,450
<20-17,REBECCA DALTON>有过这个想法  不是什么值得炫耀的事
<20-17,REBECCA DALTON>It occurred to me, and I'm not proud of it,

572
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,620
<20-17,REBECCA DALTON>但是我请迈克尔雇了私家侦探
<20-17,REBECCA DALTON>but I had Michael hire a private investigator.

573
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,410
<20-17,REBECCA DALTON>我必须知道真相
<20-17,REBECCA DALTON>I had to know.

574
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,180
<20-18,MICHAEL GRANT>当我的委托人看到了照片  她意识到
<20-18,MICHAEL GRANT>When my client saw the photographs, she realized

575
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,170
<20-18,MICHAEL GRANT>德里克和一些声名狼藉的人混在一起
<20-18,MICHAEL GRANT>Derek was mixed up with some disreputable people.

576
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,380
<20-19,BECKETT>你为什么会觉得那是坏事
<20-19,BECKETT>And what made you think it was a bad element?

577
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,640
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>因为德里克不会和那种人有来往的
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>Because Derek didn't hang out with people like that.

578
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,550
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>他是来自密西根的好男孩
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>He was a good kid from Michigan.

579
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,490
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>如果他们跟谋杀案有任何关系
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>If they had something to do with his murder,

580
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,300
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>我会改变主意
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>I'd have taken my decision back

581
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,340
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>立马把钱借给他
<20-20,REBECCA DALTON>and given him the money in a heartbeat.

582
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,540
<20-21,BECKETT>我要看看那些照片
<20-21,BECKETT>I'm gonna need to see those photos.

583
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,510
<21-1,RYAN>私家侦探拍到
<21-1,RYAN>The P.I. took a picture

584
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,100
<21-1,RYAN>德里克跟这个女人说话
<21-1,RYAN>of Derek talking to this woman,

585
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,380
<21-1,RYAN>然后他跟这女的去了另一个地方
<21-1,RYAN>and then he followed her to the next location.

586
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,690
<21-2,CASTLE>那么德里克在家附近
<21-2,CASTLE>So Derek is outside his apartment

587
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,130
<21-2,CASTLE>跟"炸弹"麦吉说话
<21-2,CASTLE>talking to Bombshell Mcgee.

589
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,260
<21-2,CASTLE>-这有什么危险的吗  -等等
<21-2,CASTLE>-What's so dangerous about that? - Wait a minute.

590
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,980
<21-3,BECKETT>莱恩  你能将德里克的表演录像调出来吗
<21-3,BECKETT>Ryan, can you pull up Derek's acting reel?

591
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,220
<21-4,RYAN>天啊  看一次就够要命的了
<21-4,RYAN>Man, once was bad enough.

592
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,970
<21-5,DEREK BROOKNER>把你身上的钱都给我
<21-5,DEREK BROOKNER>Give me all your money and whatever parts

593
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,690
<21-6,BECKETT>还有那个车库里的所有东西
<21-6,BECKETT>you got out there in that garage,

594
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,270
<21-6,BECKETT>我就考虑不朝你脑袋开枪
<21-6,BECKETT>and I'll consider not puttin' one in your noggin'.

595
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,590
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>比利·格里姆是
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>Billy Grimm is the

596
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,050
<21-6,BECKETT>这跟照片上是同一个人
<21-6,BECKETT>That's the same guy as the mug shot.

597
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,640
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>比利·格里姆
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>Billy Grimm

598
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,910
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>西哥特机车族的老大
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>leader of the visigoths motorcycle gang.

599
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,310
<21-8,ESPOSITO>比利·格里姆的犯罪记录
<21-8,ESPOSITO>Billy Grimm's rap sheet.

600
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,920
<21-9,MONTGOMERY>勒索  用致命武器袭击他人  持械抢劫
<21-9,MONTGOMERY>Extortion, assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery.

601
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,640
<21-10,ESPOSITO>当德里克的那集
<21-10,ESPOSITO>When Derek's episode

602
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,990
<21-10,ESPOSITO>《全美最危险的罪犯》播出后
<21-10,ESPOSITO>of "America's most dangerous criminals" aired,

603
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,790
<21-10,ESPOSITO>格里姆被指控意图谋杀
<21-10,ESPOSITO>Grimm had an attempt murder warrant out.

604
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,760
<21-10,ESPOSITO>显然有人欠他钱  于是他将那人
<21-10,ESPOSITO>Apparently some guy owed him money, so he chained him

605
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,090
<21-10,ESPOSITO>绑在摩托车后面  拖上了长岛高速公路
<21-10,ESPOSITO>to the back of his bike and dragged him down the L.I.E.

606
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,900
<21-11,MONTGOMERY>变态格里姆怎么没关进牢里
<21-11,MONTGOMERY>Why isn't this psycho Grimm in jail?

607
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,760
<21-12,ESPOSITO>他进过了  事实上  他就是因为
<21-12,ESPOSITO>He was, as a matter of fact, he was caught

608
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,870
<21-12,ESPOSITO>德里克在节目中再次扮演他才被逮捕的
<21-12,ESPOSITO>because of Derek's reenactment on the show.

609
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,530
<21-12,ESPOSITO>但那个被绑住的家伙改变了主意
<21-12,ESPOSITO>But the guy he chained to his bike had a change of heart,

610
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,480
<21-12,ESPOSITO>决定不指控他  于是格里姆最近被释放了
<21-12,ESPOSITO>refused to testify, so Grimm was recently released from jail.

611
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,880
<21-13,BECKETT>如果这家伙做事这么疯狂
<21-13,BECKETT>Well, if this guy was such a whack job,

612
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,520
<21-13,BECKETT>那德里克为什么还要跟他的手下说话
<21-13,BECKETT>what was Derek doing talking to one of the members of his gang?

613
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,370
<21-14,RYAN>我知道答案  格里姆被捕时
<21-14,RYAN>I think I can answer that. When Grimm was arrested,

614
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,450
<21-14,RYAN>一名记者问他因为一个
<21-14,RYAN>a reporter asked him how he felt

615
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,270
<21-14,RYAN>电视节目而被捕有什么感觉
<21-14,RYAN>about being brought to justice by a TV show.

616
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,940
<21-14,RYAN>他发誓要报复那些令他进监狱的人
<21-14,RYAN>He swore vengeance against those who put him jail,

617
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,170
<21-14,RYAN>尤其是  格里姆说
<21-14,RYAN>especially--and Grimm says,

618
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,740
<21-14,RYAN>那个令我看起来像个小丑的演员
<21-14,RYAN>"that actor that made me look like a clown."

619
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,600
<21-15,ESPOSITO>我可以从以前特遣队的经验
<21-15,ESPOSITO>I can tell you this about visigoths

620
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,930
<21-15,ESPOSITO>告诉你  西哥特人
<21-15,ESPOSITO>from my gang task force days

621
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,550
<21-15,ESPOSITO>他们很注重自己的身份
<21-15,ESPOSITO>they're serious about their colors.

622
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,200
<21-15,ESPOSITO>这些背心上的补丁
<21-15,ESPOSITO>These patches they wear on their vests?

623
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,520
<21-15,ESPOSITO>不是校队制服上的字母
<21-15,ESPOSITO>They're not varsity letters.

624
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,210
<21-15,ESPOSITO>他们可是得付出血汗才能得到的
<21-15,ESPOSITO>They gotta spill blood to get 'em.

625
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,040
<21-15,ESPOSITO>但却有家伙穿着这个出现在电视上
<21-15,ESPOSITO>And some guy wearing 'em on national tv?

626
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,040
<21-16,BECKETT>那么她是在设计他
<21-16,BECKETT>So she was setting him up...

627
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,620
<21-16,BECKETT>为了谋杀他
<21-16,BECKETT>for murder.

628
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,150
<22-1,BECKETT>放松  卡塞尔  它被锁链绑着
<22-1,BECKETT>Relax, Castle. It's on a chain.

629
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,220
<22-1,BECKETT>纽约警局
<22-1,BECKETT>NYPD.

630
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,020
<22-2,VISIGOTH>这是你的老妈么
<22-2,VISIGOTH>This your old lady?

631
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,880
<22-3,BILLY GRIMM>这是私人机构
<22-3,BILLY GRIMM>This is a private establishment.

632
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,810
<22-4,BECKETT>那么我们将这事私密地处理
<22-4,BECKETT>Well, then we'll try to keep this private.

633
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,730
<22-4,BECKETT>比利·格里姆
<22-4,BECKETT>Billy Grimm.

634
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,260
<22-5,BILLY GRIMM>鲍比
<22-5,BILLY GRIMM>Bobby!

635
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,280
<22-5,BILLY GRIMM>唷
<22-5,BILLY GRIMM>Yo!

636
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,290
<22-6,BECKETT>我需要问你一些问题
<22-6,BECKETT>I need to ask you a few questions

637
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,320
<22-6,BECKETT>是关于你和德里克·博克纳的关系
<22-6,BECKETT>about your association with Derek Brookner.

638
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,950
<22-7,BILLY GRIMM>没听说过这家伙
<22-7,BILLY GRIMM>Never heard of the guy.

639
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,100
<22-8,BECKETT>我只要一通电话  管理机动车盗窃的部门
<22-8,BECKETT>I make one phone call, and auto theft detail is down here

640
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,420
<22-8,BECKETT>就会来查车辆识别号码
<22-8,BECKETT>checking vin numbers.

641
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,450
<22-8,BECKETT>他们只需要找到一个失窃的尾灯  你就玩完了
<22-8,BECKETT>They find so much as a stolen taillight, you're violated.

642
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,300
<22-8,BECKETT>你现在想起他了吗
<22-8,BECKETT>You remember him now?

643
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,500
<22-8,BECKETT>我想起来了
<22-8,BECKETT>You know, I do.

644
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,350
<22-9,BILLY GRIMM>他看起来像是好孩子
<22-9,BILLY GRIMM>He seemed like a good kid.

645
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,950
<22-10,BECKETT>他死了  我敢打赌你跟这事
<22-10,BECKETT>He's dead, and I'm willing to bet that you

646
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,480
<22-10,BECKETT>-脱不了干系  -德里克毁了你的形象
<22-10,BECKETT>- had something to do with it. - Derek wore the colors,

647
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,970
<22-11,CASTLE>而且你因为这节目被捕了
<22-11,CASTLE>and you got popped 'cause of the show.

648
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,880
<22-12,BECKETT>这就是为什么你找人干掉他
<22-12,BECKETT>That's why you put a contract out on him.

649
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,540
<22-13,BILLY GRIMM>我或许是有些恼火
<22-13,BILLY GRIMM>Well, I might have been a little pissed off.

650
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,050
<22-13,BILLY GRIMM>但这孩子懂得尊重别人
<22-13,BILLY GRIMM>But the kid came with respect.

651
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,000
<22-13,BILLY GRIMM>他带来了捐款
<22-13,BILLY GRIMM>He brought a donation.

652
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,270
<22-14,BECKETT>捐款  你是什么  救世军吗
<22-14,BECKETT>A donation? What are you, the Salvation Army?

653
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,440
<22-15,BILLY GRIMM>我也很惊讶  但我想德里克可能认为
<22-15,BILLY GRIMM>Well, I was surprised, too, but I guess Derek felt

654
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,020
<22-15,BILLY GRIMM>两万五千美金能帮助解决我的日常开支
<22-15,BILLY GRIMM>25 g's might help bring down my overhead.

655
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,640
<22-16,BECKETT>你真的觉得我会相信
<22-16,BECKETT>Do you really expect me to believe

656
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,490
<22-16,BECKETT>一个苦苦挣扎的演员能有足够的钱
<22-16,BECKETT>that a struggling actor had enough money

657
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,220
<22-16,BECKETT>捐献两万五千美金给你吗
<22-16,BECKETT>to give you 25 grand outta nowhere?

658
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,820
<22-17,BILLY GRIMM>这是事实
<22-17,BILLY GRIMM>That's what happened.

659
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,070
<22-18,CASTLE>他的钱从哪来的
<22-18,CASTLE>Where did he get the money?

660
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,440
<22-19,BILLY GRIMM>我又没看过他该死的纳税申报单
<22-19,BILLY GRIMM>I didn't ask to see his frigging tax return.

661
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,660
<22-19,BILLY GRIMM>他的钱从哪来并不关我的事
<22-19,BILLY GRIMM>Ain't my business how he got the money.

662
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,550
<22-19,BILLY GRIMM>他带给我现金  这就够了
<22-19,BILLY GRIMM>He brought the cash, and that was good enough.

663
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,440
<22-20,BECKETT>难道你忘记了勒索的那部分吗
<22-20,BECKETT>Aren't you forgetting the part about the extortion,

664
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,520
<22-20,BECKETT>你让你女友替你捎话
<22-20,BECKETT>the part where you asked your girlfriend to deliver a message

665
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,810
<22-20,BECKETT>叫德里克付你两万五千美金
<22-20,BECKETT>that Derek had to pay you 25 grand?

666
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,990
<22-20,BECKETT>你给他一周的期限去筹钱
<22-20,BECKETT>You gave him a week to do it.

667
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,510
<22-20,BECKETT>他没法筹到钱
<22-20,BECKETT>He couldn't scrape together the money,

668
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,720
<22-20,BECKETT>于是你杀了他
<22-20,BECKETT>and so you killed him.

669
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,790
<22-21,BILLY GRIMM>宝贝  这是怎么回事
<22-21,BILLY GRIMM>Babe, what is this?

670
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,740
<22-22,MANDY CARSON>我可以解释
<22-22,MANDY CARSON>I can explain.

671
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,020
<22-23,BILLY GRIMM>你干嘛跟这混蛋说话
<22-23,BILLY GRIMM>What the hell were you doing talking to that bitch?

672
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,250
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>听着  你出狱时
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>Listen, when you got outta jail,

673
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,470
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>我担心你会做出什么傻事
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>I got nervous you were gonna do something stupid,

674
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,940
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>所以我跟那孩子说  如果他不想惹麻烦
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>so I went to talk to the kid, told him if he didn't want

675
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,140
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>就先带钱来找你
<22-24,MANDY CARSON>any trouble, he'd bring you a preemptive donation.

676
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,410
<22-25,BILLY GRIMM>你警告他了  所以他才会出现吗
<22-25,BILLY GRIMM>So you warned him? That's why he showed up here?

677
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,430
<22-26,MANDY CARSON>我不能再次失去你
<22-26,MANDY CARSON>I couldn't stand the thought of losing you again.

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,890
<23-3,BECKETT>我想知道一个脱衣舞男怎么能这么快
<23-3,BECKETT>You know what I want to know is how a stripper comes up

687
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,230
<23-3,BECKETT>-筹到这么多钱的  -开个黄金户口
<23-3,BECKETT>- with that kind of cash in such a hurry? - Cash-n-gold.

688
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,450
<23-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看太多电视导购节目了
<23-5,BECKETT>Castle, you watch way too many infomercials.

689
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,980
<23-6,RYAN>我们也调查了他在JLP银行的户口
<23-6,RYAN>We also checked his account at JLP Bank Corp.

690
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,040
<23-6,RYAN>他的账户余款
<23-6,RYAN>He never carried an account balance

691
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,380
<23-6,RYAN>从没超过几千元
<23-6,RYAN>of more than a couple thousand dollars.

692
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,830
<23-7,CASTLE>等等  如果德里克在JLP银行有户口
<23-7,CASTLE>Wait a minute. If Derek had an account with JLP Bank Corp,

693
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,610
<23-7,CASTLE>为什么他的车里会有联邦堡垒的存款单
<23-7,CASTLE>why was there a deposit slip from Rampart Federal in his car?

694
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,280
<23-8,BECKETT>我们去查出德里克付比利钱的那天
<23-8,BECKETT>Let's run down withdrawals for 25 grand

695
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,430
<23-8,BECKETT>从联邦堡垒分行提取了
<23-8,BECKETT>from rampart federal branches

696
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,060
<23-8,BECKETT>两万五千美金的账户吧
<23-8,BECKETT>for the day that Derek paid Billy.

697
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,810
<23-9,RYAN>我不晓得你怎么会漏了这个
<23-9,RYAN>I don't know how you missed that.

698
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,930
<23-10,ESPOSITO>93街的联邦堡垒处理过同数额的交易
<23-10,ESPOSITO>Rampart federal on 93rd posted a transaction that size,

699
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,780
<23-10,ESPOSITO>由杰西·曼德勒在那天11点53分提取
<23-10,ESPOSITO>made by a Jesse Mandalay at 11:53 a.m. that day.

700
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,580
<23-11,RYAN>德里克的其中
<23-11,RYAN>Derek had a card

701
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,350
<23-11,RYAN>一本书里夹了杰西·曼德勒的名片
<23-11,RYAN>for Jesse Mandalay tucked inside one of his books.

702
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
<23-11,RYAN>我打了上面的电话  没能连接上
<23-11,RYAN>I called the number. It was disconnected.

703
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,120
<23-12,MONTGOMERY>有可能就是曼德勒
<23-12,MONTGOMERY>It's possible that Mandalay

704
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,560
<23-12,MONTGOMERY>借了钱给德里克
<23-12,MONTGOMERY>was the one that loaned Derek the money.

705
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,700
<23-13,CASTLE>或许德里克以为他可以弹性地还债
<23-13,CASTLE>Maybe Derek thought he was on a flexible payment plan,

706
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,800
<23-13,CASTLE>需要多点时间  于是曼德勒杀了他
<23-13,CASTLE>needed more time, and Mandalay killed him for it.

707
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,700
<23-14,ESPOSITO>银行现在正将曼德勒取款的监控录像
<23-14,ESPOSITO>Well, the bank is sending over the surveillance footage

<23-14,ESPOSITO>Here we go. There's Mandalay taking the cash.

710
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,210
<23-15,MONTGOMERY>没错  这西装看上去
<23-15,MONTGOMERY>Yeah, by the looks of that suit,

711
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,180
<23-15,MONTGOMERY>放高利贷的工作利润不错
<23-15,MONTGOMERY>the loan business must be pretty lucrative.

712
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,420
<23-15,MONTGOMERY>-好了  来看这家伙的脸  -等等等等
<23-15,MONTGOMERY>- Okay, let's see this guy's face. - Wait, wait, wait.

713
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,960
<23-16,BECKETT>那不是杰西·曼德勒
<23-16,BECKETT>That's not Jesse Mandalay.

714
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,110
<23-16,BECKETT>那是染了灰发的德里克
<23-16,BECKETT>That's Derek with gray hair.

715
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,420
<23-16,BECKETT>杰西·曼德勒就是德里克
<23-16,BECKETT>Jesse Mandalay is Derek.

716
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,130
<24-1,BECKETT>分行经理说德里克提款的户口
<24-1,BECKETT>The branch manager said that Derek withdrew money

717
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,110
<24-1,BECKETT>叫做太阳火有限公司
<24-1,BECKETT>from an account called Sunfire Limited.

718
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,940
<24-2,CASTLE>那他另一个身份杰西·曼德勒呢
<24-2,CASTLE>And his alter ego Jesse Mandalay?

719
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,480
<24-3,BECKETT>是签署者  但其他的仍然是一个谜
<24-3,BECKETT>Was the signatory, but the rest is a mystery.

720
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,200
<24-3,BECKETT>太阳火连接到一个海外帐户
<24-3,BECKETT>Sunfire is linked to an offshore account,

721
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,590
<24-3,BECKETT>他们唯一能追查到的人就是曼德勒了
<24-3,BECKETT>and the only person that they can trace it to is Mandalay.

722
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,830
<24-4,ESPOSITO>这些钱的踪迹引向到一个不存在的人
<24-4,ESPOSITO>A money trail that leads back to a man who doesn't exist.

723
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,330
<24-5,CASTLE>德里克染了头发
<24-5,CASTLE>Derek was dyeing his hair gray,

724
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,330
<24-5,CASTLE>穿上名贵西装让自己看起来很有成就
<24-5,CASTLE>wearing fancy suits to look more distinguished,

725
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,760
<24-5,CASTLE>而且他在看财经和投资的书籍
<24-5,CASTLE>and he was reading books on finance and investment

726
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,200
<24-5,CASTLE>是为了替某人饰演杰西·曼德勒的角色
<24-5,CASTLE>so that he could play the role of Jesse Mandalay for someone.

727
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,320
<24-6,ESPOSITO>但为什么要雇一个演员去饰演商人
<24-6,ESPOSITO>But why hire a struggling actor to play a businessman?

728
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,910
<24-7,CASTLE>我调查了些中国企业的资料
<24-7,CASTLE>I did some research on chinese companies that would,

729
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,200
<24-7,CASTLE>有时候会雇请白人
<24-7,CASTLE>uh, sometimes hire a-a white man

730
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,110
<24-7,CASTLE>去扮演主管参加剪彩仪式
<24-7,CASTLE>to pose as an executive at, uh, ribbon cutting ceremonies,

731
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,380
<24-7,CASTLE>股东大会
<24-7,CASTLE>uh, shareholder meetings,

732
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,710
<24-7,CASTLE>只是为了令投资者产生信心
<24-7,CASTLE>just to instill confidence in investors.

733
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,540
<24-7,CASTLE>同样  一个大学生寻求创业投资
<24-7,CASTLE>Likewise, a college student seeking Venture Capital

734
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,570
<24-7,CASTLE>有时候会雇请看起来成熟的骗子
<24-7,CASTLE>will sometimes hire an older-looking shill,

735
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,050
<24-7,CASTLE>你知道  有的人看起来比较杰出
<24-7,CASTLE>you know, someone who looks more, uh, distinguished

736
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,270
<24-7,CASTLE>去帮助他们筹集资金
<24-7,CASTLE>to help them secure money.

737
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,750
<24-8,BECKETT>如果德里克是被雇去当公司门面的
<24-8,BECKETT>So if Derek was hired to be the face of the company,

738
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,420
<24-8,BECKETT>那么不管是谁雇他
<24-8,BECKETT>then whoever hired him

739
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,500
<24-8,BECKETT>就是幕后操控银行户口的人
<24-8,BECKETT>was the person behind the bank account.

740
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,700
<24-8,BECKETT>我们追查最近
<24-8,BECKETT>Let's see if we can track down any checks

741
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,790
<24-8,BECKETT>存入太阳火有限公司的支票
<24-8,BECKETT>that were deposited into sunfire limited recently.

742
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,340
<24-8,BECKETT>如果我们能追踪到那些钱  或许我们就能
<24-8,BECKETT>If we can trace the money, maybe we can figure out

743
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,430
<24-8,BECKETT>弄清楚杰西·曼德勒这角色的存在价值了
<24-8,BECKETT>if Jesse Mandalay was a role to die for.

744
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,110
<25-1,BELLA LOMBARDO>是的  那是曼德勒  百分之百  怎么了
<25-1,BELLA LOMBARDO>Yeah. That's Mandalay. 100%. Why?

745
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,940
<25-2,BECKETT>隆巴多女士  我们想知道你几天前
<25-2,BECKETT>Miss Lombardo, we need to know about the $10,000 check

746
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,570
<25-2,BECKETT>有没有写过的一张一万美金的支票给他
<25-2,BECKETT>that you wrote him a couple of days ago.

747

<25-3,BELLA LOMBARDO>Sure. Best money I ever spent.

753
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,860

756
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,070
<25-8,CASTLE>曼德勒就在那儿吗
<25-8,CASTLE>And Mandalay was there himself?

<25-9,BELLA LOMBARDO>我们可以以四十万的价格卖下阁楼
<25-9,BELLA LOMBARDO>we could purchase a loft for $400,000.

<26-7,BECKETT>We're here about Jesse Mandalay.

783
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,240
<26-7,BECKETT>你认识他吗
<26-7,BECKETT>Do you know him?

784
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,420
<26-8,BERT KRAMER>很不巧我认识  他给我惹了一堆麻烦
<26-8,BERT KRAMER>Unfortunately, and if I ever see that guy again, I'm gonna

785
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,330
<26-8,BERT KRAMER>要是让我再看见他
<26-8,BERT KRAMER>bust him in the jaw for

786
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,570
<26-8,BERT KRAMER>-我就打歪他的下巴  -让我猜猜
<26-8,BERT KRAMER>- all the crap he put me through.  - Let me guess.

787
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,330
<26-9,CASTLE>-他利用了你  -没错
<26-9,CASTLE>- He took advantage of you.  - Damn right.

788
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,710
<26-10,BERT KRAMER>他假装这是他的楼盘  然后就卖上了
<26-10,BERT KRAMER>He tried to sell my friggin' property like it was his.

789
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,110
<26-10,BERT KRAMER>他来的时候说自己是地产经纪
<26-10,BERT KRAMER>Showed up here claiming to be a real estate agent,

790
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,750
<26-10,BERT KRAMER>吹嘘自己卖过多少房产
<26-10,BERT KRAMER>and he had this rap about all these properties he's sold.

791
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,450
<26-11,BECKETT>于是你就给了他这栋房子的钥匙
<26-11,BECKETT>And you gave him access to the building?

792
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,610
<26-12,BERT KRAMER>他说他要带一车客户过来
<26-12,BERT KRAMER>Well, he wanted to bring a caravan of clients through,

793
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,890
<26-12,BERT KRAMER>还坚持一定要在周日
<26-12,BERT KRAMER>and he insisted it be on a Sunday,

794
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,720
<26-12,BERT KRAMER>于是我就把开门的密码告诉他了
<26-12,BERT KRAMER>so I gave him the lockbox codes.

795
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,470
<26-13,CASTLE>你怎么发现他是骗子的
<26-13,CASTLE>How did you find out he wasn't legit?

796
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,290
<26-14,BERT KRAMER>自从那天开始
<26-14,BERT KRAMER>Ever since that day,

797
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,810
<26-14,BERT KRAMER>就一直有人来说他们给了曼德勒钱
<26-14,BERT KRAMER>I got people showing up saying they got the Mandalay deal

798
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,630
<26-14,BERT KRAMER>并且威胁要起诉我
<26-14,BERT KRAMER>and threatening to sue.

799
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,860
<26-15,BECKETT>我们有理由相信
<26-15,BECKETT>Well, we have reason to believe

800
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,880
<26-15,BECKETT>曼德勒是同伙作案
<26-15,BECKETT>that Mandalay was working with a partner.

801
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,520
<26-15,BECKETT>还有别人联系过你吗
<26-15,BECKETT>Did anyone else contact you?

802
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,870
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>没有
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>Uh, no.

803
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,950
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>这件事过后  再没人来过这里
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>And when the tents folded up, it was radio silence.

804
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,010
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>但是我联系了其他的一些发展商
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>But I did call some of the other developers,

805
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,680
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>果不其然  这个叫曼德勒的家伙
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>and sure enough, this Mandalay guy,

806
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,640
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>他也带过一堆客户去他们的楼盘
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>he brought caravans to their properties.

807
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,410
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>现在他们也在面对同样的混乱
<26-16,BERT KRAMER>Now they're dealing with the same mess.

808
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,650
<26-17,BECKETT>你有宣传册子吗
<26-17,BECKETT>Do you have any brochures?

809
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,050
<26-17,BECKETT>我正在找房子  我原先的地方炸掉了
<26-17,BECKETT>I'm looking for a place. Mine blew up.

810
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,310
<27-1,CASTLE>每人骗一万
<27-1,CASTLE>10 grand a pop

811
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,740
<27-1,CASTLE>在泽西州到处骗
<27-1,CASTLE>all over Jersey.

812
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,080
<27-1,CASTLE>很快就是一大笔钱了
<27-1,CASTLE>That adds up quick.

813
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,280
<27-2,BECKETT>我不明白在德里克被杀当晚
<27-2,BECKETT>I don't understand why Derek was still working

814
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,060
<27-2,BECKETT>他为什么还要去做脱衣舞男
<27-2,BECKETT>as a stripper the night that he was killed

815
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,410
<27-2,BECKETT>如果他参与了这么赚钱的一个骗局
<27-2,BECKETT>if he was involved in a scam

816
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,700
<27-2,BECKETT>何必还要去跳脱衣舞呢
<27-2,BECKETT>that was raking in that much money.

817
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,600
<27-3,CASTLE>因为他不是最终收钱的那个人
<27-3,CASTLE>Because he wasn't the one raking in all the dough.

818
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,460
<27-3,CASTLE>他只是个演员  就是个靠长相
<27-3,CASTLE>He was just the actor, hired for his looks

819
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,460
<27-4,BECKETT>-靠性格骗钱的幌子  -所以一直以来
<27-4,BECKETT>- and his personality to charm the investors.  - So all along,

820
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,800
<27-4,BECKETT>德里克看着他的同伙把钱存进银行
<27-4,BECKETT>Derek sees his partner taking the money to the bank...

821
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,400
<27-5,CASTLE>可当他惹上了那帮摩托党以后
<27-5,CASTLE>and when he gets in trouble with the bikers

822
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,960
<27-5,CASTLE>他突然间需要现金
<27-5,CASTLE>and suddenly he needs cash...

823
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,350
<27-6,BECKETT>他从银行账户里偷拿了他需要的两万五
<27-6,BECKETT>He raids the bank account for the 25 grand that he needs,

824
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,950
<27-6,BECKETT>然后被他的同伙发现了
<27-6,BECKETT>and his partner figures it out.

825
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,380
<27-7,CASTLE>于是他的同伙跟他发生了激烈的对质
<27-7,CASTLE>Which leads to a heated confrontation

826
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,820
<27-7,CASTLE>他承认借了这笔钱
<27-7,CASTLE>where he admits to borrowing the money,

827
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,780
<27-7,CASTLE>但是  但是他说他要退出这场骗局
<27-7,CASTLE>but...but he says he's pulling out of the scam.

829
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,090
<27-8,BECKETT>知道了  谢谢
<27-8,BECKETT>Got it. Thanks.

830
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,460
<27-8,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托做了些调查
<27-8,BECKETT>Ryan and Esposito did a little bit of digging,

831
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,050
<27-8,BECKETT>他们找到了德里克用来取钱的那个
<27-8,BECKETT>and they found the real owner of the Sunfire account

832
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,690
<27-8,BECKETT>太阳火账户的真正所有人
<27-8,BECKETT>that Derek used to withdraw the money.

833
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,400
<27-8,BECKETT>太阳火的公司注册证书
<27-8,BECKETT>The articles of incorporation

834
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:41,680
<27-8,BECKETT>是由我们那位热爱兰花的寡妇
<27-8,BECKETT>were signed by our very own orchid-loving widow --

835
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,060
<27-8,BECKETT>瑞贝卡·达顿签的
<27-8,BECKETT>Rebecca Dalton.

836
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,360
<27-9,CASTLE>不是吧
<27-9,CASTLE>Shut the front door.

837
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,400
<28-1,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  你确定吗
<28-1,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, you sure about this?

838
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,210
<28-2,BECKETT>头儿  都白纸黑字在这摆着呢
<28-2,BECKETT>Sir, it's all right here in black and white.

839
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,880
<28-2,BECKETT>我们追踪房地产诈骗案中的金钱去向
<28-2,BECKETT>We tracked the money from the real estate scam

840
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,170
<28-2,BECKETT>查到了一个在开曼群岛的海外账户
<28-2,BECKETT>to this offshore account in the Cayman islands.

841
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,240
<28-3,MONTGOMERY>这么说德里克决定不再扮演曼德勒
<28-3,MONTGOMERY>So Derek decides he's done playing the Mandalay role,

842
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,910
<28-3,MONTGOMERY>但是因为他知道的太多了
<28-3,MONTGOMERY>and because he knows too much,

843
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,930
<28-3,MONTGOMERY>所以唯一的选择就是杀了他灭口
<28-3,MONTGOMERY>the only option is to kill him.

844
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,890
<28-4,RYAN>你是对的
<28-4,RYAN>Hey. You were right.

845
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,110
<28-4,RYAN>我证实了瑞贝卡·达顿的下落
<28-4,RYAN>I was able to confirm Rebecca Dalton's whereabouts.

846
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,440
<28-5,BECKETT>去申请搜查令  搜查杀人凶器
<28-5,BECKETT>Get a warrant to search for the murder weapon.

847
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,490
<28-6,CASTLE>作为一个
<28-6,CASTLE>As someone who's written just about

848
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,950
<28-6,CASTLE>写书无数的作家来说
<28-6,CASTLE>every ending in the book,

849
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,630
<28-6,CASTLE>我可以说"太精彩了"吗
<28-6,CASTLE>can I just say...amazing?

850
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,840
<28-7,BECKETT>等犯人认罪了再说也不迟
<28-7,BECKETT>You can say that after we get the confession.

851
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,660
<29-1,BECKETT>达顿女士  我们仔细查过了你的经济状况
<29-1,BECKETT>Ms. Dalton, we did a thorough search of your finances.

852
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,470
<29-1,BECKETT>自你丈夫过世后
<29-1,BECKETT>You've lost quite a lot of money

853
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,720
<29-1,BECKETT>你损失了一大笔钱
<29-1,BECKETT>since your husband passed away.

854
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,930
<29-2,MICHAEL GRANT>我的委托人不需要澄清她的花费习惯
<29-2,MICHAEL GRANT>My client doesn't need to defend her spending habits.

855
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,480
<29-3,BECKETT>如果这与案情有关  她就需要作出解释
<29-3,BECKETT>She does if it's relevant to my case.

856
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,780
<29-4,REBECCA DALTON>我的钱跟德里克的死有什么关系
<29-4,REBECCA DALTON>What does my money have to do with Derek's death?

857
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,230
<29-5,CASTLE>实际上  有很大关系
<29-5,CASTLE>Everything, actually.

858
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,410
<29-6,BECKETT>你投资了一个从未上架的服装生产线
<29-6,BECKETT>Let's see, there is a clothing line that never took off,

859
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,550
<29-6,BECKETT>还有一个失败的珠宝生意
<29-6,BECKETT>a, uh, failed jewelry business.

860
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,020
<29-6,BECKETT>还要我继续说下去吗
<29-6,BECKETT>I mean, should I go on?

861
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,610
<29-7,REBECCA DALTON>这些不能说明我是杀人犯呀
<29-7,REBECCA DALTON>That doesn't make me a murderer.

862
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,980
<29-8,BECKETT>用不了多久
<29-8,BECKETT>Well, it was only a matter of time

863
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,120
<29-8,BECKETT>你的钱就会败光的
<29-8,BECKETT>until all the money was gone.

864
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,380
<29-9,CASTLE>德里克很帅  很有魅力
<29-9,CASTLE>Derek was handsome, he was charming.

865
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,870
<29-9,CASTLE>你知道他是个优秀的演员
<29-9,CASTLE>You knew he was a decent actor.

866
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,550
<29-9,CASTLE>他很适合去向投资者们推荐
<29-9,CASTLE>It made him the perfect guy to present investors

867
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,220
<29-9,CASTLE>一个无人能敌的投资机会
<29-9,CASTLE>with an opportunity they couldn't refuse.

868
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,190
<29-10,MICHAEL GRANT>这只是你们的大胆假设
<29-10,MICHAEL GRANT>This is wildly speculative,

869
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,070
<29-10,MICHAEL GRANT>而且你们的指控毫无根据
<29-10,MICHAEL GRANT>and your allegations are baseless.

870
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,880
<29-11,BECKETT>德里克从一个叫做太阳火的银行账户里
<29-11,BECKETT>Derek took 25 grand from an account

871
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,470
<29-11,BECKETT>取了两万五千美金  这账户一开始
<29-11,BECKETT>that initially led us in circles --

872
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,150
<29-11,BECKETT>让我们的调查陷入僵局  但现在
<29-11,BECKETT>The Sunfire account.

873
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,590
<29-12,REBECCA DALTON>这不可能  这都不是我签的
<29-12,REBECCA DALTON>Well, this isn't possible. I didn't even sign this.

874
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,580
<29-13,MICHAEL GRANT>瑞贝卡  我建议你不要再多说了
<29-13,MICHAEL GRANT>Rebecca, I'm advising you, don't say another word.

875
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,310
<29-14,REBECCA DALTON>等一下  九月二十九号
<29-14,REBECCA DALTON>Wait a minute. September 29th?

876
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,620
<29-14,REBECCA DALTON>我那天都不在国内
<29-14,REBECCA DALTON>I wasn't even in the country.

877
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,290
<29-15,BECKETT>我们知道
<29-15,BECKETT>We know.

878
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,650
<29-16,CASTLE>这个注册证书签署的那天
<29-16,CASTLE>The date it was signed?

879
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,620
<29-16,CASTLE>正值巴黎时装周
<29-16,CASTLE>Smack-dab in the middle of Paris fashion week.

880
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,060
<29-17,BECKETT>我知道任何一个称职的
<29-17,BECKETT>I knew that any former model

881
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,100
<29-17,BECKETT>前任模特都会去参加时装周的
<29-17,BECKETT>worth her salt would've been there,

882
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,990
<29-17,BECKETT>当然了  我们也查过航空公司的记录
<29-17,BECKETT>and of course, after checking flight records,

883
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,900
<29-17,BECKETT>你当时确实在巴黎
<29-17,BECKETT>you were in paris.

884
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,110
<29-18,CASTLE>没错  就当你在巴黎喝着香槟的时候
<29-18,CASTLE>Yes, and while you were drinking champagne,

885
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,080
<29-18,CASTLE>你的律师用你的资料设立了这个账户
<29-18,CASTLE>your lawyer was using his access to your information

886
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,260
<29-18,CASTLE>以你的名义招摇撞骗
<29-18,CASTLE>to create a scam in your name.

887
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,970
<29-18,CASTLE>他还从你这偷钱
<29-18,CASTLE>Oh, he was also stealing from you,

888
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,170
<29-18,CASTLE>把你的钱都转到了他的海外账户
<29-18,CASTLE>funneling the money into his offshore account.

889
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,670
<29-18,CASTLE>所以你的那些生意才会失败
<29-18,CASTLE>That's why your businesses failed.

890
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,090
<29-19,BECKETT>他背着你给德里克提供了一个工作机会
<29-19,BECKETT>He offered Derek a job behind your back

891
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,940
<29-19,BECKETT>那就是扮演杰西·曼德勒
<29-19,BECKETT>to play Jesse Mandalay.

892
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,670
<29-20,CASTLE>他开的价钱很高
<29-20,CASTLE>The money was decent,

893
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,420
<29-20,CASTLE>但是当那些摩托党找上德里克之后
<29-20,CASTLE>but when the bikers came after Derek,

894
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,070
<29-20,CASTLE>他需要更多的钱
<29-20,CASTLE>he needed more.

895
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,610
<29-21,REBECCA DALTON>天啊  迈克尔  你干了什么
<29-21,REBECCA DALTON>Oh, my god. Michael, what did you do?

896
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,350
<29-21,REBECCA DALTON>当你发现德里克未经许可
<29-21,REBECCA DALTON>When you found out that

897
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,450
<29-22,BECKETT>就从账户里取了钱之后
<29-22,BECKETT>Derek made an unauthorized withdrawal,

898
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,180
<29-22,BECKETT>你去找他对质
<29-22,BECKETT>you confronted him,

899
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,450
<29-22,BECKETT>但是他知道你不可能去报警
<29-22,BECKETT>but he knew that you couldn't go to the cops,

900
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,590
<29-22,BECKETT>于是他说他想退出
<29-22,BECKETT>so he told you that he wanted out.

901
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,820
<29-22,BECKETT>你担心他会揭穿你的骗局
<29-22,BECKETT>You couldn't afford him exposing your fraud,

902
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,310
<29-22,BECKETT>于是你跟踪他出了家门
<29-22,BECKETT>so you followed him from his apartment,

903
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,150
<29-22,BECKETT>然后再于当晚将他杀害
<29-22,BECKETT>and then killed him that night.

904
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,700
<29-23,MICHAEL GRANT>我不会再多说一个字了
<29-23,MICHAEL GRANT>I'm not saying another word.

905
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,610
<29-24,CASTLE>你要请律师吗
<29-24,CASTLE>Do you want a lawyer...

906
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,740
<29-24,CASTLE>还是你想找个演员来扮演律师
<29-24,CASTLE>or do you want to hire an actor to play one for you?

907
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,700
<30-1,MARTHA>你那个艰苦奋斗的演员案怎么样了
<30-1,MARTHA>So what happened with your struggling actor case?

908
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,730
<30-2,CASTLE>他们在律师的办公室
<30-2,CASTLE>Well, they found the murder weapon

909
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,190
<30-2,CASTLE>找到了凶器
<30-2,CASTLE>at the lawyer's office.

910
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,390
<30-2,CASTLE>他为了达成庭外协议而招供了
<30-2,CASTLE>He confessed in an effort to cut a deal.

911
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,070
<30-3,MARTHA>天啊  太令人难过了
<30-3,MARTHA>Oh, god. It's so sad.

912
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,100
<30-3,MARTHA>那可怜的孩子只是想转运而已
<30-3,MARTHA>The poor kid was just trying to catch a break,

913
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,950
<30-3,MARTHA>却一直霉运连连
<30-3,MARTHA>and he kept stepping in the dog poo.

914
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,700
<30-4,CASTLE>你该把这句话绣在枕头上
<30-4,CASTLE>You should stitch that on to a pillow.

915
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,020
<30-5,CASTLE>亲爱的  你回来啦
<30-5,CASTLE>Oh! Hey, sweetie.

916
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,030
<30-5,CASTLE>咱们家诞生了一位桑德拉·狄吗[《火爆浪子》的女主角]
<30-5,CASTLE>Do we have a Sandra Dee in our midst?

917
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,430
<30-6,ALEXIS>我没被选上
<30-6,ALEXIS>I didn't get the part.

918
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,050
<30-7,MARTHA>宝贝儿
<30-7,MARTHA>Oh, honey.

919
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,300
<30-7,MARTHA>这是对于你来说  最好的一件事了
<30-7,MARTHA>This is...the best thing that has ever happened to you.

920
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,410
<30-7,MARTHA>-什么  -失败正是成功之母
<30-7,MARTHA>- Wh --  - Rejection is the bedrock of a great acting career.

921
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,810
<30-7,MARTHA>一个演员就是要在挫折中成长
<30-7,MARTHA>Until an actor has suffered, he hasn't really lived.

922
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,770
<30-8,ALEXIS>谢谢  奶奶
<30-8,ALEXIS>Thanks, gram.

923
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,450
<30-9,MARTHA>不客气
<30-9,MARTHA>You're welcome.

924
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,390
<30-9,MARTHA>还有  试镜就像是找男人
<30-9,MARTHA>And besides, auditions are like men.

925
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,910
<30-9,MARTHA>错过这个  转角处还会遇到下一个
<30-9,MARTHA>There's another one right around the corner.

926
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,460
<30-10,CASTLE>你要去哪
<30-10,CASTLE>Where are you going?

927
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,210
<30-11,MARTHA>我们需要雪糕来缓解伤痛  笨蛋
<30-11,MARTHA>Oh, we need ice cream to ease the pain, stat.

928
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,520
<30-11,MARTHA>我去转角的便利店
<30-11,MARTHA>I'm going to the corner store.

929
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,070
<30-12,CASTLE>我很遗憾 宝贝
<30-12,CASTLE>I am sorry, sweetie.

930
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,670
<30-13,ALEXIS>我能坦白一件事吗
<30-13,ALEXIS>Can I admit something?

931
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,940
<30-14,CASTLE>-当然  -跟凯莉争这个角色
<30-14,CASTLE>- Always.  - Going up against Kelly

932
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,380
<30-15,ALEXIS>让我意识到  我根本不想要这个角色
<30-15,ALEXIS>made me realize, I didn't really want the part.

933
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,580
<30-15,ALEXIS>我能看出她有多想要那个角色
<30-15,ALEXIS>I could see how hungry she was,

934
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,880
<30-15,ALEXIS>而我又不想让奶奶失望
<30-15,ALEXIS>and I didn't want to disappoint gram,

935
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,220
<30-15,ALEXIS>但是我就是没她那么喜欢演戏
<30-15,ALEXIS>but I don't love it the way she does.

936
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,190
<30-16,CASTLE>也许和奶奶会说的相反  你就不是这块料
<30-16,CASTLE>Well, maybe it's not "in your bones", as gram would say.

937
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,530
<30-16,CASTLE>你肯去尝试  我已经感到很骄傲了
<30-16,CASTLE>I am proud of you for trying.

938
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,730
<30-17,ALEXIS>谢谢  老爸  而且坏事变好事
<30-17,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad. And there's a silver lining.

939
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,800
<30-17,ALEXIS>在角色公布了以后
<30-17,ALEXIS>After the announcement,

940
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,640
<30-17,ALEXIS>戏剧老师让我做舞台监督
<30-17,ALEXIS>the drama teacher offered me stage manager.

941
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,850
<30-17,ALEXIS>这更适合我
<30-17,ALEXIS>It's way more my style,

942
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,370
<30-17,ALEXIS>而且我还可以继续参加其他课后兴趣班
<30-17,ALEXIS>and I get to keep all my after-school clubs.

943
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,750
<30-18,CASTLE>我的小优等生
<30-18,CASTLE>My little overachiever.

944
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,690
<30-18,CASTLE>祝贺你没有得到那个角色
<30-18,CASTLE>Well, congratulations on not getting the part.

945
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,980
<30-19,ALEXIS>是什么这么香
<30-19,ALEXIS>Mmm. What smells good?

946
