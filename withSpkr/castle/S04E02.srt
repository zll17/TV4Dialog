34
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,510
<2-16,ALEXIS>因为我每次提起  你脸上就那副表情
<2-16,ALEXIS>Because every time I did, I saw the look on your face.

38
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,420

<3-18,LANIE>要我说他早就不担心他的小老弟了
<3-18,LANIE>I'd say his unit is the least of his problems.

74
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,780
<3-19,CASTLE>那是你不理解一个男人和他的
<3-19,CASTLE>Then you do not understand the sacred bond

75
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
<3-19,CASTLE>小老弟之间神圣的感情

<3-21,LANIE>剑尖断在身体里面了
<3-21,LANIE>The tip broke off in the body.

79
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,120
<3-21,LANIE>从血迹喷溅来看
<3-21,LANIE>Blood spatter indicates

80
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,270
<3-21,LANIE>凶手首先砍掉了被害人的手
<3-21,LANIE>that the killer first lopped off the victim's hand,

81
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,910
<3-21,LANIE>之后一剑纵劈
<3-21,LANIE>then took the big swing.

<3-22,CASTLE>Man, a sword. That is so "Game of Thrones."

84
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,010
<3-23,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  看起来
<3-23,BECKETT>Esposito, this looks like

85
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,240
<3-23,BECKETT>这可能是仪式性的凶杀
<3-23,BECKETT>it might have been a ritual killing,

86
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,080
<3-23,BECKETT>给所有旁观者取像
<3-23,BECKETT>so let's get photos of all the bystanders

87
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,890
<3-23,BECKETT>-以防凶手回来查看  -这就去
<3-23,BECKETT>- in case the killer came back. - On it.

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,050
<3-26,ESPOSITO>有  他当时正要侵犯的女孩
<3-26,ESPOSITO>Yeah, the girl he was in the middle of assaulting,

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,490
<3-26,ESPOSITO>名叫玛丽·马卡多
<3-26,ESPOSITO>a Marie Marcado.

93
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,220
<4-1,MARIE>我昨晚在街角的马特酒吧遇见了他
<4-1,MARIE>I met him last night at Matt's bar around the corner.

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
<4-1,MARIE>他看起来挺不错
<4-1,MARIE>He seemed like a nice enough guy,

95
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,900
<4-1,MARIE>一直说他就要发大财了
<4-1,MARIE>Talking all big about his ship coming in.

96
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,340
<4-1,MARIE>总之  天晚了
<4-1,MARIE>Anyway... It got late.

97
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,460
<4-1,MARIE>我和他一起走了
<4-1,MARIE>I left with him.

98
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,710
<4-1,MARIE>但之后他就开始变得特别粗暴
<4-1,MARIE>But that's when he started getting all super aggressive.

99
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,690
<4-1,MARIE>我跑开后他抓住了我
<4-1,MARIE>I took off running. He caught me.

100
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,970
<4-1,MARIE>天知道他会对我做出什么  多亏了...
<4-1,MARIE>I mean, god knows what he would've done if--

101
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,220
<4-2,CASTLE>多亏蛮王柯南及时出现
<4-2,CASTLE>If Conan the barbarian hadn't shown up?

102
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,120
<4-3,BECKETT>凶手长什么样
<4-3,BECKETT>What did the killer look like?

103
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,480
<4-4,MARIE>太黑了  我没有看见他的脸
<4-4,MARIE>It was so dark, I didn't really get to see his face.

104
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,270
<4-5,BECKETT>你没看见任何特征
<4-5,BECKETT>You didn't catch anything--

<5-1,BECKETT>她对我们有所隐瞒
<5-1,BECKETT>She's holding out on us.

107
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,150
<5-2,CASTLE>蛮王柯南救了她的命
<5-2,CASTLE>Well, Conan probably saved her life.

108
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,460
<5-2,CASTLE>她才不想出卖他[也有害他被大巴碾过之意]
<5-2,CASTLE>She doesn't want to throw him under the bus

109
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,820
<5-2,CASTLE>或者是宾虚风格的二轮战车
<5-2,CASTLE>or under a Ben-Hur-style chariot.

110
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,960
<5-3,BECKETT>对  但她看见凶手了
<5-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but she saw the killer.

111
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,720
<5-3,BECKETT>就不担心自己的安全吗
<5-3,BECKETT>Isn't she afraid for her life?

112
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,810
<5-4,CASTLE>她可能知道他不会加害于她
<5-4,CASTLE>She probably knows he wasn't after her.

113
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,740
<5-4,CASTLE>恶劣惯犯被一分为二
<5-4,CASTLE>A career felon smited in two?

114
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,400
<5-4,CASTLE>这很有圣经旧约风范啊
<5-4,CASTLE>That's very old testament.

115
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,690
<5-4,CASTLE>有点"侠士"除恶的味道
<5-4,CASTLE>This--this plays like a vigilante killing.

116
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,350
<5-4,CASTLE>就像《紧急追捕令》里警探哈里手持配剑
<5-4,CASTLE>Think Dirty Harry with a sword.

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,720
<5-5,BECKETT>偏偏赶上法瑞斯犯罪的时候
<5-5,BECKETT>Who just happens to be in the alley

118
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,470
<5-5,BECKETT>出现在巷子里吗
<5-5,BECKETT>when Faris is committing a felony?

119
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,860
<5-5,BECKETT>时机有点可疑
<5-5,BECKETT>That timing is a little suspicious.

120
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,020
<5-5,BECKETT>凶手大概从酒吧就跟上了他
<5-5,BECKETT>The killer probably followed him from the bar.

121
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,940
<5-6,CASTLE>带把剑吗
<5-6,CASTLE>With a sword?

122
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,580
<5-6,CASTLE>确实是个问题
<5-6,CASTLE>Touche.

123
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,930
<5-7,BECKETT>我们去和他的家属谈谈吧
<5-7,BECKETT>Let's talk to the next of kin.

124
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,860
<6-1,BECKETT>法瑞斯太太  请你节哀顺变
<6-1,BECKETT>Mrs. Faris, we're very sorry for your loss.

125
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,160
<6-1,BECKETT>别担心
<6-1,BECKETT>Don't sweat it.

126
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,230
<6-2,BECKETT>你说什么
<6-2,BECKETT>Pardon me?

127
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,520
<6-2,BECKETT>这种事时有发生
<6-2,BECKETT>These things can happen.

128
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,490
<6-3,CASTLE>在这个世纪不会吧
<6-3,CASTLE>Not in this century, they don't.

129
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,900
<6-3,CASTLE>别理解错了
<6-3,CASTLE>Don't get me wrong,

130
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,940
<9-1,ESPOSITO>我从没想过我儿子会被人切成两半儿
<9-1,ESPOSITO>I never expected my boy to end up in two hunks.

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,300
<9-2,RYAN>但我一直知道总有一天
<9-2,RYAN>But I always knew, one day,

132
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,600
<9-3,ESPOSITO>他会落得这个下场  躺在停尸房里
<9-3,ESPOSITO>he'd end up there, laying on a slab.

133
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,900
<9-4,BECKETT>这又是为什么呢
<9-4,BECKETT>And why is that?

134
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,090
<6-3,CASTLE>因为他就是个一无是处的废物
<6-3,CASTLE>Because Tyler was a no-good loser.

135
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,290
<6-4,CASTLE>接二连三的闯祸犯错
<6-4,CASTLE>He made one dumbass mistake after the next.

136
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,870
<6-5,BECKETT>我懂了  据你所知他有没有
<6-5,BECKETT>I see. Um, do you know if he was involved

137
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,960
<6-5,BECKETT>卷入什么可能给他招来杀身之祸的事呢
<6-5,BECKETT>in anything that might have gotten him killed?

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,820
<6-5,BECKETT>我猜绝对是有
<6-5,BECKETT>Oh, I certainly expect so.

139
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,730
<6-6,BECKETT>他告诉一个人他马上要发财了
<6-6,BECKETT>He told someone that his ship was coming in.

140
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,780
<6-6,BECKETT>这是什么意思
<6-6,BECKETT>What does that mean?

141
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,390
<6-6,BECKETT>他总是马上要发财了
<6-6,BECKETT>His ship was always coming in.

142
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,690
<6-6,BECKETT>泰勒就是那样  满嘴跑火车
<6-6,BECKETT>That was Tyler, always working an angle.

143
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,380
<6-7,BECKETT>太太  我需要知道
<6-7,BECKETT>Ma'am, um, I'll need the names

144
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,230
<6-7,BECKETT>你儿子所有仇人的名字
<6-7,BECKETT>0f all the enemies your son may have had.

145
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,670
<6-7,BECKETT>那你得拿个大点的本了
<6-7,BECKETT>You're gonna need a bigger pad.

146
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,120
<6-7,BECKETT>盗窃  伤人  诈骗
<6-7,BECKETT>Larceny, assault, fraud--

147
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,650
<7-1,RYAN>只要你想得出  他都干过
<7-1,RYAN>you name it, Tyler Faris has done it.

148
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,900
<7-1,RYAN>尽管如此  也不至于死得那么...惨
<7-1,RYAN>Still, nobody deserves ending up like... that.

149
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,180
<7-2,ESPOSITO>那是他罪有应得
<7-2,ESPOSITO>He got what was coming to him.

150
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,650
<7-3,RYAN>兄弟  那得由刑事司法系统做决断
<7-3,RYAN>Dude, that's for the criminal justice system to decide.

151
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,500
<7-4,ESPOSITO>或许那把剑也是一种司法[正义]系统呢
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Well, maybe a sword is a justice system.

152
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,170
<7-5,RYAN>你要是昆汀·塔伦蒂诺那还说得过去
<7-5,RYAN>Yeah, if you're Quentin Tarantino, maybe.

153
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,240
<7-6,ESPOSITO>在过去的六个月里他多次打给
<7-6,ESPOSITO>He made lots of calls to an untraceable burner phone

154
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,620
<7-6,ESPOSITO>一个无法追踪的电话
<7-6,ESPOSITO>in the past six months.

155
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,960
<7-6,ESPOSITO>确实是人渣罪犯干的事
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Behavior consistent with a criminal dirtbag.

156
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,140
<7-6,ESPOSITO>听听这个
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Check this out.

157
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,560
<7-6,ESPOSITO>泰勒·法瑞斯在三天前在酒馆与人起冲突
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Tyler Faris got into an altercation at a bodega three days ago.

158
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,590
<7-6,ESPOSITO>等警察来的时候他已经跑了
<7-6,ESPOSITO>He was gone by the time the cops showed up,

159
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,710
<7-6,ESPOSITO>但是店主说他因为钱的事
<7-6,ESPOSITO>but the shopkeeper says that he was fighting

160
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,560
<7-6,ESPOSITO>和一个家伙打了起来
<7-6,ESPOSITO>with some other guy over money.

161
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,580
<7-7,RYAN>-记下那家伙叫什么了吗  -记了
<7-7,RYAN>- Does the other guy have a name? - Yeah.

162
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,330
<7-9,ESPOSITO>托尼·沃迪尼  这个家伙也有案底
<7-9,ESPOSITO>Tony Valtini. This guy's got a record, too.

163
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,800
<7-10,RYAN>他当然有了
<7-10,RYAN>Damn right, he does.

164
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,880
<7-10,RYAN>我在缉毒组时就知道他
<7-10,RYAN>I remember Valtini from back in Narcotics.

165
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,820
<7-10,RYAN>这家伙可是黑帮的成员
<7-10,RYAN>The guy is totally mobbed up.

166
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,820
<7-10,RYAN>你猜怎么着
<7-10,RYAN>You know what else?

167
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,790
<7-10,RYAN>他的家族在泽西拥有一家肉类加工厂
<7-10,RYAN>His family owns this meatpacking plant out in Jersey.

168
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,950
<7-10,RYAN>托尼的外号就叫"屠夫托尼"
<7-10,RYAN>Tony's nickname-- "Tony the butcher."

169
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,680
<7-11,ESPOSITO>我猜他以前绝对干过劈牛的活儿
<7-11,ESPOSITO>I bet he split a few sides of beef in his day.

170
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,980
<8-1,TONY>是  我是和法瑞斯吵过嘴
<8-1,TONY>Yeah, I had words with Faris.

171
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,340
<8-1,TONY>他曾在我的企业里为我干活
<8-1,TONY>He used to work for me at Tony Valtini enterprises.

172
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,020
<8-2,BECKETT>哪个部门  毒品销售
<8-2,BECKETT>Which division, drug sales

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,270
<8-2,BECKETT>还是赃物配送
<8-2,BECKETT>or distribution of stolen property?

174
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,180
<8-3,TONY>我是个合法的商人
<8-3,TONY>I am a legitimate businessman.

175
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,260
<8-3,TONY>法瑞斯干砸了  我就把他炒了
<8-3,TONY>Faris sucked at his job, so I canned him.

176
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,190
<8-3,TONY>他觉得我还欠他工资
<8-3,TONY>He thought I owed him back pay.

177
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,920
<8-3,TONY>我们像绅士一样解决了问题
<8-3,TONY>We settled it like gentlemen.

178
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,410
<8-3,TONY>你不相信我  就去问他
<8-3,TONY>You don't believe me, go ask him.

179
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,080
<8-4,CASTLE>那我们就得开个降神会了
<8-4,CASTLE>We'd have to hold a seance.

180
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,790
<8-5,TONY>他死了
<8-5,TONY>He's dead?

181
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,970
<8-6,CASTLE>这么说吧  泰勒·法瑞斯
<8-6,CASTLE>Let's just say, Tyler Faris

182
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,370
<8-6,CASTLE>已经不像过去那么完整了
<8-6,CASTLE>is half the man he used to be.

183
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,220
<8-7,CASTLE>分裂人
<8-7,CASTLE>A man divided?

184
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,120
<8-7,CASTLE>人格分裂
<8-7,CASTLE>Split personality?

185
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,000
<8-7,CASTLE>真的吗  没什么要说的吗
<8-7,CASTLE>Really, nothing?

186
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,200
<8-8,BECKETT>他被人用剑
<8-8,BECKETT>He was cleaved in two

187
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,370
<8-8,BECKETT>劈成两半了
<8-8,BECKETT>with a sword.

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,170
<8-9,TONY>剑
<8-9,TONY>A sword?

189
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,700
<8-10,BECKETT>更像是肉类加工厂用的那种长刀
<8-10,BECKETT>Much like the long knives used at a meatpacking plant.

190
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,840
<8-11,TONY>不是我  这和我一点关系也没有
<8-11,TONY>Oh, hey, it wasn't me. I had nothing to do with it.

191
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,010
<8-11,TONY>但我知道是谁干的
<8-11,TONY>But I know who did.

192
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,210
<8-11,TONY>是那个家伙
<8-11,TONY>It was that guy...

193
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,450
<8-11,TONY>是那个袭击我的疯"侠士"
<8-11,TONY>That nut job vigilante who attacked me.

194
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,420
<8-12,BECKETT>你从没报案说你遇袭
<8-12,BECKETT>You never reported an attack.

195
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,820
<8-13,TONY>因为我不想劳烦执法部门
<8-13,TONY>I don't like to be a burden on law enforcement.

196
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,060
<8-13,TONY>事情是这样的  一天晚上我刚离开我的仓库
<8-13,TONY>Bottom line is, I'm leaving my warehouse one night...

197
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,520
<8-13,TONY>那是两个礼拜前
<8-13,TONY>two weeks ago.

198
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,760
<8-13,TONY>这个拿着剑的家伙突然出现在我面前
<8-13,TONY>All of a sudden, here comes this guy with a sword.

199
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,990
<8-13,TONY>他指控我有犯罪行为
<8-13,TONY>He accuses me of criminal conduct,

200
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,960
<8-13,TONY>顺便提一句  那纯粹是扯淡
<8-13,TONY>unjustly, by the way,

201
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,130
<8-13,TONY>然后威胁说如果我不离开这里就要杀了我  然后
<8-13,TONY>then he threatens to kill me if I don't leave town, and then...

202
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,370
<8-13,TONY>你知道他之后做了什么吗
<8-13,TONY>You know what he does then?

203
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,840
<8-14,BECKETT>他之后做了什么
<8-14,BECKETT>What does he do then?

204
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,670
<8-15,TONY>他
<8-15,TONY>He...

207
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,150
<8-17,CASTLE>-看到那里的疤了吗  -看上去像个L
<8-17,CASTLE>- See that scar there?  - Looks like an "L".

208
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,220
<8-18,BECKETT>沃迪尼先生请你把裤子穿上好吗
<8-18,BECKETT>Mr. Valtini, could you please put your pants back up?

209
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,780
<8-19,TONY>这是他干的
<8-19,TONY>He did that to me!

210
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,650
<8-19,TONY>他用那把剑  割伤了我
<8-19,TONY>He did that, with his sword, to me.

211
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,620
<8-19,TONY>懂了吗
<8-19,TONY>Okay?

212
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,320

<8-21,TONY>我说了你也不会相信我的
<8-21,TONY>You wouldn't even believe me if I told you. Okay?

214
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,190
<8-21,TONY>但是
<8-21,TONY>But...

<8-22,TONY>他逃跑的时候  被我拍到了
<8-22,TONY>When he ran off, I caught him on video.

217
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,540

<9-1,ESPOSITO>The time code lines up with the night

218
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,080
<9-1,ESPOSITO>遇袭当晚的时间吻合
<9-1,ESPOSITO>that Valtini said he was attacked.

219
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,710
<9-2,RYAN>而且根据急诊室的记录

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,560
<9-8,CASTLE>我们的凶手是个超级英雄
<9-8,CASTLE>Our killer is a superhero.

236

<10-2,BECKETT>Yeah, our witness from the alley confirms

239
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,110
<10-2,BECKETT>她看到这个人杀了泰勒·法瑞斯
<10-2,BECKETT>that she saw this man kill Tyler Faris.

240
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,750
<10-3,GATES>那么她之前为什么不说
<10-3,GATES>Well, why didn't she say that before?

241
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,450
<10-4,BECKETT>她认为我们不会相信她
<10-4,BECKETT>She didn't think that we'd believe her.

242
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,190
<10-4,BECKETT>说实话  她没想错
<10-4,BECKETT>And quite frankly, she's right.

243
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,990
<10-5,GATES>一个蒙面"侠士"逍遥法外
<10-5,GATES>A masked vigilante on the loose,

244
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,260
<10-5,GATES>随处砍人
<10-5,GATES>hacking people up?

245
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,520
<10-5,GATES>告诉我你打算怎么将这个人绳之以法
<10-5,GATES>Tell me what your plan is to apprehend this individual.

246
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,030
<10-6,BECKETT>我们在寻找作案手法相同的凶杀案
<10-6,BECKETT>We're, uh, we're looking for murders with the same M.O.,

247
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,060
<10-6,BECKETT>同时也在调查泰勒·法瑞斯和托尼·沃迪尼
<10-6,BECKETT>we're also checking into enemies that Tyler Faris

248
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,860
<10-6,BECKETT>是否有共同的仇家
<10-6,BECKETT>and Tony Valtini might have had in common,

249
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,230
<10-6,BECKETT>还有  我们在查寻
<10-6,BECKETT>and finally, we're trying to track down

250
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,070
<10-6,BECKETT>那套套装和剑的出处
<10-6,BECKETT>where that suit and sword came from.

251
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,970
<10-7,GATES>和贝尔维尤医院联系一下
<10-7,GATES>Reach out to Bellevue.

252
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,100
<10-7,GATES>他们很可能接收过我们的嫌疑犯
<10-7,GATES>They probably admitted our suspect before.

253
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,740
<10-7,GATES>很显然  他不是有妄想症就是个疯子
<10-7,GATES>He's clearly delusional or a psychotic.

254
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,740
<10-8,BECKETT>是的  长官
<10-8,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

255
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,580
<10-9,GATES>随时向我报告进度  探长
<10-9,GATES>Keep me apprised, detective.

256
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,240
<10-10,BECKETT>是
<10-10,BECKETT>Yes.

257
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,410
<11-1,CASTLE>别在贝尔维尤上浪费时间了
<11-1,CASTLE>Don't waste your time on Bellevue.

258
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,180
<11-2,BECKETT>你在偷听
<11-2,BECKETT>You were eavesdropping?

259
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,850
<11-3,CASTLE>我有像超胆侠一般超于常人的听力
<11-3,CASTLE>Can I help it if I have superhuman,

260
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,180
<11-3,CASTLE>这能怪我吗
<11-3,CASTLE>Daredevil-like hearing?

261
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,950
<11-3,CASTLE>我们的凶手不是疯子
<11-3,CASTLE>Our killer is not crazy.

262
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,450
<11-4,BECKETT>他把一个人一劈为二了
<11-4,BECKETT>He cut a man in two

263
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,860
<11-4,BECKETT>而且他还穿着超级英雄的套装到处乱跑
<11-4,BECKETT>and he's running around wearing a superhero suit.

264
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,030
<11-5,CASTLE>我了解服装  这件市面上没有
<11-5,CASTLE>I know costumes. That one is not commercial.

265
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,290
<11-5,CASTLE>很可能是他自己设计的
<11-5,CASTLE>He probably designed it himself,

266
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,660
<11-5,CASTLE>说明了他具有正常人的行为能力
<11-5,CASTLE>which means he's highly functional.

267
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,730
<11-6,BECKETT>你知道我现在想要什么吗
<11-6,BECKETT>You know what I would love right now?

268
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,670
<11-6,BECKETT>我希望有人能给我一个
<11-6,BECKETT>Is if somebody would come here and give me a theory

269
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,870
<11-6,BECKETT>能帮我解决案子的理论
<11-6,BECKETT>that would actually help me solve this case.

270
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,000
<11-7,CASTLE>我有
<11-7,CASTLE>I've got one.

271
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,010
<11-7,CASTLE>所有超级英雄都有一个伪装身份  一个任务
<11-7,CASTLE>Every superhero has a persona, a mission,

272
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,570
<11-7,CASTLE>一个起源故事
<11-7,CASTLE>an origin story.

273
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,910
<11-7,CASTLE>了解他是什么样的英雄  是什么在驱使他
<11-7,CASTLE>Learning who he is as a hero, what drives him,

274
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,810
<11-7,CASTLE>可以帮助我们找到面具后的那个人
<11-7,CASTLE>that will lead us to the man behind the mask.

275
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,080
<11-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们的凶手不是超级英雄
<11-8,BECKETT>Castle, what good is comic book mythology

276
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,320
<11-8,BECKETT>用漫画书里那套分析有个屁用
<11-8,BECKETT>when our killer is not a superhero?

277
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,450
<11-9,CASTLE>如果他是超级英雄呢
<11-9,CASTLE>What if he is a superhero?

278
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,490
<11-9,CASTLE>像这个在皇后区活动的一样
<11-9,CASTLE>Like this one, who operates out of Queens.

279
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,920
<11-9,CASTLE>来认识一下赤红侠
<11-9,CASTLE>Meet... the Red Marune.

280
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,060
<11-10,BECKETT>又赤又红  语义重复唉
<11-10,BECKETT>Red Marune? Isn't that redundant?

281
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,260
<11-11,RED MAROON>不要担心  女士
<11-11,RED MAROON>Don't worry, ma'am.

282
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,900
<11-11,RED MAROON>赤红侠  保护众生  不偏不倚
<11-11,RED MAROON>Red Marune, protector of all, beholding to none.

283
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,570
<11-12,RED MAROON>先生  这显然不是你的钱包
<11-12,RED MAROON>Sir, this is clearly not your purse.

284
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,440
<11-12,RED MAROON>我命令你马上交出来
<11-12,RED MAROON>I demand that you unhand it.

285
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,240
<11-13,RED MAROON>女士  你没事吧
<11-13,RED MAROON>Ma'am, are--are you all right?

286
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,040
<11-14,BECKETT>身手真矫健  令人赞叹
<11-14,BECKETT>Wow. Impressive crime-fighting skills.

287
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,350
<11-14,BECKETT>你说是基因突变还是多年的历练
<11-14,BECKETT>What do you think, mutant powers or years of training?

288
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,050
<11-15,CASTLE>谁都有掉链子的时候嘛
<11-15,CASTLE>Yes, well, sometimes, the runner stumbles.

289
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
<11-15,CASTLE>关键是  现实生活中
<11-15,CASTLE>The point is, there is a subculture

290
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,120
<11-15,CASTLE>确实存在这样一群非主流的超级英雄
<11-15,CASTLE>of real-life superheroes that actually exists out there.

291
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,520
<11-15,CASTLE>为了公众利益而战斗的一群人
<11-15,CASTLE>People crusading for the public good.

292
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,360
<11-16,BECKETT>是的  而且通常他们会被人海扁
<11-16,BECKETT>Yes, and usually, they get their asses kicked,

293
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,290
<11-16,BECKETT>就像这个人
<11-16,BECKETT>just like this guy.

294
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,630
<11-17,CASTLE>我认为我们的"侠士"就是其中之一
<11-17,CASTLE>I think our vigilante is one of them.

295
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,160
<11-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果他为公众利益而战斗的话
<11-18,BECKETT>Castle, if he's a crusader for the public good,

296
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,980
<11-18,BECKETT>那他为什么要劈了泰勒·法瑞斯
<11-18,BECKETT>then why did he partition Tyler Faris?

297
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,430
<11-19,CASTLE>因为  在追寻正义的过程中
<11-19,CASTLE>Ah, because tragically... his pursuit of justice

298
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,970
<11-19,CASTLE>他不幸走上了黑暗的道路
<11-19,CASTLE>has led him down the path of the dark side.

299
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,840
<11-19,CASTLE>这样的宿命曾降临在很多超级英雄身上
<11-19,CASTLE>That is a fate that has befallen many a hero.

300
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,540
<11-20,CASTLE>谢谢
<11-20,CASTLE>Cheers.

301
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,740
<11-20,CASTLE>相信我
<11-20,CASTLE>Trust me,

302
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,680
<11-20,CASTLE>我在超级英雄这条线上已经有所突破
<11-20,CASTLE>I am onto something with this superhero angle.

303
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,680
<11-20,CASTLE>我的直觉蠢蠢欲动
<11-20,CASTLE>My spidey senses are tingling.

304
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,750
<11-21,ESPOSITO>他又怎么了
<11-21,ESPOSITO>What's with him?

305
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,020
<11-22,BECKETT>他的直觉什么蠢什么动
<11-22,BECKETT>Something about spidey senses and tingling.

306
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
<11-23,BECKETT>小巷里的照片
<11-23,BECKETT>Photos from the alley?

307
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,690
<11-24,ESPOSITO>我们可能找到一名嫌犯
<11-24,ESPOSITO>We may have a suspect.

308
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,640
<11-25,ESPOSITO>技术人员说这个人
<11-25,ESPOSITO>Tech says that that guy

309
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,060
<11-25,ESPOSITO>和蒙面侠的身高和体型都相符
<11-25,ESPOSITO>matches the height and build of the guy in the suit.

310
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,790
<11-25,ESPOSITO>不止如此  当他看到警察拍他照片的时候
<11-25,ESPOSITO>Not only that, when he saw the cops taking his pictures,

311
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,490
<11-25,ESPOSITO>他逃走了
<11-25,ESPOSITO>he ran.

312
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,530
<11-26,BECKETT>好的  让巡警拿着照片去排查
<11-26,BECKETT>All right, have uniforms circulate his photo.

313
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,260
<11-26,BECKETT>-我要知道他的名字  -好的
<11-26,BECKETT>- I want to know his name. - All right.

314
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,500
<11-27,EPOSITO>要知道
<11-27,EPOSITO>You know,

315
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,030
<11-28,RYAN>卡塞尔说这个人是超级英雄说不定是对的
<11-28,RYAN>Castle might be right about this guy being a superhero.

316
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,170
<11-28,RYAN>我问了缉毒组的一个兄弟
<11-28,RYAN>I talked to a buddy of mine in narcotics.

317
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,140
<11-28,RYAN>他听说据谣传  道上有个人
<11-28,RYAN>He said he heard rumors about a guy on the streets

318
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,940
<11-28,RYAN>在驱赶毒贩子  还废掉他们的存货
<11-28,RYAN>rousting drug dealers and dumping their stashes--

319
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,680
<11-28,RYAN>是个拿着剑的蒙面人
<11-28,RYAN>a masked man with a sword.

320
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,540
<11-28,RYAN>没错  还是一把武士刀
<11-28,RYAN>Yes, it is a samurai sword.

321
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,810
<11-28,RYAN>所以我们在跟特色商店
<11-28,RYAN>So we're checking specialty stores

322
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,350
<11-28,RYAN>和武术用品供应商核实
<11-28,RYAN>and martial arts suppliers.

323
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,020
<11-29,BECKETT>那套服装查得怎么样了
<11-29,BECKETT>And what about the costume?

324
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,380
<11-30,RYAN>如卡塞尔所说
<11-30,RYAN>Not available in any stores,

325
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,390
<11-30,RYAN>没有商店有卖
<11-30,RYAN>just like Castle said.

326
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,890
<11-31,CASTLE>说到服装
<11-31,CASTLE>Speaking of costumes...

327
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,220
<11-31,CASTLE>我知道凶手是谁了
<11-31,CASTLE>I know who the killer is.

328
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,590
<11-32,CASTLE>请看  我们蒙面"侠士"的照片
<11-32,CASTLE>Behold--a photo of our masked vigilante

329
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,360
<11-32,CASTLE>一同展示的是我收藏的漫威漫画
<11-32,CASTLE>juxtaposed with issues from my own Marvel collection.

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,630
<11-33,BECKETT>你有《终极复仇者》的首刊
<11-33,BECKETT>You have "Avengers" Number 1?

331
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,100
<11-34,CASTLE>不只如此  我还有很多
<11-34,CASTLE>And there's more where that came from.

332
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,230
<11-34,CASTLE>欢迎你随时借阅我的收藏品
<11-34,CASTLE>You're welcome to peruse my issues anytime.

333
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,740
<11-34,CASTLE>请注意凶手
<11-34,CASTLE>Please note how the killer

334
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,040
<11-34,CASTLE>从其他超级英雄的服装上
<11-34,CASTLE>has drawn inspiration from costumes

335
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,340
<11-34,CASTLE>汲取的灵感  例如
<11-34,CASTLE>of other superheroes, for example,

336
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,440
<11-34,CASTLE>它的配色让人想起蜘蛛侠
<11-34,CASTLE>the color scheme evokes Spider-man,

337
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,250
<11-34,CASTLE>带角的头盔  显然是向超胆侠致敬
<11-34,CASTLE>the horned helmet--obviously an homage to Daredevil,

338
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,150
<11-34,CASTLE>剑和剑鞘  取样自死侍
<11-34,CASTLE>the sword and scabbard-- Deadpool,

339
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,650
<11-34,CASTLE>高领  就像黑豹侠一样
<11-34,CASTLE>a high collar, just like Black Panther.

340
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,820
<11-34,CASTLE>那么这些人物的共同点是什么
<11-34,CASTLE>Now what do these characters all have in common?

341
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,190
<11-35,ESPOSITO>他们都是不存在的
<11-35,ESPOSITO>They're make-believe?

342
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,890
<11-36,BECKETT>都是受父亲或爱人的死所驱使
<11-36,BECKETT>They're driven by the death of a father figure or loved one.

343
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,290
<11-37,CASTLE>完全正确
<11-37,CASTLE>Exactly.

344
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,900
<11-38,CASTLE>我认为我们的凶手也有同样的背景故事
<11-38,CASTLE>I believe that our killer shares a similar backstory,

345
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,470
<11-38,CASTLE>所以这些人物的服装
<11-38,CASTLE>which is why he's been inspired

346
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,770
<11-38,CASTLE>给了他启发
<11-38,CASTLE>by these characters' costumes.

347
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,940
<11-38,CASTLE>不仅如此  除了服装之外
<11-38,CASTLE>Furthermore, out of costumes,

348
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,040
<11-38,CASTLE>这些超级英雄比较低调
<11-38,CASTLE>these heroes tend to be unassuming,

349
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,310
<11-38,CASTLE>所以我们应该把举止温和加到嫌疑人侧写里
<11-38,CASTLE>so let's add mild-mannered to our profile.

350
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,210
<11-38,CASTLE>卡塞尔先生
<11-38,CASTLE>Mr. Castle,

351
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,280
<11-39,GATES>你就是这样调查凶杀案的啊
<11-39,GATES>so this is you working a homicide?

352
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,380
<11-39,GATES>一个举止温和  双亲被人杀害的
<11-39,GATES>A superhero who's mild-mannered,

353
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,350
<11-40,GATES>超级英雄
<11-40,GATES>and someone killed his parents?

354
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,050
<11-40,GATES>他们不都是这样吗
<11-40,GATES>Isn't that all of them?

355
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,190
<11-40,GATES>这些能得出什么有用的结论呢
<11-40,GATES>How can any of this produce even one useful conclusion?

356
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,120
<11-41,CASTLE>请注意我们蒙面"侠士"
<11-41,CASTLE>Let me direct your attention to the golden belt

357
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,690
<11-41,CASTLE>戴的金色皮带
<11-41,CASTLE>worn by our masked vigilante,

358
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,230
<11-41,CASTLE>是根据《钢铁侠》在1963年发行的11期原版漫画
<11-41,CASTLE>based on the golden belt worn by Iron Man

359
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,130
<11-41,CASTLE>中所戴的金色皮带创作的
<11-41,CASTLE>in only 11 original issues in 1963.

360
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,270
<11-42,GATES>这又证明了什么呢
<11-42,GATES>Which proves what, exactly?

361
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,870
<11-43,CASTLE>我们的凶手收集漫画书
<11-43,CASTLE>Our killer collected comic books,

362
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,240
<11-43,CASTLE>意味着这个城市中有一个地方
<11-43,CASTLE>which means there is one place in this city

363
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,310
<11-43,CASTLE>他肯定会去
<11-43,CASTLE>he would definitely go.

364
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,080
<12-1,BECKETT>你知道吗  卡塞尔
<12-1,BECKETT>You know, Castle,

365
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,180
<12-1,BECKETT>你应该等到盖茨对你的态度缓和之后
<12-1,BECKETT>You might want to tone down the theories

366
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,910
<12-1,BECKETT>再大肆宣扬你的理论
<12-1,BECKETT>until Gates warms up to you.

367
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,950
<12-2,CASTLE>我准备通过解决这个案子
<12-2,CASTLE>Oh, I plan to melt captain permafrost

368
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,250
<12-2,CASTLE>来融化那座"万年冰山"
<12-2,CASTLE>by solving this case.

369
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,290
<12-3,BECKETT>好吧  祝你好运
<12-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, good luck with that one.

370
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
<12-4,CASTLE>你闻到没有
<12-4,CASTLE>You smell that...

371
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,720
<12-4,CASTLE>散发着油墨的味道
<12-4,CASTLE>Wafting scent of printed pages?

372
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,460
<12-4,CASTLE>漫画世界在召唤
<12-4,CASTLE>Comicadia beckons.

<12-4,CASTLE>是朝圣者的麦加  是待产鱼儿的上游...
<12-4,CASTLE>It's Mecca to a pilgrim. It's upstream to a spawning--

376
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,430
<12-5,BECKETT>这我知道  卡塞尔
<12-5,BECKETT>I know, Castle.

377
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,900
<12-5,BECKETT>我十四岁的时候在这买了第一套漫画
<12-5,BECKETT>I bought my first comic here when I was 14.

<12-8,CASTLE>一个冷酷的女刺客  隐藏着自己的情感
<12-8,CASTLE>Ah, a ruthless assassin who hides from her emotions.

384
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,750
<12-9,BECKETT>我选她或许是因为她的忍术超赞
<12-9,BECKETT>No, maybe it's because she's got badass ninja skills.

385
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,140
<12-10,CASTLE>换你选什么  钢铁侠  蜘蛛侠
<12-10,CASTLE>What about you? Iron Man? Spider-man?

<13-6,MIKE>我们刚刚拿到德里克·斯道姆漫画小说
<13-6,MIKE>We just got your Derrick Storm graphic novel.

401
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,050
<13-6,MIKE>那画面  那文字...
<13-6,MIKE>I mean, the art, the writing--

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,300
<13-6,MIKE>三个字  酷毙了
<13-6,MIKE>It is, in a word, awesome.

<13-7,CASTLE>Tell me, what's your favorite part?

404
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,060
<13-8,BECKETT>你不必回答那个问题
<13-8,BECKETT>You don't have to answer that question.

405
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,730
<13-8,BECKETT>他已经够自大的啦
<13-8,BECKETT>His ego does not need any more feeding.

406
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,080
<13-9,MIKE>当然是德里克·斯道姆为逃脱俩坏蛋的魔掌
<13-9,MIKE>Definitely where Derrick Storm escapes from the two bad guys

407

<13-9,MIKE>-撞烂了出租车  -出租车
<13-9,MIKE>- by crashing the taxi cab. - Taxi cab.

409
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,160
<13-10,MIKE>我不该透剧的
<13-10,MIKE>I should've said spoiler alert.

410
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,970
<13-11,BECKETT>没关系  反正我也没打算读
<13-11,BECKETT>Oh, no. That's okay. I won't be reading it.

411
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,150
<13-12,MIKE>当真  我们的名单上有你的名字啊
<13-12,MIKE>Really? I saw your name on our list.

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,400
<13-12,MIKE>你也预购了一本
<13-12,MIKE>You preordered a copy.

413
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,550
<13-13,CASTLE>是吗
<13-13,CASTLE>Did she now?

414
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,390
<13-14,BECKETT>我只是稍微支持你一下而已
<13-14,BECKETT>I was just being supportive.

415
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,590
<13-15,BECKETT>不管怎样  我们来这不是为了那事
<13-15,BECKETT>Anyway, we're not here about that.

416
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,950
<13-15,BECKETT>我们有几个问题要问你
<13-15,BECKETT>We need to ask you a few questions.

417
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,900
<13-16,CASTLE>是的  有问题
<13-16,CASTLE>Yes, we do.

418
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,490
<13-16,CASTLE>你认识早期《钢铁侠》的收集者吗
<13-16,CASTLE>I don't suppose you know of any collectors of early Iron Man.

419
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,860
<13-17,MIKE>抱歉  卡塞尔先生
<13-17,MIKE>I'm sorry, Mr. Castle.

<13-18,BECKETT>麦克  你认识这个人吗
<13-18,BECKETT>Mike, do you recognize this man?

422
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,510
<13-19,MIKE>不认识  没印象
<13-19,MIKE>Uh, no. He doesn't look familiar.

423
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,740
<13-20,CASTLE>那么...
<13-20,CASTLE>What about...

424
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,470
<13-20,CASTLE>这个呢
<13-20,CASTLE>This one?

425
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,220
<13-21,MIKE>是的  他我知道
<13-21,MIKE>Yeah, him I know.

426
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,350
<13-22,CASTLE>-你知道  -是的
<13-22,CASTLE>- You do? - Yeah.

427
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,610
<13-23,MIKE>-真的吗  -是啊
<13-23,MIKE>- Really? - Yeah.

428
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,720
<13-24,BECKETT>这剑  这服装  是我们找的"侠士"
<13-24,BECKETT>The sword, the suit-- that's our vigilante.

429
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,970
<13-24,BECKETT>《孤胆仇侠》
<13-24,BECKETT>Lone Vengeance,

430
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,240
<13-25,CASTLE>这解释了他在托尼·沃迪尼背上刻的"L"
<13-25,CASTLE>that explains the "L" he carved into Tony Valtini's backside,

431
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,070
<13-25,CASTLE>但我怎么就从没看过《孤胆仇侠之剑》呢
<13-25,CASTLE>but "Sword of Lone Vengeance," How come I've never seen this?

432
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,240
<13-26,MIKE>这个只能在网上阅读
<13-26,MIKE>Oh, it's online only.

433
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
<13-26,MIKE>它没那么主流  但还是有粉丝的
<13-26,MIKE>It's kind of fringe, but it has a following.

434
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,510
<13-26,MIKE>是个叫肖恩·埃尔特的家伙画的
<13-26,MIKE>A guy named Sean Elt writes it.

435
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,220
<13-27,BECKETT>看来你对凶手的扮相
<13-27,BECKETT>Looks like you put more thought

436
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,710
<13-27,BECKETT>花的心思比他自己还多呢  卡塞尔
<13-27,BECKETT>into the killer's costume than he did, Castle.

437
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,940
<13-27,BECKETT>是从漫画上直接抄袭来的
<13-27,BECKETT>It's a direct copy out of the comic book.

438
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,730
<13-28,CASTLE>我见过那个
<13-28,CASTLE>I've seen that before.

439
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,160
<13-29,BECKETT>指节护盾吗  在哪
<13-29,BECKETT>The knuckle plates, where?

440
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,270
<13-30,CASTLE>犯罪现场的地上
<13-30,CASTLE>On the ground at the crime scene.

441
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,130
<13-30,CASTLE>我以为是颗扣子  原来是这东西
<13-30,CASTLE>I thought it was a button, but this is it.

442
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,390
<13-30,CASTLE>指节护盾从凶手的套装上脱落了
<13-30,CASTLE>That's what it was. It fell off of his suit.

443
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,470
<13-30,CASTLE>如果我们能找到那个
<13-30,CASTLE>If we can find that,

444
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,070
<13-30,CASTLE>如果它还在那  说不定能借此追查到凶手
<13-30,CASTLE>if it's still there, it could lead us to the killer.

445
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,290
<14-1,RYAN>巡警们已经扩大排查范围了
<14-1,RYAN>Uniforms widened their canvass.

446
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,640
<14-1,RYAN>还是找不到任何认识这个神秘人的人
<14-1,RYAN>Still can't find anyone who knows our mystery man.

447
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,070
<14-2,ESPOSITO>是啊  无论这家伙是谁  我尚未发现
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, whoever he is, I can't connect him

448
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,440
<14-2,ESPOSITO>他与任何刀剑有关联
<14-2,ESPOSITO>to any swords either.

449
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,890
<14-2,ESPOSITO>我祈祷我们能尽快找到他
<14-2,ESPOSITO>I pray we nail this dude

450
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,630
<14-2,ESPOSITO>省的我给那张名单上每家店打电话了
<14-2,ESPOSITO>before I have to call every store on that list.

451
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,000
<14-3,RYAN>我以为你挺这家伙呢
<14-3,RYAN>Thought you were kind of rooting for this guy.

452
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,120
<14-4,ESPOSITO>之前我以为他是个行侠仗义的好公民
<14-4,ESPOSITO>That's when he was Joe citizen taking it to the bad guys.

453
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,510
<14-4,ESPOSITO>结果他不过是一个穿紧身衣的二货
<14-4,ESPOSITO>Now he's just some nimrod in a suit.

454
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,900
<14-5,RYAN>但他的精神还是值得称赞的啊
<14-5,RYAN>You gotta give him props for spirit, though, right?

455
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,940
<14-5,RYAN>难道你从没做过成为超级英雄的白日梦吗
<14-5,RYAN>I mean, haven't you ever wanted to be a superhero?

456
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,100
<14-5,RYAN>神出鬼没  飞檐走壁
<14-5,RYAN>Going out there, prowling the city,

457
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,330
<14-5,RYAN>行侠仗义
<14-5,RYAN>knocking some heads?

458
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,690
<14-6,ESPOSITO>那就是我现在的工作  是的  我在听
<14-6,ESPOSITO>I do that now. Yeah, I'm still here.

459
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,870
<14-6,ESPOSITO>真的吗
<14-6,ESPOSITO>You did?

460
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,560
<14-6,ESPOSITO>什么时候
<14-6,ESPOSITO>When?

461
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,680
<14-6,ESPOSITO>我们马上到
<14-6,ESPOSITO>I'll be right there.

462
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,510
<14-7,ESPOSITO>两小时前杰克当铺售出了一把武士刀
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Jake's pawnshop sold a samurai sword

463
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,860
<14-7,ESPOSITO>给一个男人
<14-7,ESPOSITO>to some guy two hours ago.

464
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,070
<14-7,ESPOSITO>他们说他符合照片上那个人的外貌
<14-7,ESPOSITO>They say he matches our photo of our mystery man.

465
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,820
<14-8,RYAN>也许他是想换掉那把
<14-8,RYAN>Maybe he's replacing the one

466
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,710
<14-8,RYAN>劈开泰勒·法瑞斯时断掉的剑
<14-8,RYAN>he broke off in Tyler Faris.

467
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,650
<15-1,CASTLE>之前...就在这
<15-1,CASTLE>It was... here.

468
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,000
<15-1,CASTLE>我知道它在这儿
<15-1,CASTLE>I know it was here.

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
<15-2,BECKETT>也许被人捡走了吧
<15-2,BECKETT>Well, maybe somebody picked it up.

470
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,110
<15-2,BECKETT>或者那根本就是颗纽扣
<15-2,BECKETT>Or maybe it was a button.

471
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,330
<15-2,BECKETT>不  那是...
<15-2,BECKETT>No, it's--

472
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,600
<15-3,CASTLE>找到了
<15-3,CASTLE>There it is.

473
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,450
<15-3,CASTLE>这可不是纽扣
<15-3,CASTLE>That is no button.

474
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,260
<15-4,CASTLE>这是那服装上的一部分
<15-4,CASTLE>That is a piece of his costume.

475
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,180
<15-4,CASTLE>你是对的
<15-4,CASTLE>You're right.

476
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,760
<15-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我想这上面还残留了部分指纹
<15-5,BECKETT>Castle, I think there's a partial print on it.

481
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,800
<15-6,BECKETT>警察
<15-6,BECKETT>Police!

482
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,920
<15-6,BECKETT>站住
<15-6,BECKETT>Stop!

483
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,390
<15-7,CASTLE>真是酷毙了
<15-7,CASTLE>How cool was that?!

484
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,570
<15-8,BECKETT>哪里酷了  他就是凶手酷
<15-8,BECKETT>Which part, that that was our murderer

485
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,110
<15-8,BECKETT>还是凶手刚刚逃跑了比较酷
<15-8,BECKETT>or that he just got away?

486
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,060
<15-8,BECKETT>我得发个全境通告
<15-8,BECKETT>I gotta call in an APB.

487
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,920
<15-9,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  待会我再打给你
<15-9,BECKETT>Espo, I gotta call you back.

488
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,610
<15-10,ESPOSITO>等等  这个消息你一定喜欢
<15-10,ESPOSITO>Wait. You're gonna want to hear this.

489
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,940
<15-11,BECKETT>我们刚刚和凶手打了照面
<15-11,BECKETT>Yeah, we just saw our suspect.

490
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,310
<15-11,BECKETT>他从案发现场溜了
<15-11,BECKETT>He fled the crime scene.

491
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,110
<15-12,ESPOSITO>我知道在哪能找到他  因为我知道他是谁了
<15-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and I know where to find him because I know who he is.

492
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,530
<15-13,BECKETT>什么  怎么知道的
<15-13,BECKETT>What? How?

493
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,840
<15-14,ESPOSITO>今天他在当铺买了
<15-14,ESPOSITO>Well, he bought a samurai sword

494
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,570
<15-14,ESPOSITO>一把武士刀  而重点是
<15-14,ESPOSITO>at a pawnshop today, and now get this--

495
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:26,960
<15-14,ESPOSITO>他是用支票付的款
<15-14,ESPOSITO>he paid for it with a check.

496
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,220
<15-14,ESPOSITO>他的名字是...
<15-14,ESPOSITO>His name is, uh,

497
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,440
<15-14,ESPOSITO>查德·霍克尼
<15-14,ESPOSITO>Chad Hockney.

498
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,630
<15-14,ESPOSITO>他的照片与案发现场那个
<15-14,ESPOSITO>His photo matches the mystery man

499
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,630
<15-11,BECKETT>神秘人相匹配
<15-11,BECKETT>from the crime scene.

500
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,880
<15-15,BECKETT>他住在哪
<15-15,BECKETT>What's his address?

501
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,020
<16-1,BECKETT>纽约警局  别动
<16-1,BECKETT>NYPD. Do not move a muscle.

502
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,490
<16-2,CASTLE>除非你动起来比子弹还快
<16-2,CASTLE>Unless you can move faster than a speeding bullet.

507
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,180
<16-2,CASTLE>这家伙
<16-2,CASTLE>This man...

508
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,910
<17-1,GATES>他就是凶手吗
<17-1,GATES>He's our killer?

509
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,450
<17-2,CASTLE>但说句公道话
<17-2,CASTLE>Well, to be fair, h--

510
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,080
<17-2,CASTLE>他在暗巷里要牛逼很多...
<17-2,CASTLE>He was a lot more imposing in a dark alley...

511
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,810
<17-3,GATES>还带着把剑
<17-3,GATES>with a sword.

512
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,760
<17-4,BECKETT>是啊  他家离案发现场只有四个街区
<17-4,BECKETT>Yeah, he lives four blocks away from the crime scene,

513
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,510
<17-4,BECKETT>鉴证组此刻正在翻查他的公寓...
<17-4,BECKETT>and CSU is going through his apartment right now to find...

514
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,310
<17-4,BECKETT>在找能将他与凶案相连的证据
<17-4,BECKETT>e-evidence to link him to the murder.

515
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,240
<17-5,GATES>给我处理好了  探长
<17-5,GATES>Tie this up in a bow, detective.

516
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,130
<17-5,GATES>让他认罪
<17-5,GATES>Get me a confession.

517
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,700
<18-1,BECKETT>坐下吧  霍克尼先生
<18-1,BECKETT>Take a seat, Mr. Hockney.

518
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,760
<18-2,CHAD>我想这是个天大的误会
<18-2,CHAD>Uh, look, this is just a big misunderstanding.

519
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,530
<18-2,CHAD>我是站在你们这一边的呀
<18-2,CHAD>I mean, I-I'm on your guys' side here.

520
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,820
<18-3,BECKETT>我们这一边不会处决罪犯
<18-3,BECKETT>Our side doesn't execute criminals.

521
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,010
<18-4,CHAD>对嘛  我也不会呀
<18-4,CHAD>See, yeah, neither do I.

522
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,550
<18-5,CASTLE>除了昨晚的"好汉分两半"
<18-5,CASTLE>Except for last night's episode of "Two half-men."

523
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,760
<18-6,BECKETT>查德  我们有目击证人
<18-6,BECKETT>We have a witness, Chad.

524
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,350
<18-6,BECKETT>她见到你劈了泰勒·法瑞斯
<18-6,BECKETT>She saw you kill Tyler Faris.

525
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,030
<18-7,CASTLE>之后  你又飞蛾扑火一般
<18-7,CASTLE>And then like a moth to a flame,

526
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,500
<18-7,CASTLE>不顾一切地跑回案发现场
<18-7,CASTLE>you were inexorably drawn back to the scene of the crime.

527
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,510
<18-8,BECKETT>正是此时你意识到自己落下了套装的一部分
<18-8,BECKETT>Which is when you realized you lost part of your suit.

528
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,790
<18-8,BECKETT>所以又回去找护盾
<18-8,BECKETT>So you came back to get it,

529
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,700
<18-8,BECKETT>或者说  是从我们手里夺走了
<18-8,BECKETT>or rather, take it from us.

530
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,080
<18-9,CASTLE>这都是为了你父亲  对吗
<18-9,CASTLE>This is all about your father, isn't it?

531
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,130
<18-9,CASTLE>他的死驱使你复仇
<18-9,CASTLE>You're driven by his death?

532
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,970
<18-10,CHAD>我爸爸在迈阿密
<18-10,CHAD>My father's in Miami.

533
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,510
<18-10,CHAD>我不知道你们在胡扯些什么
<18-10,CHAD>I-I don't know what you people are talking about.

534
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,690
<18-11,BECKETT>那么你是说  你没有在暗巷里
<18-11,BECKETT>So you're saying, you weren't in the alley

535
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,070
<18-11,BECKETT>用剑敲我的手
<18-11,BECKETT>slapping my hand with your sword,

536
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,550
<18-11,BECKETT>也没有杀泰勒·法瑞斯
<18-11,BECKETT>and you didn't kill Tyler Faris?

537
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,230
<18-12,CHAD>没有  我永远不会杀人的
<18-12,CHAD>No. I-I would never kill anyone.

538
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,630
<18-12,CHAD>孤胆仇侠也不会的
<18-12,CHAD>I mean, n-neither would Lone Vengeance.

539
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,750
<18-13,BECKETT>你不是孤胆仇侠吗
<18-13,BECKETT>Aren't you Lone Vengeance?

540
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,880
<18-14,CHAD>不是本尊
<18-14,CHAD>Not the real one.

541
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,220
<18-15,CASTLE>本尊是漫画里的角色吗
<18-15,CASTLE>The real one being the comic book character?

542
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,580
<18-16,CHAD>漫画里的角色不是真的
<18-16,CHAD>Comic book characters aren't real.

543
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,600
<18-16,CHAD>好吗
<18-16,CHAD>Okay?

544
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,470
<18-17,CHAD>我说的是那个扮成
<18-17,CHAD>I mean the guy who assumed the persona

545
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,060
<18-17,CHAD>漫画角色的人
<18-17,CHAD>of the comic book character.

546
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,800
<18-19,CHAD>-那是谁呢  -没人知道
<18-19,CHAD>- And who is that? - No one knows.

547
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,160
<18-19,CHAD>但他是超级英雄圈的传奇
<18-19,CHAD>But he is a legend in the Superhero Community.

548
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,120
<18-19,CHAD>我做赤红侠的时候就梦想能成为他
<18-19,CHAD>I dreamed of being him when I was Red Marune.

549
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,200
<18-20,CASTLE>"保护众生  不偏不倚"
<18-20,CASTLE>"Protector of all, beholding to none"?

550
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,490
<18-21,CHAD>你听说过我
<18-21,CHAD>You've heard of me?

551
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,300
<18-22,BECKETT>我们看过那个抢包的视频
<18-22,BECKETT>We saw the purse-snatching video.

552
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,820
<18-22,BECKETT>是吗
<18-22,BECKETT>Yeah...

553
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,040
<18-23,CHAD>那个啊
<18-23,CHAD>That.

554
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,610
<18-23,CHAD>那视频一上网
<18-23,CHAD>That hit the web

555
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,880
<18-23,CHAD>差不多就把赤红侠变成了个笑话
<18-23,CHAD>and pretty much turned Red Marune into a joke.

556
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,470
<18-23,CHAD>那段日子真是不堪回首
<18-23,CHAD>Those were dark days.

557
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,020
<18-23,CHAD>本来我已经打算退隐江湖
<18-23,CHAD>I was about ready to hang up my tights for good,

558
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,550
<18-23,CHAD>但后来又决定去向孤胆仇侠寻求意见
<18-23,CHAD>but then I decided to seek out Lone Vengeance's counsel.

559
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,000
<18-24,CASTLE>他说了什么
<18-24,CASTLE>What did he say?

560
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,590
<18-25,CHAD>让我离他远点儿
<18-25,CHAD>To stay the hell away from him.

561
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,160
<18-25,CHAD>但那  却坚定了我的信念
<18-25,CHAD>But that--that only steeled my resolve.

562
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,400
<18-25,CHAD>我做了这套服装  买了剑
<18-25,CHAD>I mean, I made this costume, I-I got a sword.

563
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,350
<18-25,CHAD>你们破门而入时  我正准备出门巡逻
<18-25,CHAD>I was about to go out on patrol when you guys busted in.

564
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,430
<18-26,BECKETT>你是怎么找到他的
<18-26,BECKETT>How do you find him?

565
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,540
<18-27,CHAD>我听说孤胆仇侠常常在南曼哈顿区出现
<18-27,CHAD>I-I heard that Lone Vengeance, uh, frequented lower Manhattan.

566
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,610
<18-27,CHAD>我夜夜在街上晃悠  希望能找到他
<18-27,CHAD>I-I roamed the streets night after night looking for him.

567
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,710
<18-27,CHAD>有天终于遇见他了
<18-27,CHAD>I finally ran into him, uh...

568
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,940
<18-27,CHAD>在比克曼街和剧院巷附近
<18-27,CHAD>Near Beekman and Theatre Alley.

569
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,750
<18-27,CHAD>我想让他收我为徒
<18-27,CHAD>I want to be his disciple.

570
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,110
<18-27,CHAD>或许
<18-27,CHAD>Maybe...

571
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,180
<18-27,CHAD>做他的搭档
<18-27,CHAD>his partner.

572
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,100
<18-27,CHAD>那是我的使命
<18-27,CHAD>It's--it's my destiny.

573
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,730
<18-28,CASTLE>他不想要搭档
<18-28,CASTLE>He doesn't want a partner.

574
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,400
<18-29,CHAD>你怎么知道
<18-29,CHAD>How do you know?

575
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,500
<18-30,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠
<18-30,CASTLE>Lone Vengeance.

576
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,740
<18-30,CASTLE>"孤胆"
<18-30,CASTLE>"Lone."

577
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,740
<19-1,GATES>没法对他立案是什么意思
<19-1,GATES>What do you mean, you can't make a case against him?

578
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,950
<19-1,GATES>他的装束和凶手一样
<19-1,GATES>He's wearing the same suit.

579
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,890
<19-2,BECKETT>是的  可很显然穿一样装束的不只他一个人
<19-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, apparently, he's not the only one.

580
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,770
<19-2,BECKETT>凶案发生当晚
<19-2,BECKETT>Chad Hockney was in his apartment

581
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,950
<19-2,BECKETT>查德·霍克尼正在自己家做那套衣服
<19-2,BECKETT>making that suit the night of the murder.

582
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,230
<19-2,BECKETT>事实上  当时邻居抱怨过
<19-2,BECKETT>In fact, neighbors were complaining

583
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,620
<19-2,BECKETT>缝纫机发出的噪音
<19-2,BECKETT>about the noise from the sewing machine.

584
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,350
<19-3,GATES>我告诉市长我们抓到凶手了
<19-3,GATES>I told the mayor we had our man.

585
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,910
<19-4,BECKETT>你不该告诉他的
<19-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you shouldn't have done that.

586
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,700
<19-5,GATES>或许我是不该
<19-5,GATES>Perhaps what I shouldn't have done

587
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,060
<19-5,GATES>相信你  探长
<19-5,GATES>was place my faith in you, detective.

588
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,200
<20-1,BECKETT>伙计们  摩托车查得怎么样了
<20-1,BECKETT>Guys, where are we on the motorcycle?

589
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,290
<20-2,ESPOSITO>正在查银色川崎摩托的注册登记
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Checking registrations on silver Kawasakis.

590
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,940
<20-3,RYAN>我们还在比克曼街附近寻找
<20-3,RYAN>We're also canvassing around Beekman

591
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,230
<20-3,RYAN>其他见到过孤胆仇侠的人
<20-3,RYAN>for other sightings of Lone Vengeance.

592
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,520
<20-4,BECKETT>申请法院令
<20-4,BECKETT>Okay, let's put in a court order

593
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,070
<20-4,BECKETT>调出所有下载过
<20-4,BECKETT>for the names of all of the people

594
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,120
<20-4,BECKETT>《孤胆仇侠》漫画的人的名单
<20-4,BECKETT>who downloaded the Lone Vengeance comics.

595
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,810
<20-4,BECKETT>凶手可能就在其中
<20-4,BECKETT>One of them might be our murderer.

596
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,260
<21-1,CASTLE>你初涉世事
<21-1,CASTLE>To the untrained eye,

597
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,400
<21-1,CASTLE>可能以为我老大不小还看漫画  但是...
<21-1,CASTLE>this might look like a grown man reading comic books, but--

598
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,070
<21-2,ALEXIS>爸  我一直在想
<21-2,ALEXIS>I've been thinking about this, dad.

599
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
<21-2,ALEXIS>我觉得你该为我感到高兴
<21-2,ALEXIS>I think you should be happy for me.

600
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,760
<21-3,CASTLE>我很高兴
<21-3,CASTLE>I am.

601
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,170
<21-3,CASTLE>我为你高兴  我只是会想念你  仅此而已
<21-3,CASTLE>I am. I'm just gonna miss you, that's all.

602
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,760
<21-4,ALEXIS>我也是
<21-4,ALEXIS>Me, too.

603
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,300
<21-4,ALEXIS>可这是我想要的
<21-4,ALEXIS>But this is what I want.

604
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,230
<21-5,CASTLE>过来  给我说说你的课程
<21-5,CASTLE>Come. Tell me about your classes.

605
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,270
<21-5,CASTLE>你一月上什么课
<21-5,CASTLE>What will you be taking in January?

606
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,030
<21-6,ALEXIS>统计学入门
<21-6,ALEXIS>Uh, Intro to Statistics,

607
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,540
<21-6,ALEXIS>微观经济学理论
<21-6,ALEXIS>Microeconomic Theory,

608
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,070
<21-6,ALEXIS>伊斯兰中东经济学理论...
<21-6,ALEXIS>The Economic Theory of the Islamic Middle East--

609
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,640
<21-7,CASTLE>阿什利才是学经济专业的啊  你...
<21-7,CASTLE>Isn't Ashley an economics major? D--

610
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,080
<21-7,CASTLE>难道说你选了跟他一样的课吗
<21-7,CASTLE>Are you just taking his classes?

611
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,080
<21-8,ALEXIS>那样的话  我们就能多点时间在一起
<21-8,ALEXIS>That way, we can spend more time together.

612
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,030
<21-8,ALEXIS>有什么不妥吗
<21-8,ALEXIS>What's wrong with that?

613
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,180
<21-9,CASTLE>引用蜘蛛侠名言
<21-9,CASTLE>To quote Spider-Man,

614
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,750
<21-9,CASTLE>"能力越大  责任越大"
<21-9,CASTLE>"With great power comes great responsibility."

615
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,460
<21-9,CASTLE>不是所有人都有机会
<21-9,CASTLE>Not a lot of people get a chance

616
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,160
<21-9,CASTLE>上这么好的学校
<21-9,CASTLE>to go to a school like this.

617
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,560
<21-9,CASTLE>你得考虑你自己的梦想
<21-9,CASTLE>You need to think about your dreams

618
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,140
<21-9,CASTLE>和你自己的需求
<21-9,CASTLE>and what you want.

619
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,850
<21-10,ALEXIS>这就是我的需求
<21-10,ALEXIS>This is what I want.

620
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,440
<21-11,CASTLE>这是阿什利的需求
<21-11,CASTLE>This is what Ashley wants.

621
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,370
<21-12,ALEXIS>这都不是他的主意  是我的
<21-12,ALEXIS>This wasn't even his idea. It was mine.

622
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,340
<21-13,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  你不能满脑子都是阿什利
<21-13,CASTLE>Well, this can't be all about Ashley, Alexis.

623
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,910
<21-13,CASTLE>如果你们俩分手了怎么办  到时怎么办
<21-13,CASTLE>I mean, what if you guys break up? What then?

624
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,900
<21-14,ALEXIS>我们不会分手的
<21-14,ALEXIS>We're not gonna break up.

625
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,530
<21-14,ALEXIS>你为什么要劝我放弃
<21-14,ALEXIS>Why are you trying to talk me outta this?

626
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,100
<21-14,ALEXIS>我没有  我...
<21-14,ALEXIS>I'm not. I'm...

627
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,560
<21-15,CASTLE>我不想你草率地做决定
<21-15,CASTLE>I'm just trying to stop you from making irrational choices.

628
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,170
<21-16,ALEXIS>为什么我做的每件事都要合情合理
<21-16,ALEXIS>Why does everything I do have to make sense?

629
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,100
<21-16,ALEXIS>难道我就不能随意而为一次吗
<21-16,ALEXIS>Why can't I just do what I want every once in a while?

630
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,000
<21-16,ALEXIS>你做事可从来都是那样
<21-16,ALEXIS>That's all you ever do.

631
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,350
<22-1,BECKETT>你好
<22-1,BECKETT>Hi.

632
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,620
<22-2,CASTLE>我该先打电话来的
<22-2,CASTLE>I should've-- I should've called.

633
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,890
<22-3,BECKETT>瑜伽  卡塞尔  我在做瑜伽
<22-3,BECKETT>Yoga, Castle. I was doing... yoga.

634
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,390
<22-4,CASTLE>-快进来  -好
<22-4,CASTLE>- Come on in. - Gotcha.

635
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,930
<22-5,CASTLE>我有发现  会让你大跌眼镜
<22-5,CASTLE>I found something that will shock and amaze you.

636
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,560
<22-5,CASTLE>我下载了《孤胆仇侠》全集
<22-5,CASTLE>I downloaded all of the "Sword of Lone Vengeances."

637
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,460
<22-6,BECKETT>这可没让我大跌眼镜
<22-6,BECKETT>That's not shocking or amazing.

638
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,330
<22-7,CASTLE>听我说完
<22-7,CASTLE>You didn't let me finish.

639
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,600
<22-7,CASTLE>我一直在这些漫画中
<22-7,CASTLE>I was looking for clues as to the killer's identity

640
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,600
<22-7,CASTLE>寻找凶手身份的线索
<22-7,CASTLE>in the comic books.

641
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,340
<22-7,CASTLE>没有收获  但我找到了这个
<22-7,CASTLE>I didn't find any, but check out what I did find.

642
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,040
<22-7,CASTLE>看看这几幅图
<22-7,CASTLE>Take a look at these panels.

643
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,280
<22-7,CASTLE>一名暴徒走出他的仓库  孤胆仇侠出现
<22-7,CASTLE>A hoodlum leaves his warehouse, uh, Lone Vengeance swoops in,

644
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,680
<22-7,CASTLE>然后在他的右屁屁刻上了字母"L"
<22-7,CASTLE>and then carves the letter "L" in his right cheek.

645
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,810
<22-7,CASTLE>这让你想到了谁
<22-7,CASTLE>Who does that remind you of?

646
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,720
<22-8,BECKETT>屠夫托尼
<22-8,BECKETT>Tony the Butcher.

647
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,370
<22-9,CASTLE>我查了这本的出版日期
<22-9,CASTLE>I checked the dates on the issue.

648
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,350
<22-9,CASTLE>是在孤胆仇侠袭击他之后出版的
<22-9,CASTLE>It came out after Lone Vengeance attacked him.

649
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,460
<22-9,CASTLE>漫画重现了这次事件
<22-9,CASTLE>These panels emulate that event.

650
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,060
<22-9,CASTLE>唯一在场的人就是那位"侠士"
<22-9,CASTLE>The only other person who was there was our vigilante.

651
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,190
<22-10,BECKETT>-你是说...  -一定是这样
<22-10,BECKETT>- So then you're saying that... - It has to be.

652
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,560
<22-11,CASTLE>凶手就是这漫画的作者
<22-11,CASTLE>Our killer is the writer of this comic book--

653
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,030
<23-1,BECKETT>肖恩·埃尔特
<23-1,BECKETT>Sean Elt.

654
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,310
<23-1,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<23-1,BECKETT>Okay, thank you.

655
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,610
<23-1,BECKETT>没肖恩·埃尔特这个人
<23-1,BECKETT>Sean Elt doesn't exist.

656
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,090
<23-1,BECKETT>这是个化名
<23-1,BECKETT>His name is an alias.

657
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,190
<23-2,CASTLE>我们作家管这个叫笔名[法语]
<23-2,CASTLE>Or a nom de plume as we writers say.

658
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,890
<23-2,CASTLE>但怎会有人选肖恩·埃尔特...
<23-2,CASTLE>Though why anyone would choose "Sean Elt"...

659
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,630
<23-2,CASTLE>等等
<23-2,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

660
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,290
<23-2,CASTLE>这是个乱序词
<23-2,CASTLE>It's an anagram.

661
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,030
<23-2,CASTLE>重新组合一下  就成了
<23-2,CASTLE>Change the letters around, and you get...

662
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,830
<23-3,BECKETT>斯坦·李  漫画大师
<23-3,BECKETT>Stan Lee-- comic book genius.

664
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,170
<23-4,CASTLE>相信我  他绝不是斯坦·李
<23-4,CASTLE>Trust me, he is no Stan Lee.

665
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
<23-4,CASTLE>连肖恩·埃尔特都不是
<23-4,CASTLE>He's not even Sean Elt.

666
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,140
<23-5,RYAN>好的  谢谢  比尔  下次吧
<23-5,RYAN>Yeah, all right. Thanks, Bill. Maybe next time.

667
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,610
<23-6,RYAN>技术部门查不到他的真名
<23-6,RYAN>All right. So no help from tech on the real name.

668
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,670
<23-6,RYAN>孤胆仇侠网站是由肖恩·埃尔特一个人注册的
<23-6,RYAN>The Lone Vengeance web site is registered solely to Sean Elt.

669
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,140
<23-7,ESPOSITO>不管是谁
<23-7,ESPOSITO>Well, whoever he is,

670
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,080
<23-7,ESPOSITO>被他写进漫画的不止屠夫托尼一个人
<23-7,ESPOSITO>he put more than Tony the butcher in his comics.

671
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,110
<23-7,ESPOSITO>我还发现另两件现实中发生的事件
<23-7,ESPOSITO>I found two more real-life incidents

672
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,680
<23-7,ESPOSITO>被写进了漫画情节
<23-7,ESPOSITO>that wound up as storylines.

673
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,820
<23-7,ESPOSITO>孤胆仇侠端掉了毒贩窝点
<23-7,ESPOSITO>Lone Vengeance shook down a drug dealer,

674
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,420
<23-7,ESPOSITO>这里他点着了一辆装满平板电视的卡车
<23-7,ESPOSITO>And here, he set a truck full of flat screens on fire.

675
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,060
<23-8,BECKETT>调出那两份警方报告
<23-8,BECKETT>Okay, pull up the two police reports.

676
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,730
<23-8,BECKETT>-看有什么共同点  -这就去
<23-8,BECKETT>- Let's see if they have anything in common. - I'm on it.

677
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,060
<23-10,BECKETT>谢了
<23-10,BECKETT>Thanks.

678
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,530
<23-11,CASTLE>事情说不通啊
<23-11,CASTLE>Something doesn't add up.

679
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,660
<23-11,CASTLE>不论在漫画中还是现实中
<23-11,CASTLE>Lone Vengeance stamps out crime,

680
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,230
<23-11,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠都在打击犯罪
<23-11,CASTLE>both in the comics and in real life.

681
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,140
<23-11,CASTLE>他很喜欢行侠仗义
<23-11,CASTLE>He's into this vigilante-style ass kicking,

682
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,470
<23-11,CASTLE>托尼那次还屁股刻字
<23-11,CASTLE>or in Tony's case, ass carving,

683
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,240
<23-11,CASTLE>可他从不杀人
<23-11,CASTLE>but never murder.

684
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,380
<23-11,CASTLE>那他为何突然要杀了泰勒·法瑞斯呢
<23-11,CASTLE>So why would he suddenly kill Tyler Faris,

685
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,280
<23-11,CASTLE>又为何要用这么残暴的方式呢
<23-11,CASTLE>and why in such a brutal way?

686
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,580
<23-12,BECKETT>《孤胆仇侠之剑: 这次是私人恩怨》
<23-12,BECKETT>The "Sword of Lone Vengeance: This time it's personal"?

687
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,080
<23-13,CASTLE>只可能是这样
<23-13,CASTLE>That has to be it.

688
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,220
<23-13,CASTLE>泰勒·法瑞斯一定认识肖恩·埃尔特
<23-13,CASTLE>Tyler Faris must have known Sean Elt.

689
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,220
<23-13,CASTLE>据我所知  他不认识
<23-13,CASTLE>He didn't as best as I recall.

690
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,260
<23-13,CASTLE>我从没听说过肖恩·埃尔特
<23-13,CASTLE>I never heard of no Sean Elt.

691
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,760
<24-1,BECKETT>你儿子跟漫画迷有接触吗
<24-1,BECKETT>Did your son ever hang out with the comic book crowd?

692
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,640
<24-1,BECKETT>他喜欢漫画吗
<24-1,BECKETT>Was he into comics?

693
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,230
<23-9,ESPOSITO>他只喜欢放荡学生妹那种
<23-9,ESPOSITO>Just those slutty schoolgirl ones.

694
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,230
<23-10,BECKETT>可最近  他完全迷上了...
<23-10,BECKETT>Oh, but lately, he had gotten all into--

695
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,470
<23-11,CASTLE>是什么来着
<23-11,CASTLE>Oh, what was it? Uh...

696
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,070
<23-12,BECKETT>《孤胆仇侠之剑》
<23-12,BECKETT>Uh, "Sword of Lone Vengeance."

697
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,340
<24-2,BECKETT>他提到过那漫画的作者吗
<24-2,BECKETT>Did he ever mention the writer of that comic?

698
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,070
<24-2,BECKETT>他最近有没有跟和以往不同的人来往
<24-2,BECKETT>Was he hanging out with anyone out of the ordinary lately?

699
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,740
<24-3,CASTLE>比如说斯文人
<24-3,CASTLE>Somebody mild-mannered, perhaps?

700
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,380
<24-3,CASTLE>事实上  几天前我看见
<24-3,CASTLE>Actually, I saw him talking

701
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,650
<24-4,CASTLE>他站在门廊和一个人说话
<24-4,CASTLE>on the stoop to a guy a few days back.

702
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,820
<24-4,CASTLE>他不太一样  穿着套装
<24-4,CASTLE>He was different. Wore a suit.

703
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,280
<24-4,CASTLE>面具斗篷那种吗
<24-4,CASTLE>As in mask and cape?

704
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,550
<24-4,CASTLE>西装革履那种
<24-4,CASTLE>Jacket and tie.

705
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,750
<24-4,CASTLE>我听到泰勒说
<24-4,CASTLE>I overheard Tyler saying,

706
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,490
<24-5,BECKETT>"我知道真相  我知道你的底细"
<24-5,BECKETT>"I know the truth. I know who you really are."

707
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,420
<24-5,BECKETT>能形容一下他的模样吗
<24-5,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe him?

708
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,660
<24-6,CASTLE>金发年轻人  还留着胡子
<24-6,CASTLE>Uh, fair-haired, youngish, with a beard.

709
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,060
<24-6,CASTLE>还别着那种塑料身份卡
<24-6,CASTLE>Oh, and he wore one of them plastic I.D. cards--

710
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
<24-7,BECKETT>一张绿色的
<24-7,BECKETT>A-a green one.

711
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,270
<24-6,CASTLE>金发  留胡子
<24-6,CASTLE>Fair hair with a beard.

712
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,630
<24-7,BECKETT>绿色的记者证
<24-7,BECKETT>A green press badge.

713
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,500
<24-7,BECKETT>罪案现场的那个记者
<24-7,BECKETT>The reporter from the crime scene.

714
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,510
<25-1,RYAN>嫌犯是个叫保罗·惠特克的人
<25-1,RYAN>Our suspect is one Paul Whittaker--

715
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,270
<25-1,RYAN>曾是漫画家  现在为《纽约账报》
<25-1,RYAN>Former graphic artist who works the crime beat

716
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,780
<25-1,RYAN>罪案版写文章做报道
<25-1,RYAN>for the "New York Ledger."

717
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,810
<25-1,RYAN>他没上班也不在家
<25-1,RYAN>He's also a no-show at work and he's not at home, either.

718
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,110
<25-1,RYAN>我们对他做了全面通缉  还监视了他的信用卡
<25-1,RYAN>We put out an A.P.B. and we flagged his credit cards.

719
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,180
<25-2,CASTLE>那就完全说得通了
<25-2,CASTLE>Actually, that makes perfect sense.

720
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,490
<25-2,CASTLE>作为一名罪案记者  保罗会在第一时间
<25-2,CASTLE>As a crime reporter, Paul would see firsthand

721
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
<25-2,CASTLE>看到不法之徒是如何扰乱治安的
<25-2,CASTLE>how lawlessness would ravage a community.

722
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,020
<25-2,CASTLE>这促使他无法单单报道罪案
<25-2,CASTLE>Compelled to do more than just write about it,

723
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,290
<25-2,CASTLE>而是带上面具  穿上紧身衣
<25-2,CASTLE>he would don a mask and form-fitting tights

724
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,790
<25-2,CASTLE>化身孤胆仇侠
<25-2,CASTLE>to become Lone Vengeance.

725
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,130
<25-3,RYAN>可他惩奸除恶的计划遇到了阻挠
<25-3,RYAN>But his plan to purge the streets hit a snag

726
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,970
<25-3,RYAN>因为泰勒·法瑞斯威胁
<25-3,RYAN>when Tyler Faris threatened to reveal

727
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,280
<25-3,RYAN>要曝光他的真实身份
<25-3,RYAN>his secret identity,

728
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,830
<25-3,RYAN>使得孤胆仇侠别无他法
<25-3,RYAN>causing Lone Vengeance to cut him down

729
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,840
<25-3,RYAN>只好将他劈成两截
<25-3,RYAN>in a single, fearsome blow.

730
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,370
<25-4,RYAN>怎么了嘛
<25-4,RYAN>What?

731
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,480
<25-5,CASTLE>徒弟成了大师
<25-5,CASTLE>The student has become the master.

732
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,310
<25-5,CASTLE>至少他努力了
<25-5,CASTLE>Or at least, he tried.

733
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,010
<25-5,CASTLE>事实上  对于一个真正的卡塞尔风理论来说
<25-5,CASTLE>Actually, for a truly Castle-esque theory,

734
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,720
<25-5,CASTLE>必须要考虑周全  密不透风
<25-5,CASTLE>it has to be fully thought through.

735
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,700
<25-6,BECKETT>别扯了
<25-6,BECKETT>Since when?

736
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,880
<25-7,RYAN>我有考虑周全
<25-7,RYAN>I did think it through.

737
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,310
<25-8,CASTLE>真的吗  那泰勒·法瑞斯是怎么知道
<25-8,CASTLE>Really? Then how did Tyler Faris know

738
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,050
<25-8,CASTLE>保罗·惠特克就是孤胆仇侠的
<25-8,CASTLE>that Paul Whittaker was Lone Vengeance?

739
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,120
<25-8,CASTLE>这个交给我
<25-8,CASTLE>I've got that one.

740
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,410
<25-9,ESPOSITO>我刚和《账报》编辑聊过
<25-9,ESPOSITO>I just got off with the "Ledger."

741
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,650
<25-9,ESPOSITO>原来罪案记者保罗·惠特克
<25-9,ESPOSITO>Turns out that our reporter Paul Whittaker

742
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,580
<25-9,ESPOSITO>有一部一次性手机
<25-9,ESPOSITO>has a burner cell phone

743
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,060
<25-9,ESPOSITO>用来和他的线人通话
<25-9,ESPOSITO>that he uses to talk to confidential sources.

744
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,230
<25-9,ESPOSITO>泰勒·法瑞斯拨打的正是这个号码
<25-9,ESPOSITO>It's the same number that Tyler Faris made calls to.

745
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,310
<25-10,CASTLE>就是说法瑞斯是消息提供者或是线人
<25-10,CASTLE>So Faris was a source or a paid informant.

746
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,300
<25-10,CASTLE>他们就是这么认识的
<25-10,CASTLE>So that's how they knew each other.

747
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,600
<25-11,RYAN>也许法瑞斯向保罗提供
<25-11,RYAN>And so maybe Faris was tipping off Paul

748
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,600
<25-11,RYAN>街坊发生犯罪行动的情报
<25-11,RYAN>about crimes going down in the neighborhood

749
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,700
<25-11,RYAN>可出现在罪案现场的总是孤胆仇侠
<25-11,RYAN>but Lone Vengeance kept showing up instead.

750
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,740
<25-11,RYAN>正因为这样  法瑞斯发现
<25-11,RYAN>And that... is how Faris found out

751
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,480
<25-11,RYAN>孤胆仇侠就是保罗
<25-11,RYAN>that Lone Vengeance was actually Paul.

752
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,980
<25-12,CASTLE>他和保罗对峙  威胁要曝光他的身份
<25-12,CASTLE>He confronted Paul, threatened to expose him...

753
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,810
<25-13,BECKETT>保罗·惠特克杀了他来隐瞒自己
<25-13,BECKETT>So Paul Whittaker killed him to hide his identity

754
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,310
<25-13,BECKETT>半吊子超级英雄的身份吗
<25-13,BECKETT>as a half-assed superhero?

756
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,320
<25-15,CASTLE>实际上  这非常符合超级英雄的心理
<25-15,CASTLE>Actually, it's perfect superhero psychology.

757
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,720
<25-15,CASTLE>一种共生关系
<25-15,CASTLE>It's symbiosis.

758
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,290
<25-15,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠是保罗·惠特克的一部分
<25-15,CASTLE>See, Lone Vengeance is a part of Paul Whittaker.

759
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,730
<25-15,CASTLE>正如阴阳  互为因果  互为依赖
<25-15,CASTLE>Yin and Yang--one can't exist without the other.

760
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,260
<25-16,BECKETT>封锁那片区域
<25-16,BECKETT>Okay, seal off the area.

761
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,100
<25-17,BECKETT>保罗·惠特克刚刚在第71街与第7街交汇的
<25-17,BECKETT>Paul Whittaker just maxed out his ATM

762
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,270
<25-17,BECKETT>自动提款机透支了
<25-17,BECKETT>at 71st and 7th.

763
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,270
<25-18,CASTLE>离漫画世界只有一个街区
<25-18,CASTLE>That is one block away from Comicadia.

764
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,240
<26-1,MIKE>所有这些只要两千吗
<26-1,MIKE>2 grand for all this?

765
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,480
<26-1,MIKE>老兄  这是《绿巨人》第181期
<26-1,MIKE>Man, you got a "Hulk" 181 here.

767
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,010
<26-1,MIKE>光这一本就有...
<26-1,MIKE>That alone is worth, like--

768
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,880
<26-2,PAUL>赶紧给我钱
<26-2,PAUL>I just need the money...

769
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,490
<26-2,PAUL>要现金
<26-2,PAUL>I-in cash.

770
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,290
<26-3,PAUL>我这会儿有急事
<26-3,PAUL>Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry here

771
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,120
<26-3,PAUL>-所以...  -真的吗
<26-3,PAUL>- so, uh... - Really?

772
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,890
<26-4,BECKETT>你急着要去哪  惠特克先生
<26-4,BECKETT>Where are you off to, Mr. Whittaker?

773
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,660
<26-5,CASTLE>还是应该叫你
<26-5,CASTLE>Or should we say

774
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,330
<26-5,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠
<26-5,CASTLE>Lone Vengeance?

775
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,210
<27-1,GATES>真的吗  凶手是个作家
<27-1,GATES>Really? Our killer's a writer?

776
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,730
<27-2,CASTLE>作家也可以是实干家啊
<27-2,CASTLE>Well, writers can be men of action.

777
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,100
<27-3,GATES>我可没见识过  卡塞尔先生
<27-3,GATES>I've yet to see that, Mr. Castle.

778
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,270
<27-4,GATES>他就像彼特·帕克一样  是个记者
<27-4,GATES>So he's a journalist, like Peter Parker?

780
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,500
<27-5,BECKETT>事实上  彼特·帕克是位新闻摄影师
<27-5,BECKETT>Actually, Peter Parker was a news photographer.

781
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,140
<27-6,CASTLE>而这位更像是克拉克·肯特
<27-6,CASTLE>Yeah, our guy's a little more like, Clark Kent.

783
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,170
<27-6,CASTLE>他是个斯文人  正如...
<27-6,CASTLE>And he's mild-mannered, just like I...

784
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,280
<27-6,CASTLE>我预料的一样
<27-6,CASTLE>predicted.

785
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,340
<27-6,CASTLE>探长
<27-6,CASTLE>Detective,

786
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,710
<27-7,GATES>我要给市长打电话
<27-7,GATES>I'd like to call the Mayor,

787
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,210
<27-7,GATES>告诉他我们已抓住凶手
<27-7,GATES>let him know that we caught our killer.

788
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,320
<27-7,GATES>最好让他认罪
<27-7,GATES>Try to get a confession this time.

789
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,720
<27-8,BECKETT>遵命  长官
<27-8,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

790
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,850
<27-9,BECKETT>我觉得她开始喜欢你了
<27-9,BECKETT>I think she's warming up to you.

791
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,290
<28-1,BECKETT>我们在搜查你的公寓  保罗
<28-1,BECKETT>We're searching your apartment, Paul.

792
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,990
<28-1,BECKETT>发现了这些画稿
<28-1,BECKETT>We found this artwork there.

793
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,830
<28-1,BECKETT>知道你就是《孤胆仇侠之剑》的作者
<28-1,BECKETT>We know that you were behind "Sword of Lone Vengeance."

794
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,740
<28-2,PAUL>没有哪条法律禁止我画漫画吧
<28-2,PAUL>Well--well, there's no law against that, is there?

795
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,570
<28-3,CASTLE>但你的所作所为可不仅是画漫画
<28-3,CASTLE>Except you took it a lot farther than just making a comic book.

796
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,740
<28-4,BECKETT>过不了多久
<28-4,BECKETT>I mean, it's only a matter of time

797
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:47,270
<28-4,BECKETT>我们就会找到你的行头和凶器
<28-4,BECKETT>before we find the suit and the murder weapon.

798
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,740
<28-5,PAUL>孤胆仇侠代表着正义的力量
<28-5,PAUL>Lone Vengeance stands for all that is good and virtuous,

799
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,440
<28-5,PAUL>是独自与罪恶抗衡的勇士
<28-5,PAUL>an army of one at war against crime,

800
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,010
<28-5,PAUL>是无辜大众的守护者
<28-5,PAUL>a defender of the innocent.

801
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,120
<28-5,PAUL>但那只是我创造的人物形象
<28-5,PAUL>But that's just a-a character I created.

802
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,680
<28-5,PAUL>现实中没有这个人
<28-5,PAUL>It's not someone real.

803
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,620
<28-6,BECKETT>根据记录  去年在一栋废弃的
<28-6,BECKETT>According to this, you were mugged last year

804
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,720
<28-6,BECKETT>居民楼外  你遭到抢劫
<28-6,BECKETT>outside an abandoned tenement building?

805
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,220
<28-7,PAUL>这里是纽约
<28-7,PAUL>Well, it's--it's New York.

806
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,290
<28-7,PAUL>被抢劫很正常
<28-7,PAUL>People--people get mugged.

807
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,090
<28-8,BECKETT>不过那个抢劫者挑错了对象
<28-8,BECKETT>Only the mugger got the worst of it.

808
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,160
<28-8,BECKETT>你不过缝了几针
<28-8,BECKETT>You ended up with a few stitches.

809
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,930
<28-8,BECKETT>抢劫者却重伤住院
<28-8,BECKETT>The mugger ended up in the hospital.

810
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,230
<28-8,BECKETT>当时警察认为你很不合作
<28-8,BECKETT>And the cops say that you were "noncompliant."

811
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,170
<28-9,CASTLE>在每个超级英雄的故事里
<28-9,CASTLE>You know, there's a critical moment

812
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,170
<28-9,CASTLE>都有一个关键时刻
<28-9,CASTLE>in the arc of every superhero,

813
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,590
<28-9,CASTLE>从那一刻起  英雄觉醒了
<28-9,CASTLE>an awakening that transforms him,

814
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,330
<28-9,CASTLE>并从此承担起命运赐予的使命
<28-9,CASTLE>that drives him to embrace his destiny.

815
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,630
<28-9,CASTLE>对于你  这次抢劫便是关键时刻
<28-9,CASTLE>For you, the mugging was that moment.

816
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,930
<28-9,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠在那时诞生了
<28-9,CASTLE>That's when Lone Vengeance was born.

817
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,750
<28-10,BECKETT>而《孤胆仇侠之剑》这部漫画
<28-10,BECKETT>And then you used the "Sword of Lone Vengeance"

818
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,500
<28-10,BECKETT>成为你的除暴日记
<28-10,BECKETT>as your comic book diary.

819
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,260
<28-10,BECKETT>我们知道你杀了泰勒·法瑞斯  保罗
<28-10,BECKETT>We know you killed Tyler Faris, Paul.

820
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,760
<28-10,BECKETT>普通人也好  超级英雄也好  都结束了
<28-10,BECKETT>Your life is over, both of your lives.

821
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,230
<28-10,BECKETT>监狱在等着你
<28-10,BECKETT>You're going to prison.

822
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,030
<28-11,BECKETT>你觉得若你未来的狱友们
<28-11,BECKETT>What do you think those cons are gonna do

823
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,800
<28-11,BECKETT>发现你曾穿着紧身衣以超级英雄自诩  会怎么对你
<28-11,BECKETT>when they find out that you ran around in tights?

824
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,470
<28-11,BECKETT>如果你帮我们省点时间
<28-11,BECKETT>If you help us,

825
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,370
<28-11,BECKETT>如果你主动认罪
<28-11,BECKETT>if you confess,

826
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,620
<28-11,BECKETT>我能保证你的安全
<28-11,BECKETT>I will keep you safe.

827
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,310
<28-11,BECKETT>让你待在隔离监狱中
<28-11,BECKETT>I will get you placed in segregated housing.

828
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,970
<28-11,BECKETT>这协议对你很有利  保罗
<28-11,BECKETT>Now that is a good deal, Paul.

829
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,350
<28-11,BECKETT>我是你的话就会接受
<28-11,BECKETT>I would take it if I were you.

830
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,200
<28-12,PAUL>好吧
<28-12,PAUL>Okay.

831
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,140
<28-12,PAUL>那我说
<28-12,PAUL>Okay. Okay.

832
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,270
<28-12,PAUL>是我干的
<28-12,PAUL>It's me.

833
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,280
<28-13,BECKETT>我就是孤胆仇侠
<28-13,BECKETT>I'm Lone Vengeance.

834
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,780
<28-13,BECKETT>泰勒·法瑞斯发现了吗
<28-13,BECKETT>And Tyler Faris found out?

835
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,960
<28-14,PAUL>是的  他威胁要揭发我
<28-14,PAUL>Yeah. He--he threatened to expose me,

836
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,790
<28-14,PAUL>所以我杀了他
<28-14,PAUL>so I killed him.

837
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,510
<28-15,BECKETT>我需要你写下来  保罗
<28-15,BECKETT>I'm gonna need you to write that down, Paul.

838
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,540
<28-16,CASTLE>你说孤胆仇侠是正义之士
<28-16,CASTLE>You said Lone Vengeance stands for all that is good.

839
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,840
<28-16,CASTLE>他是有准则的人
<28-16,CASTLE>So he has a code.

840
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,640
<28-16,CASTLE>而杀人这种事
<28-16,CASTLE>So killing someone,

841
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,050
<28-16,CASTLE>即便杀的是泰勒·法瑞斯
<28-16,CASTLE>even someone like Tyler Faris,

842
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,740
<28-16,CASTLE>也违背了这一准则
<28-16,CASTLE>violated that code.

843
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,760
<28-16,CASTLE>对于一个典型的超级英雄
<28-16,CASTLE>In a typical superhero,

844
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,940
<28-16,CASTLE>这会让他开始怀疑自己
<28-16,CASTLE>that would trigger a crisis of faith.

845
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,810
<28-16,CASTLE>你当时肯定很矛盾
<28-16,CASTLE>You must have been conflicted.

846
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,110
<28-16,CASTLE>你杀死泰勒·法瑞斯时  有何感觉
<28-16,CASTLE>How did you feel when you killed Tyler Faris?

847
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,550
<28-17,PAUL>我感觉很糟
<28-17,PAUL>Well, I-I felt bad.

848
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,990
<28-17,PAUL>非常糟糕
<28-17,PAUL>I-I felt... really bad.

849
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,290
<28-18,BECKETT>保罗  你在杀死泰勒后
<28-18,BECKETT>Paul, why did you chop off Tyler's hand

850
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,750
<28-18,BECKETT>为何砍下他的手
<28-18,BECKETT>after you killed him?

851
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,330
<28-18,BECKETT>我不知道
<28-18,BECKETT>I don't know.

852
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,000
<28-19,PAUL>鬼使神差吧
<28-19,PAUL>I just--I just did.

853
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,960
<28-19,PAUL>可以让我写认罪书了吗
<28-19,PAUL>Can I--can I write my confession now?

854
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,090
<28-19,PAUL>还有问题吗
<28-19,PAUL>Is--is that okay?

855
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,790
<29-1,RYAN>你确定凶手不是他吗
<29-1,RYAN>Are you sure he didn't do it?

856
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,470
<29-2,BECKETT>不是他  法瑞斯的手是死前砍断的
<29-2,BECKETT>Yeah, Faris' hand was chopped off before he was killed.

857
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,690
<29-2,BECKETT>保罗却不知道
<29-2,BECKETT>Paul didn't know that.

858
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,980
<29-3,ESPOSITO>那他为何要认罪
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Then why did he confess?

859
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,260
<29-4,CASTLE>因为保罗在保护真凶
<29-4,CASTLE>Because Paul is protecting the real killer.

860
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,100
<29-4,CASTLE>保罗是作者  孤胆仇侠是人物原型
<29-4,CASTLE>Paul is the writer. Lone Vengeance is the subject.

861
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,230
<29-4,CASTLE>这就是他们的关系
<29-4,CASTLE>That's their relationship.

862
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,610
<29-4,CASTLE>就像你和我一样
<29-4,CASTLE>It's you and me all over again.

863
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,250
<29-4,CASTLE>我是保罗  你是孤胆仇侠
<29-4,CASTLE>But I'm Paul, and you're Lone Vengeance.

864
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,630
<29-5,BECKETT>真的吗  卡塞尔  你这么看我吗
<29-5,BECKETT>Really, Castle, is that how you see me,

865
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,410
<29-5,BECKETT>挥着剑的杀手
<29-5,BECKETT>like a sword-wielding killer?

866
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,000
<29-6,CASTLE>要看你会不会穿性感的战斗服
<29-6,CASTLE>Depends. Will you be scantily clad?

867
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,620
<29-7,BECKTT>做你的白日梦吧
<29-7,BECKTT>In your dreams.

868
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,210
<29-8,ESPOSITO>不好意思打扰两位的漫画幻想之旅
<29-8,ESPOSITO>Not to rain on your comic book fantasy,

869
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,930
<29-8,ESPOSITO>但如果保罗不是孤胆仇侠
<29-8,ESPOSITO>but if Paul is not Lone Vengeance,

870
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,420
<29-8,ESPOSITO>那他的遇劫案也有了新疑点
<29-8,ESPOSITO>it puts a whole new spin on his mugging.

871
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,440
<29-9,CASTLE>确实如此  我猜抢劫者肯定不是保罗打的
<29-9,CASTLE>That's right, it does. I bet Paul didn't beat up that mugger.

872
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,510
<29-9,CASTLE>应该是孤胆仇侠干的
<29-9,CASTLE>I bet that was Lone Vengeance.

873
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,410
<29-9,CASTLE>他们大概是因此而相识
<29-9,CASTLE>That's probably how they met.

874
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,890
<29-10,BECKETT>等一下  保罗被打劫时
<29-10,BECKETT>Wait a minute. That abandoned tenement building

875
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,350
<29-10,BECKETT>所在的那个废弃居民楼  在哪里来着
<29-10,BECKETT>where Paul was mugged, where is that?

876
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,930
<29-11,ESPOSITO>在比克曼街和剧院巷交口附近
<29-11,ESPOSITO>Near Beekman and Theatre alley.

877
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,890
<29-12,RYAN>那里也是查德·霍克尼
<29-12,RYAN>That's the same place

878
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,440
<29-12,RYAN>碰到孤胆仇侠的地方
<29-12,RYAN>where Chad Hockney found Lone Vengeance.

879
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,990
<29-13,BECKETT>这要么是个巧合
<29-13,BECKETT>So either that's a coincidence...

880
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,810
<29-14,RYAN>要么那就是他活动的地方
<29-14,RYAN>Or that's where he hangs out.

881
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,680
<29-15,CASTLE>废弃的居民楼
<29-15,CASTLE>An abandoned tenement building--

882
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,440
<29-15,CASTLE>作超级英雄的秘密基地  再合适不过
<29-15,CASTLE>perfect place for a superhero lair.

883
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,300
<30-1,CASTLE>你确定是这里吗
<30-1,CASTLE>You sure this is the place?

884
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,020
<30-2,BECKETT>是的  电力公司说
<30-2,BECKETT>Yeah. The power company said that

885
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,870
<30-2,BECKETT>209室是唯一有电的房间
<30-2,BECKETT>Unit 209's the only one with electricity.

886
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,820
<30-2,BECKETT>有人从电线杆上拉的线
<30-2,BECKETT>Somebody tied it up to a pole.

887
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,410
<30-3,CASTLE>如果这也算秘密基地  我得说...
<30-3,CASTLE>Okay, if this is a lair, can I just say...

888
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,130
<30-3,CASTLE>真让人失望啊
<30-3,CASTLE>disappointing?

889
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,590
<30-3,CASTLE>制造神秘气氛的背景灯
<30-3,CASTLE>I mean, where's the mood lighting,

890
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,820
<30-3,CASTLE>装有50把武士刀的玻璃罩都在哪呢
<30-3,CASTLE>the glass case with 50 samurai swords?

891
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,050
<30-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<30-4,BECKETT>Castle.

892
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,390
<30-4,BECKETT>原来如此
<30-4,BECKETT>All right.

893
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,990
<30-5,CASTLE>原来是预算不够的秘密基地
<30-5,CASTLE>It's a modest lair built on a budget.

894
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,790
<30-5,CASTLE>很好奇他还藏了其他什么东西
<30-5,CASTLE>Wonder what else he's got hidden around here.

895
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,900
<30-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特  防火通道有个人
<30-6,ESPOSITO>Beckett, got a guy on the fire escape

896
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,800
<30-6,ESPOSITO>朝你那边去了
<30-6,ESPOSITO>heading your way.

897
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,880
<30-7,BECKETT>应该是他
<30-7,BECKETT>I think it's him.

898
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,610
<30-7,BECKETT>纽约警察  别动
<30-7,BECKETT>NYPD. Do not move.

899
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,450
<30-8,BECKETT>我是你的话  就老老实实的
<30-8,BECKETT>I wouldn't do that if I were you.

900
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,930
<30-8,BECKETT>楼下已被警察包围了
<30-8,BECKETT>There are cops everywhere downstairs.

901
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,260
<30-8,BECKETT>现在慢慢拿下面具
<30-8,BECKETT>Now very slowly take off that mask.

902
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,330
<30-9,BECKETT>黑斯廷警官
<30-9,BECKETT>Officer Hastings?

903
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,640
<30-10,CASTLE>这我可真没想到
<30-10,CASTLE>I did not see that coming.

904
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,560
<31-1,RYAN>你能相信吗  孤胆仇侠
<31-1,RYAN>Can you believe it, Lone Vengeance,

905
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,470
<31-1,RYAN>挥剑杀手竟然是我们中的一员
<31-1,RYAN>sword-wielding killer, ends up being one of our own?

906
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,340
<31-2,ESPOSITO>不好说  说不定她有苦衷
<31-2,ESPOSITO>I don't know. Maybe she had her reasons.

907
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,340
<31-2,ESPOSITO>什么叫"说不定她有苦衷"
<31-2,ESPOSITO>"Maybe she had her reasons"?

908
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,770
<31-3,RYAN>你之前不是说"穿紧身衣的二货"
<31-3,RYAN>What happened to "nimrod in a suit"?

909
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,320
<31-4,ESPOSITO>我之前又不知道是警察干的
<31-4,ESPOSITO>Well, that's before I knew she was a cop.

910
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,570
<32-1,BECKETT>鉴证组正在检查你的衣服  安
<32-1,BECKETT>C.S.U.'s going over your suit, Ann.

911
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,960
<32-1,BECKETT>检查是否有泰勒·法瑞斯的血迹
<32-1,BECKETT>They're looking for Tyler Faris' blood.

912
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,460
<32-2,HASTINGS>他们是找不到的
<32-2,HASTINGS>They won't find any.

913
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,820
<32-3,BECKETT>那是  你当然知道该如何善后
<32-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you would know how to clean it up.

914
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,740
<32-4,HASTINGS>我一直很敬仰你  探长
<32-4,HASTINGS>I always admired you, detective.

915
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,970
<32-4,HASTINGS>你做警察的风格
<32-4,HASTINGS>The kind of cop that you are,

916
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,340
<32-4,HASTINGS>让我想去了解你
<32-4,HASTINGS>it made me want to get to know you.

917
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,870
<32-5,BECKETT>你本来也能成为那样的警察
<32-5,BECKETT>Well, you could've been that kind of a cop.

918
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,450
<32-5,BECKETT>多次获奖  第一等的评估
<32-5,BECKETT>Awards, first-rate evaluation...

919
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,480
<32-5,BECKETT>你为何放弃了呢
<32-5,BECKETT>Why'd you let it go?

920
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,410
<32-6,HASTINGS>我父亲在家附近开了家干洗店
<32-6,HASTINGS>My father owned a dry cleaners in the neighborhood.

921
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,490
<32-6,HASTINGS>被一个小混混
<32-6,HASTINGS>He got held up,

922
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,450
<32-6,HASTINGS>抢劫了
<32-6,HASTINGS>by some junkie, probably.

923
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,750
<32-6,HASTINGS>为了八十块把他打死
<32-6,HASTINGS>Shot dead over 80 bucks.

924
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,870
<32-6,HASTINGS>他下葬后的第二天  我向警校递交了申请
<32-6,HASTINGS>The day after I buried him, I applied to the academy.

925
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,030
<32-7,BECKETT>而之后你决定亲自来执法
<32-7,BECKETT>So then you decided to take the law into your own hands?

926
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,990
<32-7,BECKETT>当警察还不够吗
<32-7,BECKETT>Being a cop wasn't enough?

927
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,810
<32-8,HASTINGS>我爸爸被人杀了  做什么都是不够的
<32-8,HASTINGS>Someone killed my dad. Nothing will ever be enough.

928
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,520
<32-8,HASTINGS>但我现在做的事让我好过了很多
<32-8,HASTINGS>But doing what I do makes me feel better.

929
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,820
<33-1,CASTLE>我们逮捕了安
<33-1,CASTLE>We arrested Ann.

930
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,000
<33-1,CASTLE>我觉得应该告诉你
<33-1,CASTLE>I just thought you should know.

931
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,900
<33-1,CASTLE>你...
<33-1,CASTLE>You're...

932
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,020
<33-2,PAUL>大概在想我为何要认罪
<33-2,PAUL>probably wondering why I confessed, then.

933
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,310
<33-3,CASTLE>因为你爱上她了
<33-3,CASTLE>You're in love with her.

934
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,800
<34-1,BECKETT>你做得过火了  安
<34-1,BECKETT>You crossed the line, Ann.

935
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,970
<34-2,HASTINGS>不要假装我们有什么不同
<34-2,HASTINGS>Don't pretend like we're so different.

936
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,930
<34-3,BECKETT>我们聊聊泰勒·法瑞斯吧
<34-3,BECKETT>Let's talk about Tyler Faris.

937
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,410
<34-5,BECKETT>-你失去了母亲  -这不是我们讨论的重点
<34-5,BECKETT>- Didn't you lose your mom? - We're not here to discuss that.

938
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,930
<34-6,HASTINGS>你不是也一枪打死了那个凶手
<34-6,HASTINGS>Didn't you shoot the guy who killed her

939
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,170
<34-6,HASTINGS>而且就在这间分局里
<34-6,HASTINGS>right here in this precinct?

940
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,070
<34-6,HASTINGS>你挨的那一枪
<34-6,HASTINGS>The bullet that you took,

941
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,970
<34-6,HASTINGS>也跟她的案子有关不是吗
<34-6,HASTINGS>isn't that connected to her murder, too?

942
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,100
<34-6,HASTINGS>外面是这么传的
<34-6,HASTINGS>Because that's the rumor.

943
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,900
<34-7,BECKETT>我跟你不一样
<34-7,BECKETT>I am not like you.

944
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,370
<34-7,BECKETT>我不会把一个大活人砍成两半
<34-7,BECKETT>I didn't chop a man in half.

945
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,220
<34-8,HASTINGS>我也不干这种事
<34-8,HASTINGS>Neither did I.

946
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,870
<34-9,BECKETT>就是你干的  你还让保罗·惠特克
<34-9,BECKETT>Yes, you did, and you've got Paul Whittaker

947
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,490
<34-9,BECKETT>深陷其中  难以自拔
<34-9,BECKETT>so turned around over it,

948
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,630
<34-9,BECKETT>他甚至试图替你顶罪
<34-9,BECKETT>that he tried to confess to your murder.

949
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,230
<34-10,HASTINGS>保罗  他为什么要干这种傻事
<34-10,HASTINGS>Paul? why would he do that?

950
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,950
<34-10,HASTINGS>该死的  我叫他
<34-10,HASTINGS>Damn it. I...I told him

951
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,110
<34-10,HASTINGS>先出城一阵  等我把这事解决了再回来
<34-10,HASTINGS>to leave town until I got this sorted out.

952
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,270
<34-11,BECKETT>你现在算是把这事解决了
<34-11,BECKETT>Well, you got it sorted out now.

953
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,720
<34-12,HASTINGS>泰勒·法瑞斯不是我杀的
<34-12,HASTINGS>I did not kill Tyler Faris.

954
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,770
<34-12,HASTINGS>我看到他的尸体时  把早餐都吐出来了
<34-12,HASTINGS>I threw up my breakfast when I saw that body.

955
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,850
<34-13,BECKETT>你当时就在小巷  安
<34-13,BECKETT>You were in the alley with me, Ann.

956
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,710
<34-13,BECKETT>你抢走了从你服装上掉下来的东西
<34-13,BECKETT>You took that piece from your suit.

957
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,490
<34-14,HASTINGS>那不是我服装上掉下来的  我回去拿那件东西
<34-14,HASTINGS>It wasn't from my suit, and the only reason I wanted it

958
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,400
<34-14,HASTINGS>就是为了找出幕后真凶
<34-14,HASTINGS>was to figure out who's behind this.

959
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,090
<34-15,BECKETT>-你不会指望我相信你的鬼话吧  -这是事实
<34-15,BECKETT>- Do you actually expect me to believe you?  - It's true.

960
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,220
<34-16,HASTINGS>我在现场看到了那个护盾
<34-16,HASTINGS>I saw that disk at the crime scene.

961
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,760
<34-16,HASTINGS>我知道那不是我的
<34-16,HASTINGS>I knew it wasn't mine,

962
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,830
<34-16,HASTINGS>但是我还没来得及把它拿走就被派去排查了
<34-16,HASTINGS>but before I could get it, I got sent off to canvass.

963
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,990
<34-16,HASTINGS>所以我才回去拿
<34-16,HASTINGS>So I came back for it.

964
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,570
<34-16,HASTINGS>没错  是我从你那儿夺走的
<34-16,HASTINGS>And, yes, I took it from you.

965
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,800
<34-17,BECKETT>那你是怎么处置它的呢
<34-17,BECKETT>And what did you do with it?

966
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,280
<34-18,HASTINGS>让我一个在鉴证化验室工作的朋友提取指纹
<34-18,HASTINGS>I had a friend in the crime lab run it for prints.

967
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,550
<34-18,HASTINGS>上面有部分指纹
<34-18,HASTINGS>It came back with a partial,

968
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,480
<34-18,HASTINGS>但在刑事数据库里没能搜到
<34-18,HASTINGS>but it wasn't in the criminal database.

969
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,440
<34-18,HASTINGS>你不信我  就去问我朋友  东西还在他那儿
<34-18,HASTINGS>Look, if you don't believe me, ask him. He still has it.

970
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,930
<34-19,BECKETT>你是说  是其他人假扮成孤胆仇侠
<34-19,BECKETT>So somebody else dressed up as Lone Vengeance

971
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,200
<34-19,BECKETT>并杀了死者吗
<34-19,BECKETT>and killed our victim?

972
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,800
<34-20,HASTINGS>这是唯一的解释了
<34-20,HASTINGS>It's the only thing that makes sense.

973
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,190
<34-21,BECKETT>这算什么解释啊
<34-21,BECKETT>How does that make sense?

974
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,960
<34-22,HASTINGS>因为人不是我杀的
<34-22,HASTINGS>Because it wasn't me.

975
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,720
<34-22,HASTINGS>我在马特酒吧进行排查的时候查到点东西
<34-22,HASTINGS>I came across something when I canvassed Matt's bar

976
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,370
<34-22,HASTINGS>泰勒·法瑞斯当晚是从那儿出来的
<34-22,HASTINGS>where Tyler Faris came from.

977
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,880
<34-22,HASTINGS>泰勒·法瑞斯行动很有规律
<34-22,HASTINGS>He was a creature of habit.

978
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,320
<34-22,HASTINGS>他每晚都去那家酒吧喝酒
<34-22,HASTINGS>He drank there every night.

979
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,210
<34-22,HASTINGS>他总是在凌晨一点至两点间离开
<34-22,HASTINGS>He'd always leave between 1:00 and 2:00

980
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,230
<34-22,HASTINGS>每次都走酒吧的后门进入小巷
<34-22,HASTINGS>and take the back door to the alley,

981
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,060
<34-22,HASTINGS>而且通常都带走一个姑娘
<34-22,HASTINGS>usually with a girl.

982
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,900
<34-23,BECKETT>所以你是说凶手知道
<34-23,BECKETT>So you're saying that the killer knew

983
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,080
<34-23,BECKETT>法瑞斯会出现在那个小巷里
<34-23,BECKETT>Faris was gonna show up in that alley?

984
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:17,330
<35-1,BECKETT>泰勒·法瑞斯不是她杀的
<35-1,BECKETT>Well, she didn't kill Tyler Faris.

985
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,270
<35-2,CASTLE>你怎么知道
<35-2,CASTLE>How do you know?

986
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,850
<35-3,BECKETT>我  我就是
<35-3,BECKETT>I...I just...

987
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,880
<35-3,BECKETT>我就是知道
<35-3,BECKETT>I know.

988
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,570
<35-4,CASTLE>要是她和查德·霍克尼都不是凶手
<35-4,CASTLE>Well, if she didn't do it and Chad Hockney didn't do it,

989
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,630
<35-4,CASTLE>就是有第三个人扮成孤胆仇侠
<35-4,CASTLE>then we're looking at a third Lone Vengeance,

990
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,040
<35-4,CASTLE>一个聪明的假扮者
<35-4,CASTLE>A clever imposter.

991
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,470
<35-5,BECKETT>好吧  假设我们的凶手
<35-5,BECKETT>Okay, so, uh, let's suppose that our killer

992
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,460
<35-5,BECKETT>确实是假扮者
<35-5,BECKETT>is an imposter.

993
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,520
<35-5,BECKETT>那就说明  他的目标就是泰勒·法瑞斯
<35-5,BECKETT>That would mean that he targeted Tyler Faris

994
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,870
<35-5,BECKETT>穿着特制服装
<35-5,BECKETT>and wore a costume,

995
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,850
<35-5,BECKETT>要么是为了防止别人认出他来
<35-5,BECKETT>either to make sure that nobody could identify him...

996
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,420
<35-6,CASTLE>要么是为确保别人能认出他来
<35-6,CASTLE>Or to make sure he would be identified

997
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,870
<35-6,CASTLE>然后把凶杀罪名嫁祸给孤胆仇侠
<35-6,CASTLE>and frame Lone Vengeance for the murder.

998
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,200
<35-7,BECKETT>而泰勒·法瑞斯则是最适合不过的刀下鬼
<35-7,BECKETT>And Tyler Faris was the perfect victim.

999
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,310
<35-8,CASTLE>是呀  他每天准时出现在漆黑的小巷里
<35-8,CASTLE>Yeah, he shows up in a dark alley like clockwork,

1000
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,780
<35-8,CASTLE>还自带目击证人
<35-8,CASTLE>even brings his own witness.

1001
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,510
<35-9,BECKETT>这样一来  我们要找的凶手可能是个
<35-9,BECKETT>Okay, so then maybe our killer was a criminal

1002
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,840
<35-9,BECKETT>想除掉孤胆仇侠的罪犯
<35-9,BECKETT>who wanted Lone Vengeance off the streets...

1003
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,980
<35-10,CASTLE>一个想报复孤胆仇侠
<35-10,CASTLE>A criminal who wanted Vengeance

1004
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,330
<35-10,CASTLE>和泰勒·法瑞斯的罪犯
<35-10,CASTLE>against Lone Vengeance and Tyler Faris...

1005
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,260
<35-11,BECKETT>一个了解泰勒  并且熟知他的习惯的人
<35-11,BECKETT>Someone who knew Tyler and his habits...

1006
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,130
<35-12,CASTLE>一个有挥刀经验的人
<35-12,CASTLE>Someone who had experience wielding a blade...

1007
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,620
<35-13,BECKETT>一个一开始把我们引向
<35-13,BECKETT>Someone who pointed us to Lone Vengeance

1008
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,660
<35-13,BECKETT>孤胆仇侠的人
<35-13,BECKETT>in the first place.

1009
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,890
<36-1,TONY>你们认为我杀了泰勒·法瑞斯
<36-1,TONY>You think I killed Tyler Faris?

1010
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,250
<36-1,TONY>拜托  你在说梦话吧
<36-1,TONY>Come on. You're dreaming.

1011
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,670
<36-1,TONY>我们知道你想除掉孤胆仇侠
<36-1,TONY>We know you wanted Lone Vengeance off the streets.

1012
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,090
<36-2,BECKETT>他害你损失了不少钱
<36-2,BECKETT>He was costing you money.

1013
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,650
<36-2,BECKETT>我们看过漫画
<36-2,BECKETT>We read the comics.

1014
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,710
<36-2,BECKETT>孤胆仇侠害你损失毒贩
<36-2,BECKETT>Lone Vengeance was shaking down your dealers,

1015
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,260
<36-2,BECKETT>放火烧你的卡车
<36-2,BECKETT>burning your trucks.

1016
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,530
<36-2,BECKETT>所以当法瑞斯以为
<36-2,BECKETT>So when Faris thought

1017
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,960
<36-2,BECKETT>自己悟出孤胆仇侠的真实身份时
<36-2,BECKETT>that he figured out Lone Vengeance's true identity,

1018
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,900
<36-2,BECKETT>他知道你会下大手笔向他买这一信息
<36-2,BECKETT>he knew you'd pay top dollar for it.

1019
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,590
<36-3,TONY>好吧  就算这是真的  当然事实并非如此
<36-3,TONY>All right, even if this were true, which it's not,

1020
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,730
<36-3,TONY>我也没有杀泰勒的动机呀
<36-3,TONY>I got no motive for murder.

1021
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,030
<36-4,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠这样骚扰你的手下
<36-4,CASTLE>You had to be asking yourself all these times

1022
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,340
<36-4,CASTLE>你肯定无数次地问自己
<36-4,CASTLE>Lone Vengeance was harassing your people,

1023
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,120
<36-4,CASTLE>他怎么得到情报的呢
<36-4,CASTLE>how did he know where to go?

1024
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,910
<36-4,CASTLE>是谁在给他通风报信呢
<36-4,CASTLE>Who was tipping him off?

1025
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,830
<36-5,BECKETT>肯定是你手下出了内鬼
<36-5,BECKETT>I mean, it had to have been someone from the inside,

1026
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,590
<36-5,BECKETT>出了个居心叵测的人
<36-5,BECKETT>someone with an ax to grind...

1027
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,750
<36-5,BECKETT>就比如说泰勒·法瑞斯
<36-5,BECKETT>someone just like Tyler Faris.

1028
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,370
<36-6,CASTLE>所以你琢磨
<36-6,CASTLE>So you figured,

1029
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,170
<36-6,CASTLE>何不来个一石二鸟呢
<36-6,CASTLE>why not kill two birds with one stone?

1030
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,690
<36-6,CASTLE>除掉法瑞斯  然后再嫁祸给孤胆仇侠
<36-6,CASTLE>Get rid of Faris and hang the murder on Lone Vengeance.

1031
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,920
<36-7,TONY>这就完了吗
<36-7,TONY>And that's it?

1032
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,870
<36-7,TONY>你们就这点本事吗
<36-7,TONY>I mean, that's all you got?

1033
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,210
<36-8,TONY>你们还敢自称是警察
<36-8,TONY>You guys call yourselves cops?

1034
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,620
<36-8,TONY>真是丢人
<36-8,TONY>You oughta be embarrassed.

1035
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,640
<36-8,TONY>问题是
<36-8,TONY>Here's the problem --

1036
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,470
<36-8,TONY>你们没有证据
<36-8,TONY>you got no proof.

1037
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,760
<36-9,BECKETT>我们还真有证据
<36-9,BECKETT>Actually, we do.

1038
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,800
<36-9,BECKETT>这是从你的衣服上掉下来的
<36-9,BECKETT>That's from your outfit.

1039
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,790
<36-9,BECKETT>我们在上面找到了你表兄厄奈斯托的部分指纹
<36-9,BECKETT>We matched the partial print to your cousin Ernesto.

1040
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,060
<36-10,CASTLE>他是个裁缝
<36-10,CASTLE>The tailor.

1041
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,560
<36-10,CASTLE>我听说他做定制衬衫的手艺不错
<36-10,CASTLE>I've heard great things about his custom-made shirts.

1042
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,460
<36-10,CASTLE>同时他还供认曾为你做了一套
<36-10,CASTLE>But he also confessed to making a Lone Vengeance outfit

1043
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,840
<36-10,CASTLE>孤胆仇侠的衣服
<36-10,CASTLE>for you.

1044
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,080
<36-11,TONY>我要求请律师
<36-11,TONY>I want a lawyer.

1045
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,860
<36-12,BECKETT>你的确需要个律师
<36-12,BECKETT>And you will need one.

1046
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,550
<37-1,BECKETT>那些是你的随身物品
<37-1,BECKETT>Those are your personal effects.

1047
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,990
<37-1,BECKETT>你最好检查一下  看看有没有少东西
<37-1,BECKETT>You probably want to make sure everything is there.

1048
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,760
<37-2,HASTINGS>谢谢  贝克特探长
<37-2,HASTINGS>Thanks, Detective Beckett.

1049
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,280
<37-3,BECKETT>安  你是个好警察
<37-3,BECKETT>Ann, you're a good cop.

1050
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,890
<37-3,BECKETT>你身边也有关心你的人
<37-3,BECKETT>And you've got somebody who cares about you.

1051
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,410
<37-4,BECKETT>别让你的过去左右你
<37-4,BECKETT>Don't be so driven by the past

1052
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,410
<37-4,BECKETT>并因此丢了自己的未来
<37-4,BECKETT>that you throw away your future.

1053
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,530
<37-4,BECKETT>多保重
<37-4,BECKETT>Take care.

1054
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,430
<37-5,CASTLE>破了一起凶杀案
<37-5,CASTLE>Well, a murder solved

1055
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,830
<37-5,CASTLE>还把一个臭名昭著的暴徒逮捕入狱了
<37-5,CASTLE>and a notorious hoodlum off the streets for good --

1056
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,910
<37-5,CASTLE>我认为我们干的相当精彩啊
<37-5,CASTLE>I call that a solid win.

1057
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,430
<37-6,GATES>我同意
<37-6,GATES>I agree.

1058
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,840
<37-6,GATES>这全有赖于这支队伍的努力和敬业
<37-6,GATES>All because of the hard work and dedication of this team.

1059
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,890
<37-7,CASTLE>谢谢你能这么说  警监
<37-7,CASTLE>Thank you, captain. That means a lot.

1060
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,410
<37-8,GATES>我指的是警员
<37-8,GATES>Of police officers.

1061
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,570
<37-8,GATES>这支警员队伍  卡塞尔先生
<37-8,GATES>Team of police officers, Mr. Castle.

1062
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,670
<37-8,GATES>探长
<37-8,GATES>Detective.

1063
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,730
<37-9,GATES>关于黑斯廷警官
<37-9,GATES>About Officer Hastings...

1064
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,640
<37-9,GATES>你在小巷里命令她站住  她还是逃走了
<37-9,GATES>she, uh, fled the alley when you ordered her to stop.

1065
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,930
<37-9,GATES>你能解释一下  你为什么不起诉她吗
<37-9,GATES>Some reason you're not pressing any charges?

1066
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,250
<37-10,BECKETT>我
<37-10,BECKETT>I, uh...

1067
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,850
<37-11,GATES>考虑到有这么多人穿那套服装到处跑
<37-11,GATES>Think that given the number of folks wearing that costume,

1068
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,590
<37-11,GATES>我们也不能证明当时出现在小巷里的人就是她
<37-11,GATES>we can't prove that it was her in the alley,

1069
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,250
<37-11,GATES>也无法证实出现在其他地方的也是她
<37-11,GATES>or anywhere else for that matter.

1070
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,460
<37-12,BECKETT>没错  长官
<37-12,BECKETT>Exactly, sir.

1071
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,250
<37-13,GATES>她是个有大好前途的警官
<37-13,GATES>She's a promising officer.

1072
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,980
<37-13,GATES>也就是说  要是孤胆仇侠再次出现的话
<37-13,GATES>That said, it'd be bad for all of us

1073
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,970
<37-13,GATES>咱们都得吃不了兜着走
<37-13,GATES>if Lone Vengeance were to show up ever again.

1074
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,470
<37-14,BECKETT>我认为这种事不会再发生了  长官
<37-14,BECKETT>I don't think that that will be a problem, sir.

1075
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,580
<37-15,GATES>你最好确保这一点
<37-15,GATES>Well, let's make sure it isn't.

1076
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,490
<37-16,CASTLE>她这是大发善心吗
<37-16,CASTLE>Either she just grew a heart...

1077
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,500
<37-17,BECKETT>我看是她担心万一媒体发现孤胆仇侠
<37-17,BECKETT>Or she's worried about how it would look

1078
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,480
<37-17,BECKETT>是警务人员
<37-17,BECKETT>if the press found out

1079
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,280
<37-17,BECKETT>我们不好收场
<37-17,BECKETT>that Lone Vengeance was one of our own.

1080
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,170
<37-18,CASTLE>一位作家和他的缪斯
<37-18,CASTLE>A writer and his muse...

1081
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,450
<37-18,CASTLE>携手对抗犯罪
<37-18,CASTLE>fighting crime,

1082
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,070
<37-18,CASTLE>就跟咱俩似的
<37-18,CASTLE>just like us.

<38-3,CASTLE>不会吧
<38-3,CASTLE>Really?

1088
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,140
<38-4,MARTHA>这是李尔王[莎士比亚著名悲剧作品的人物]
<38-4,MARTHA>It's King Lear.

1089
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,710
<38-4,MARTHA>我还得改改
<38-4,MARTHA>I have work to do.

1090
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,640
<38-5,CASTLE>干吗呢
<38-5,CASTLE>Hey, What's up?

1091
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,950
<38-6,ALEXIS>我在跟阿什利视频呢
<38-6,ALEXIS>Uh, skyping with Ashley.

1092
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,750
<38-6,ALEXIS>不过现在聊完了
<38-6,ALEXIS>But we just finished.

1093
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,280
<38-6,ALEXIS>你知道吗
<38-6,ALEXIS>You know...

1094
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,140
<38-7,CASTLE>你从小时候起
<38-7,CASTLE>even when you were a little girl,

1095
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,670
<38-7,CASTLE>就是个严肃的人
<38-7,CASTLE>you were a serious person.

1096
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,580
<38-7,CASTLE>我想我只是习惯了
<38-7,CASTLE>I think I've just...

1097
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,000
<38-7,CASTLE>你一直都是
<38-7,CASTLE>gotten used to you being...

1098
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,960
<38-7,CASTLE>很理智很成熟
<38-7,CASTLE>sensible and mature,

1099
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,510
<38-7,CASTLE>甚至有时比我还要更理智和成熟
<38-7,CASTLE>even more than me sometimes.

1100
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,760
<38-8,ALEXIS>"有时"
<38-8,ALEXIS>Sometimes?

1101
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,970
<38-9,CASTLE>同意
<38-9,CASTLE>Point taken.

1102
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,090
<38-9,CASTLE>问题是  阿丽克西斯
<38-9,CASTLE>The thing is, Alexis,

1103
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,760
<38-9,CASTLE>我知道你还有不同的一面
<38-9,CASTLE>I know there are other sides to you --

1104
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,190
<38-9,CASTLE>比如说  冲动的一面
<38-9,CASTLE>impulsive sides,

1105
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,680
<38-9,CASTLE>浪漫的一面
<38-9,CASTLE>romantic sides...

1106
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,270
<38-9,CASTLE>我不希望你刻意遏制你的多面性
<38-9,CASTLE>and I don't want you to deny them.

1107
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,490
<38-9,CASTLE>你说得没错
<38-9,CASTLE>You were right.

1108
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,390
<38-10,ALEXIS>能力越大  责任越大
<38-10,ALEXIS>With great power does come great responsibility.

1109
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,090
<38-10,ALEXIS>我一直很擅长做好自己应做的事
<38-10,ALEXIS>I've always been good at doing what I'm supposed to.

1110
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,110
<38-10,ALEXIS>但是  但是上大学就是要做自己想做的事
<38-10,ALEXIS>But -- but college is about doing what you want,

1111
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,950
<38-10,ALEXIS>追寻自己的梦想
<38-10,ALEXIS>you know, following your passion.

1112
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,660
<38-10,ALEXIS>我决定自己选课
<38-10,ALEXIS>I'm picking my own classes.

1113
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,560
<38-10,ALEXIS>我现在还没拿定主意呢
<38-10,ALEXIS>I don't know which ones yet,

1114
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,910
<38-10,ALEXIS>但肯定不会是经济学
<38-10,ALEXIS>but, um, no economics.

1115
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,130
<38-11,CASTLE>你知道吗
<38-11,CASTLE>And you know what?

1116
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,950
<38-11,CASTLE>即时你不能跟阿什利一块上课
<38-11,CASTLE>Even if you're not in classes with Ashley,

1117
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,350
<38-11,CASTLE>你们也还是会有很多时间见面的
<38-11,CASTLE>you still will see each other plenty.

1118
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,600
<38-12,ALEXIS>我知道  如果我们住在一块就更能多见了
<38-12,ALEXIS>I know, especially if we move in together.
