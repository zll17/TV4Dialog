20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,530
<1-13,CASTLE>-所以严格说来我们不是同事  -是吗
<1-13,CASTLE>- technically, we're not coworkers. - Oh, really?

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,680
<1-14,BECKETT>你觉得盖茨也会这样想吗
<1-14,BECKETT>And you think that captain Gates is gonna see it that way?

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,950
<1-14,BECKETT>如果有人发现了  并让她听到了风声
<1-14,BECKETT>If anyone finds out, and she gets wind of it--

23
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,560
<1-15,CASTLE>没人会发现的
<1-15,CASTLE>No one is going to find out.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,090
<1-15,CASTLE>我连我妈和阿丽克西斯都没告诉
<1-15,CASTLE>I haven't even told my mother or Alexis.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,990
<1-16,BECKETT>那是因为她们在欧洲
<1-16,BECKETT>Yeah, that's because they're in Europe

<1-17,CASTLE>没错  但我也没打长途电话告诉她们
<1-17,CASTLE>Yes, true. But I haven't told them long distance.

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,390
<1-17,CASTLE>听我说  没人会发现的
<1-17,CASTLE>Look, no one is going to find out.

32
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,810
<1-19,CASTLE>看来你是没时间换裤子了
<1-19,CASTLE>And looks like the pants stay on.

33
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,320
<1-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  记住  要装作没事
<1-20,BECKETT>Castle, remember, act normal.

<4-2,JONATHAN>叫我乔尼
<4-2,JONATHAN>It's Johnny.

117
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,260
<4-3,ESPOSITO>档案上写着  乔纳森  你有
<4-3,ESPOSITO>It says here, Jonathan, that you

118
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,250
<4-3,ESPOSITO>跟踪的前科
<4-3,ESPOSITO>have priors for stalking,

119
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,110
<4-3,ESPOSITO>猥亵露阴
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Indecent exposure.

120
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,550
<4-4,JONATHAN>跟踪的事儿是个误会  还有
<4-4,JONATHAN>That stalking was a misunderanding, and...

121
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,550
<4-4,JONATHAN>另一件事儿发生那天实在太热了
<4-4,JONATHAN>That other thing happened on a really hot day.

122
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,820
<4-5,ESPOSITO>反正你什么事都有借口
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Well, you just have an explanation for everything,

123
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,160
<4-5,ESPOSITO>是吧  乔纳森
<4-5,ESPOSITO>don't you, Jonathan?

124
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,470
<4-5,ESPOSITO>那你就给我解释下
<4-5,ESPOSITO>So why don't you explain to me

125
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,760
<4-5,ESPOSITO>你怎么会有曼迪·麦克斯的皮包
<4-5,ESPOSITO>what you were doing with Mandy Michaels' purse.

126
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,700
<4-6,JONATHAN>我捡到的
<4-6,JONATHAN>I found it.

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,140
<4-7,ESPOSITO>你捡到的
<4-7,ESPOSITO>You found it?

128
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,020
<4-8,JONATHAN>在莱克星敦街和第九大道交界的垃圾箱里
<4-8,JONATHAN>In a dumpster on Lexington and 9th.

129
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,310
<4-8,JONATHAN>包很软
<4-8,JONATHAN>It was soft.

130
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,700
<4-8,JONATHAN>我喜欢软软的东西
<4-8,JONATHAN>I like things that are soft.

131
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,900
<5-1,BECKETT>多保重  麦克斯太太
<5-1,BECKETT>Yeah, take care, Ms. Michaels.

132
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,980
<5-3,CASTLE>你还好吗
<5-3,CASTLE>You okay?

133
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
<5-4,BECKETT>我刚和曼迪的父母通完电话
<5-4,BECKETT>Well, I-I just got off the phone with Mandy's parents.

134
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,890
<5-4,BECKETT>他们说她大部分时间都在工作
<5-4,BECKETT>They said that she spent most of her time at work.

135
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,870
<5-4,BECKETT>没有男朋友
<5-4,BECKETT>There was no boyfriend,

136
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,800
<5-4,BECKETT>他们不知道为什么她会去公园
<5-4,BECKETT>and they have no idea why she was in the park.

137
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,640
<5-5,RYAN>两位  看这个
<5-5,RYAN>Hey, guys. Check this out.

138
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,680
<5-5,RYAN>我检查了曼迪的皮包
<5-5,RYAN>I was going through Mandy's purse,

139
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
<5-5,RYAN>发现这个折叠放在她的包里
<5-5,RYAN>And I found this folded up in her wallet.

140
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
<5-5,RYAN>"如果走漏半点风声  我就杀了你"
<5-5,RYAN>"If any of this gets out, I'll kill you"?

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,610
<5-6,CASTLE>我可以大胆判断她被人威胁了
<5-6,CASTLE>I'm gonna go ahead and say she was being threatened.

142
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,220
<5-7,BECKETT>但并不代表这就是她的被害原因
<5-7,BECKETT>That doesn't mean this is why she was killed.

143
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,610
<5-7,BECKETT>所有证据都表明  她是被劫杀的
<5-7,BECKETT>All the evidence points to the fact that she was mugged.

144
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,890
<6-1,LANIE>那不是劫杀
<6-1,LANIE>It wasn't a mugging.

145
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,110
<6-2,BECKETT>你怎么知道的
<6-2,BECKETT>How can you tell?

146
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,300
<6-3,LANIE>她衬衫上的血迹表明
<6-3,LANIE>Blood spatter on her blouse indicates

147
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,420
<6-3,LANIE>衬衫是在枪击之后才撕开的
<6-3,LANIE>the shirt was ripped after the gunshot.

148
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,630
<6-4,CASTLE>那她身上的淤青呢
<6-4,CASTLE>What about the bruising?

149
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,750
<6-4,CASTLE>死后才造成的
<6-4,CASTLE>Postmortem.

150
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,190
<6-6,BECKETT>为了伪装得像劫杀
<6-6,BECKETT>To make it look like a mugging.

151
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,920
<6-7,LANIE>有人试图掩盖踪迹
<6-7,LANIE>Someone's trying to cover their tracks.

152
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,030
<6-7,LANIE>说到这个
<6-7,LANIE>Speaking of which,

153
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,750
<6-7,LANIE>我终于想明白你有什么不同了
<6-7,LANIE>I figured out what's different.

154
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,250
<6-7,LANIE>你做爱了
<6-7,LANIE>You're having sex.

155
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,670
<6-8,BECKETT>你说什么
<6-8,BECKETT>Excuse me?

156
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,040
<6-9,LANIE>别想抵赖
<6-9,LANIE>Oh, don't try to deny it.

157
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,370
<6-9,LANIE>你脸上红光焕发  我很清楚那种红光
<6-9,LANIE>There's a glow. I know that glow.

158
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,590
<6-10,LANIE>快说那个男人是谁
<6-10,LANIE>So who's the guy?

159
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,800
<6-11,CASTLE>是啊  贝克特  那男人是谁啊
<6-11,CASTLE>Yeah, Beckett, who's the guy?

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,180
<6-12,BECKETT>反正不是你认识的人  行了吧
<6-12,BECKETT>Nobody that you would know, okay?

161
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,630
<6-13,CASTLE>你确定吗  我可是认识很多人的
<6-13,CASTLE>Are you sure? I know a lot of guys.

162
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,930
<6-14,BECKETT>我很确定  还有别的信息吗
<6-14,BECKETT>I'm sure. Anything else?

163
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,210
<6-14,BECKETT>实际上
<6-14,BECKETT>As a matter of fact,

164
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,340
<6-15,LANIE>我在曼迪的衬衫上发现的化妆品
<6-15,LANIE>I found makeup on Mandy's blouse

165
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,770
<6-15,LANIE>比她身上用的清淡得多
<6-15,LANIE>that's much lighter than the shade that she wears.

166
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,960
<6-15,LANIE>沾在此处表明二人曾近距离接触
<6-15,LANIE>The position indicates close contact,

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,670
<6-15,LANIE>就像她曾和某人打过架
<6-15,LANIE>like she fought with someone.

168
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,400
<6-16,CASTLE>彻查全城使用清淡化妆品的女性
<6-16,CASTLE>Rounding up all the women in the city who wear lighter makeup

169
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,860
<6-16,CASTLE>可是个大工程啊
<6-16,CASTLE>is a pretty wide net.

170
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,170
<6-17,LANIE>那可不是普通的化妆品
<6-17,LANIE>It isn't just any makeup.

171
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,460
<6-17,LANIE>是为高清摄像头专门设计的
<6-17,LANIE>It's formulated for high-definition cameras.

172
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,020
<6-18,BECKETT>比如电视台常用的那种
<6-18,BECKETT>Like the ones they use at TV stations.

173
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,270
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>与此同时  执法部门正全力追查
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>In the meantime, authorities are still on the hunt

174
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,830
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>曼迪·麦克斯被害案的嫌疑人
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>for suspects in the Mandy Michaels slaying.

175
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,340
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>尽管警方并未透露过多细节
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>Though few details have been released,

176
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,260
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>但我们可以确定  她是昨夜被枪杀的
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>we can confirm that she was shot to death late last night

177
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,900
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>地点是佩里公园
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>in Paley park.

178
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,670
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>我想代表电视台的全体工作人员说一句
<7-1,MILES HAXTON>Speaking on behalf of the entire broadcast community,

179
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,920

188
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,060

<7-4,HARVEY>We're like a family.

189

<7-5,CASTLE>什么样的家庭  幸福的还是不和的
<7-5,CASTLE>What kind of family, happy or dysfunctional?

190
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,450
<7-6,HARVEY>你什么意思
<7-6,HARVEY>What do you mean?

191
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,510
<7-7,BECKETT>意思就是  作为电视台台长
<7-7,BECKETT>Meaning, as the station manager,

192
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,980
<7-7,BECKETT>你应该很清楚自己手下的人事情况
<7-7,BECKETT>you would know your personnel.

193
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,770
<7-7,BECKETT>她和谁有过节吗
<7-7,BECKETT>Did she have any conflicts with anyone?

194
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,120
<7-8,HARVEY>当然  但我不觉得
<7-8,HARVEY>Sure, but I-I can't imagine

195
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,750
<7-8,HARVEY>那和她的被害有关
<7-8,HARVEY>that has anything to do with what happened.

196
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,840
<7-9,BECKETT>谁和她有过节
<7-9,BECKETT>Well, who was it?

197
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,680
<7-10,HARVEY>另一个女性天气预报员  瑞贝卡·弗格
<7-10,HARVEY>The other weather girl, Rebecca Fog.

198
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,490
<7-11,CASTLE>弗格[雾]真是她的姓吗
<7-11,CASTLE>Is Fog her real name?

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,250
<7-12,BECKETT>她们是为什么起冲突的
<7-12,BECKETT>And what was the conflict?

200
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,170
<7-13,HARVEY>瑞贝卡是新来的气象学家
<7-13,HARVEY>Rebecca was the new meteorologist.

201
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,690
<7-13,HARVEY>她野心勃勃  对曼迪步步紧逼
<7-13,HARVEY>She was ambitious and nipping at Mandy's heels.

202
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,450
<7-14,BECKETT>最近有发生什么事吗
<7-14,BECKETT>Had anything happened recently?

203
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,950
<7-15,HARVEY>实际上  她们确实才闹过一场架
<7-15,HARVEY>As a matter of fact, they did just get into a bit of a scuffle.

204
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,610
<7-16,BECKETT>是吗  什么时候的事

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,120
<8-17,HARVEY>摄像师关掉了摄像机去劝架了
<8-17,HARVEY>The cameraman turned off his camera and broke up the fight.

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,390
<8-18,BECKETT>他看见瑞贝卡离开了吗
<8-18,BECKETT>Did he see Rebecca leave?

233
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,880
<8-19,HARVEY>没有  她们冷静下来之后
<8-19,HARVEY>No. Once they settled down,

234
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,580
<8-19,HARVEY>他就走了  剩她们二人继续谈
<8-19,HARVEY>he left them there talking.

235
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,260
<8-20,CASTLE>那肯定是一场奇"谈"啊
<8-20,CASTLE>Well, it must have been a hell of a talk.

236
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,830
<8-20,CASTLE>一小时后  曼迪就死了
<8-20,CASTLE>An hour later, Mandy was dead.

246
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,720
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>听着  曼迪·麦克斯是个懒惰
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>Look, mandy michaels was a lazy,

247
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,350
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>资深  胸大的蠢女人
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>entitled, big-boobed bimbo.

248
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,640
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>我一来就开始做那些她挑剩的活儿
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>I've been picking up her slack since the minute I got here.

249
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,170
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>"哈维  我不能坐直升机报道交通实况"
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>"Harvey, "I can't go in the helicopter for 'traffic live!'

250
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,210
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>"因为我有哮喘
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>"Because of my asthma.

251
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,360
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>让瑞贝卡去干吧"
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>Make Rebecca do it."

252
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,240
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>我讨厌她吗  当然
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>I mean, did I hate her? Yes.

253
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,470
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>但我不会杀她的
<9-1,REBECCA FOG>But I would never kill her.

254
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,780
<9-2,BECKETT>不过现在她死了
<9-2,BECKETT>Except now that she's dead,

255
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,760
<9-2,BECKETT>你可以从凌晨4点的时间档
<9-2,BECKETT>you get to trade in 4:00 A.M. shift

256
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,810
<9-2,BECKETT>调到极具诱惑的晚间新闻档  是吧
<9-2,BECKETT>for the coveted and lucrative evening news spot, right?

257
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,880
<9-3,REBECCA>拜托
<9-3,REBECCA>Oh, please.

258
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,610
<9-3,REBECCA>我不需要为那个杀了她
<9-3,REBECCA>I didn't need to kill her for that.

259
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,760
<9-3,REBECCA>我只要再等等就行了
<9-3,REBECCA>I just needed to wait.

260
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,370
<9-3,REBECCA>她的巅峰时期已经过了
<9-3,REBECCA>She was already past her sell-by date.

261
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,620
<9-4,CASTLE>根据哈维的说法
<9-4,CASTLE>Well, according to Harvey,

262
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,440
<9-4,CASTLE>她依然有很多忠实的观众
<9-4,CASTLE>she still had a very loyal audience.

263
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,770
<9-5,REBECCA>是啊  但那些人
<9-5,REBECCA>Sure. Yeah, people who cared

264
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,040
<9-5,REBECCA>只关心她的衬衫开了几颗纽扣
<9-5,REBECCA>about how many buttons on her blouse were open.

265
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,470
<9-5,REBECCA>但她那个年纪  在高清电视环境下
<9-5,REBECCA>But at her age in high def,

266
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,710
<9-5,REBECCA>她很快就会被观众抛弃的
<9-5,REBECCA>she was running out of buttons fast.

267
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,760
<9-6,BECKETT>你俩打架又是怎么回事  弗格小姐
<9-6,BECKETT>Then what was the fight about, Ms. Fog?

268
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,730
<9-7,REBECCA>我是个有证书的气象学家  好吗
<9-7,REBECCA>Look, I'm a certified meteorologist. Okay?

269
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,600
<9-7,REBECCA>我是靠大脑的
<9-7,REBECCA>I have a brain.

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,520
<9-7,REBECCA>曼迪不过是靠风骚姿色混到了现在
<9-7,REBECCA>Mandy was just set dressing with cleavage.

271
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,540
<9-7,REBECCA>我的预报比她的要准确的多
<9-7,REBECCA>My forecasts were way more accurate than hers,

272
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,020
<9-7,REBECCA>而且人们也开始注意到了
<9-7,REBECCA>And people were starting to notice.

273
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,730
<9-7,REBECCA>所以上周  她为了报复我  闯入我的办公室
<9-7,REBECCA>So last week, to get back at me, she breaks into my office,

274
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,280
<9-7,REBECCA>偷走了我的一堆设备
<9-7,REBECCA>she steals a bunch of my equipment.

275
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,280
<9-7,REBECCA>所以我才去找她对质
<9-7,REBECCA>I mean, that's why I went to confront her.

276
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,980
<9-7,REBECCA>但就那样  仅此而已
<9-7,REBECCA>But that's it. That's all.

277
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,860
<9-8,BECKETT>昨晚10:28你在哪里
<9-8,BECKETT>Where were you at 10:28 last night?

278
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,070
<9-9,REBECCA>在家睡觉
<9-9,REBECCA>Home sleeping.

279
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,180
<9-9,REBECCA>我凌晨四点要上班的  记得吗
<9-9,REBECCA>I mean, I have the 4:00 A.M. shift, remember?

280
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,060
<9-9,REBECCA>而且  她比我早离开那家儿童医院
<9-9,REBECCA>And besides, she left the children's hospital before I did.

281
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,300
<9-9,REBECCA>你们想查出是谁杀害了曼迪
<9-9,REBECCA>You want to find out who killed Mandy,

282
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,620
<9-9,REBECCA>就去问开着银色奔驰车接她的人吧
<9-9,REBECCA>ask the person in the silver g-wagon who picked her up.

283
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,360
<9-10,CASTLE>什么人
<9-10,CASTLE>What person?

284
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,350
<9-10,CASTLE>我不知道  你问倒我了
<9-10,CASTLE>I don't know. Beats me.

285
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,380
<9-11,REBECCA>那车的车窗贴着防透视玻璃
<9-11,REBECCA>The car had tinted windows,

286
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,220
<9-11,REBECCA>但她肯定认识他们
<9-11,REBECCA>But it sure seemed like she knew them.

287
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,620
<10-1,ESPOSITO>瑞贝卡的不在场证明是真的
<10-1,ESPOSITO>So Rebecca was telling the truth about where she was.

288
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,460
<10-1,ESPOSITO>她用信用卡付的出租车钱
<10-1,ESPOSITO>She paid for the cab with a credit card,

289
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,980
<10-1,ESPOSITO>在曼迪被害之前
<10-1,ESPOSITO>and the cabbie dropped her off at her apartment

290
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,540
<10-1,ESPOSITO>司机就把她送回了家
<10-1,ESPOSITO>before Mandy was killed.

291
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,450
<10-1,ESPOSITO>好吧  那查查交通摄像头
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Okay. Yeah, so check traffic cams

292
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,160
<10-1,ESPOSITO>和监控录像  看有没有银色的奔驰
<10-1,ESPOSITO>and surveillance in the area for the silver G-Wagon.

293
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,040
<11-1,BECKETT>运气好的话  我们...
<11-1,BECKETT>Yeah, I mean, if we're lucky, we'll...

294
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,980
<11-2,BECKETT>也许能查到车牌
<11-2,BECKETT>we might actually get a plate.

295
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,870
<11-3,BECKETT>你能追查通话记录
<11-3,BECKETT>So, uh, were you able to track down the phone records

296
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,630
<11-3,BECKETT>看看她那晚是否打过电话吗
<11-3,BECKETT>to see if she made any calls that night?

297
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,110
<11-4,BECKETT>好的
<11-4,BECKETT>Okay.

298
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,310
<11-5,KRISTINA COTERRA>理查德  理查德·卡塞尔
<11-5,KRISTINA COTERRA>Richard. Richard castle.

299
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,050
<11-7,CASTLE>克里斯蒂娜  好久不见...
<11-7,CASTLE>Kristina. Oh, I have not seen you...

300
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,040
<11-7,CASTLE>自从...
<11-7,CASTLE>Since...

301
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,600
<11-8,KRISTINA>自从我在红毯上采访了你
<11-8,KRISTINA>Since I interviewed you on the red carpet

302
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,250
<11-8,KRISTINA>你还答应要来我的节目呢
<11-8,KRISTINA>and you promised to do my show.

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,760
<11-11,KRISTINA>弗雷德·威拉德今晚放我鸽子了
<11-11,KRISTINA>Fred Willard canceled on me tonight.

305
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,530
<11-11,KRISTINA>我没有嘉宾了  真是命中注定啊
<11-11,KRISTINA>I don't have a guest. I feel like it's fate.

306
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,300
<11-12,BECKETT>我得挂电话了  埃斯波  再见
<11-12,BECKETT>Okay. I gotta go, Espo. Bye.

<11-14,KRISTINA>I'm not taking no for an answer.

309
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,340
<11-15,CASTLE>那我就不推拒了
<11-15,CASTLE>Well, then I won't say no.

<11-17,KRISTINA>Good. I'll see you soon, Ricky.

311
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,230
<11-18,CASTLE>好的
<11-18,CASTLE>All right.

312
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,010
<11-19,CASTLE>那只是他们电视台的娱记
<11-19,CASTLE>Oh, that's just their entertainment reporter.

313
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,790
<11-19,CASTLE>她...我经纪人一直催着我
<11-19,CASTLE>She's... My agent has been haranguing me

314
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,320
<11-19,CASTLE>去宣传《冰冻希特》...
<11-19,CASTLE>to promote "Frozen Heat", so...

315
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,630
<11-19,CASTLE>她不就是那个
<11-19,CASTLE>Isn't she the reporter

316
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,360
<11-20,BECKETT>穿着比基尼上节目的记者吗
<11-20,BECKETT>that shows up to cover stories in her bikini?

317
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,080
<11-21,CASTLE>是吧  我  我没留意
<11-21,CASTLE>Yeah, y--I don't--is-- I didn't notice that.

318
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,460
<11-22,BECKETT>要不要再说一次
<11-22,BECKETT>You want to try it again,

319
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,690
<11-22,BECKETT>看看能不能装得更像一点
<11-22,BECKETT>make it sound a little more convincing?

320
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,550
<11-23,CASTLE>不用了
<11-23,CASTLE>No, I'm good.

321
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,040
<11-24,BECKETT>他们俩正在搜寻那辆神秘车
<11-24,BECKETT>Okay. So the boys are running down our mystery car.

322
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,870
<11-25,BECKETT>同时  他们在曼迪的通话记录中也有发现
<11-25,BECKETT>In the meantime, they found something on Mandy's phone records.

323
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,130
<11-25,BECKETT>她一直接到一个匿名手机号的电话
<11-25,BECKETT>She was getting calls from an anonymous burner cell.

324
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,600
<11-25,BECKETT>事实上  她死前接到的最后一通电话
<11-25,BECKETT>In fact, the last call she got before her murder

325
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,590
<11-26,CASTLE>-就来自这个号码  -但我们无法追踪
<11-26,CASTLE>- was from that number. - But there's no way to trace it.

326
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,230
<11-27,BECKETT>也许有办法  这些通话记录有个模式
<11-27,BECKETT>Yeah, there might be. There's a pattern on the calls,

327
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,370
<11-27,BECKETT>大多数都在工作日凌晨两点到四点拨入
<11-27,BECKETT>and most of them came in on weekdays between 2:00 and 4:00.

328
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,520
<11-28,CASTLE>就在她的天气预报之前
<11-28,CASTLE>That's right before her broadcast.

329
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
<11-29,BECKETT>也就是说她在这里
<11-29,BECKETT>Which means she was here.

330
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,500
<11-29,BECKETT>没错  曼迪两点到四点是在这里
<11-29,BECKETT>Yeah, Mandy was here between 2:00 and 4:00.

331
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,560
<11-29,BECKETT>她上镜前需要多画点妆
<11-29,BECKETT>She needed all the time in that chair she could get.

332
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,090
<11-29,BECKETT>女人一旦到了三十五岁
<11-29,BECKETT>When a woman hits mid-30s,

333
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,200
<11-29,BECKETT>那些高清摄像机很快就能出卖你的年龄
<11-29,BECKETT>those H.D. cameras can turn on you fast.

334
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,490
<11-29,BECKETT>比我前夫在床上的速度还快
<11-29,BECKETT>Faster-than-my-ex-husband in-the-sack fast.

335
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,200
<12-1,BECKETT>我们想问问她到这里以后
<12-1,BECKETT>You know, we were wondering about a series of phone calls

336
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,830
<12-1,BECKETT>接到的那些电话
<12-1,BECKETT>that she might have gotten while she was here.

337
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,680
<12-2,CASTLE>她的秘密男友
<12-2,CASTLE>Her secret man.

338
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,680
<12-2,CASTLE>秘密男友
<12-2,CASTLE>Secret man?

339
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,750
<12-2,CASTLE>曼迪从不隐瞒自己的感情生活
<12-2,CASTLE>Mandy was always open about her love life,

340
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,390
<12-2,CASTLE>但只要这家伙打电话来
<12-2,CASTLE>but when this guy would call,

341
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,620
<12-2,CASTLE>她就会离开房间
<12-2,CASTLE>she'd leave the room.

342
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,740
<12-3,BECKETT>她想低调行事
<12-3,BECKETT>She was keeping it on the down low.

343
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,550
<12-3,BECKETT>你总觉得自己很小心谨慎了
<12-3,BECKETT>Yeah, you always think you're being so discreet,

344
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,510
<12-3,BECKETT>不过相信我  群众的眼睛是雪亮的
<12-3,BECKETT>but trust me, people know.

345
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,090
<12-3,BECKETT>那你们知道那个神秘男友是谁吗
<12-3,BECKETT>So do you guys have any idea who he is?

346
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,250
<16-3,REGGIE>知道  几周前我去外面的
<16-3,REGGIE>Yeah. A few weeks ago I went outside

347
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,120
<16-4,RYAN>自动贩卖机买个坚果黄油饼干
<16-4,RYAN>to get a nutter butter from the vending machine,

348
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,390

<15-5,CASTLE>More like an M.V.P.

<15-6,BECKETT>本地一支非常出名的篮球队中的一员
<15-6,BECKETT>Of a very well-known local basketball team.

352
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,680
<15-7,CASTLE>17号有没有让你想起谁
<15-7,CASTLE>Does the number 17 ring a bell?

353
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,730
<12-5,CASTLE>雷吉·布雷克
<12-5,CASTLE>Reggie Blake?

354
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,220
<12-5,CASTLE>她在和雷吉·布雷克交往
<12-5,CASTLE>She was dating Reggie Blake?

355

359
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,720
<13-1,ESPOSITO>根据他的收入  离婚可是要花大价钱的
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Based on his income, it'd be very costly if he got a divorce.

360
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,820
<13-2,RYAN>再猜猜他开什么车的
<13-2,RYAN>And guess what he drives.

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,520
<14-8,ESPOSITO>我们是纽约警察
<14-8,ESPOSITO>We're NYPD.

384
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,480

<14-9,BODYGUARD>I don't give a hobo's crap if you're CIA.

385
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,500
<14-9,BODYGUARD>不签名了

<14-10,ESPOSITO>我们不是来要签名的  我们来请雷吉走一趟
<14-10,ESPOSITO>We're not here for autographs. We're here for Reggie.

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,090
<14-11,RYAN>而你在妨碍公务
<14-11,RYAN>And you're obstructing our investigation.

388
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,460
<14-12,ESPOSITO>让开
<14-12,ESPOSITO>So move.

389
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:02,980
<14-13,ESPOSITO>就该这样
<14-13,ESPOSITO>That's what I thought.

390
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,710
<14-14,RYAN>见鬼
<14-14,RYAN>Oh, hell.

391
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,360
<14-15,SECURITY GUY>雷吉哪里都不去
<14-15,SECURITY GUY>You're not taking Reggie anywhere.

392
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,840
<14-16,ESPOSITO>让路
<14-16,ESPOSITO>Get out of the way, man.

393
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,180
<15-1,CASTLE>他们怎么还没回来
<15-1,CASTLE>Shouldn't they be back by now?

394
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,440
<15-2,BECKETT>可能路上堵车了
<15-2,BECKETT>Well, maybe they hit traffic.

395
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,390
<15-3,CASTLE>或者赌气吧
<15-3,CASTLE>Or each other.

396
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,650
<15-4,BECKETT>不管怎样  雷吉这下惨了
<15-4,BECKETT>Either way, Reggie is going down.

397
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,530
<15-4,BECKETT>警员彻查了曼迪的住所
<15-4,BECKETT>UNIS canvassed Mandy's building,

398
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,270
<15-4,BECKETT>邻居说在她被害当天
<15-4,BECKETT>and neighbors said that they heard her

399
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,470
<15-4,BECKETT>听到了她和一个男人吵架
<15-4,BECKETT>in a yelling match with a guy the day that she was killed.

400
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,030
<15-4,BECKETT>他们说听起来像是情侣间的口角
<15-4,BECKETT>They said it sounded like a lover's quarrel.

401
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,620
<15-5,CASTLE>感情破裂  婚姻危机
<15-5,CASTLE>Relationship goes bad, his marriage is threatened...

402
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,290
<15-6,BECKETT>所以雷吉威胁她说
<15-6,BECKETT>so Reggie threatens her with the note.

403
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,360
<15-6,BECKETT>"要是走漏半点风声  我就杀了你"
<15-6,BECKETT>"If this gets out, I'll kill you."

404
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,060
<15-7,CASTLE>她不肯乖乖听话  雷吉就干了他最擅长的事
<15-7,CASTLE>She refuses to play ball, so Reggie does what he does best--

405
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,530
<15-7,CASTLE>开枪杀人[也有投篮之意]
<15-7,CASTLE>starts shooting.

406
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,890
<15-8,ESPOSITO>别问
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Don't ask.

407
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,660
<16-1,REGGIE BLAKE>两位  我很抱歉
<16-1,REGGIE BLAKE>Look, man, I'm sorry.

408
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,410
<16-1,REGGIE BLAKE>我的安保人员护主心切
<16-1,REGGIE BLAKE>My security guys are protective.

409
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,690
<16-1,REGGIE BLAKE>那附近有不少疯子
<16-1,REGGIE BLAKE>We get a lot of nut bars hanging around the block.

410
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,470
<16-2,ESPOSITO>不接受道歉
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Apology not accepted.

411
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,590
<16-2,ESPOSITO>坐下
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Now sit down.

412
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,490
<16-3,REGGIE>我说过了
<16-3,REGGIE>Look, I told you,

413
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,750
<16-3,REGGIE>我和她的凶杀案无关
<16-3,REGGIE>I didn't have anything to do with her murder.

414
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,100
<16-4,RYAN>但我们有目击者看到曼迪
<16-4,RYAN>And yet, we have witnesses that saw Mandy

415
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,480
<16-4,RYAN>在被害前不久还上了你的车
<16-4,RYAN>get in to your car shortly before she was killed.

416
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,540
<16-4,RYAN>我们知道你俩在偷情  雷吉
<16-4,RYAN>We know about the affair, Reggie.

417
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,260
<16-4,RYAN>你妻子知道的话一定会勃然大怒吧
<16-4,RYAN>Can't imagine your wife would be too happy if she found out,

418
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,410
<16-4,RYAN>于是你确保了她不会知晓此事
<16-4,RYAN>so you made sure she didn't.

419
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,270
<16-5,REGGIE>你们说什么呢  什么偷情
<16-5,REGGIE>What are you talking about, affair?

420
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,830
<16-5,REGGIE>我是认识曼迪  我妻子也认识她
<16-5,REGGIE>Yeah, I knew Mandy. So did my wife.

421
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,520
<16-5,REGGIE>我们是朋友  仅此而已
<16-5,REGGIE>We were friends. That's all.

422
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,160
<16-6,ESPOSITO>你觉得我们信吗  雷吉
<16-6,ESPOSITO>You really expect us to believe that, Reggie?

423
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,940
<16-7,REGGIE>这是事实  不信的话  尽管问我妻子
<16-7,REGGIE>It's the truth. If you don't believe me, ask my wife.

424
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,750
<16-8,ESPOSITO>我们会去问的
<16-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, we will.

425
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,840
<16-9,RYAN>那你在曼迪播报结束之后
<16-9,RYAN>So I imagine it was just a coincidence

426
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,770
<16-9,RYAN>刚好驾车经过医院
<16-9,RYAN>that you happened to be driving by the hospital

427
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,330
<16-9,RYAN>这一切不过是巧合而已了
<16-9,RYAN>right after Mandy's segment ended.

428
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,100
<16-10,REGGIE>不  我们都是医院慈善会的董事
<16-10,REGGIE>No. We're both on the hospital charity board.

429
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,750
<16-10,REGGIE>我过去捐些玩具
<16-10,REGGIE>I was stopping by the toy drive.

430
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,320
<16-10,REGGIE>我说了  我们只是朋友
<16-10,REGGIE>I'm telling you, we were just friends.

431
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,870
<16-11,ESPOSITO>如果"只是朋友"
<16-11,ESPOSITO>Well, there sure are a lot of phone calls to Mandy,

432
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,580
<16-11,ESPOSITO>那你给曼迪打的电话也太多了吧
<16-11,ESPOSITO>considering you all are just friends.

433
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,950
<16-12,REGGIE>曼迪和我
<16-12,REGGIE>Mandy and I...

434
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,160
<16-12,REGGIE>我们的职业生涯都进入倒计时了
<16-12,REGGIE>We both had a ticking clock on our careers--

435
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,410
<16-12,REGGIE>她的脸蛋  我的膝盖
<16-12,REGGIE>Her looks, my knees.

436
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,540
<16-12,REGGIE>能跟理解自己的人聊天  感觉很好
<16-12,REGGIE>It was nice to chat with somebody who understood.

437
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,200
<16-13,RYAN>那好  就算你们"只是朋友"
<16-13,RYAN>Okay, say you were just friends.

438
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,850
<16-13,RYAN>为什么她不想让她的同事
<16-13,RYAN>Why didn't she want her coworkers

439
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,950
<16-13,RYAN>知道你和他的关系呢
<16-13,RYAN>to find out about you?

440
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,120
<16-14,REGGIE>因为会招来绯闻啊
<16-14,REGGIE>Because that's how rumors get started.

441
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,240
<17-6,CASTLE>我知道你们会怎么想
<17-6,CASTLE>I know what you're thinking.

442
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,560
<17-7,BECKETT>我是名职业运动员
<17-7,BECKETT>I'm a professional athlete,

443
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,040
<17-8,CASTLE>她是个美女气象预报员
<17-8,CASTLE>She's a blonde weather girl,

444
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,180
<17-9,BECKETT>但事情不是你们想的那样
<17-9,BECKETT>But it wasn't like that.

445
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,650
<17-10,CASTLE>她不是那样的人
<17-10,CASTLE>She wasn't like that.

446
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,690
<16-12,REGGIE>那些在福利院的孩子们
<16-12,REGGIE>Those kids at city of trust,

447
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,880
<16-13,RYAN>对于其他名人来说  只是个作秀的幌子
<16-13,RYAN>to other celebs, they was just a photo op.

448
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,680
<16-14,REGGIE>但对她来说不是  她真的关心那些孩子
<16-14,REGGIE>Not to her. She cared.

449
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,160
<16-14,REGGIE>你们该看看她上个星期为孩子们做了什么
<16-14,REGGIE>You should seen her last week,

450
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,440
<16-14,REGGIE>向他们提问题
<16-14,REGGIE>asking them questions,

451
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,290
<16-14,REGGIE>倾听他们的故事
<16-14,REGGIE>listening to their stories.

452
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,770
<16-14,REGGIE>别人都以为她生活不检点
<16-14,REGGIE>People think she's some kind of bimbo,

453
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,460
<16-14,REGGIE>其实她并非那样
<16-14,REGGIE>But she wasn't.

454
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,320
<16-14,REGGIE>总之  我之前看见她拦下一辆出租车
<16-14,REGGIE>Anyway, I-I saw her hailing a cab.

455
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,340
<16-20,REGGIE>我就提出载她一程
<16-20,REGGIE>I offered her a ride.

456
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,120
<16-17,RYAN>她让我送她到公园
<16-17,RYAN>She asked to be dropped off at the park.

457
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,640
<16-14,REGGIE>那时大约是十点
<16-14,REGGIE>That happened around 10:00.

458
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,940
<16-15,RYAN>10:28的时候你在哪
<16-15,RYAN>Where were you at 10:28?

459
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,880
<16-16,REGGIE>我去了城市另一边的X酒吧
<16-16,REGGIE>I was across town at X bar,

460
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,210
<16-16,REGGIE>为我的新款鞋子做促销
<16-16,REGGIE>Promoting my new shoe line.

461
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,250
<16-16,REGGIE>不信你们去查
<16-16,REGGIE>Check it.

462
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,420
<16-17,RYAN>曼迪有没有说她为什么
<16-17,RYAN>Mandy mention why she wanted

463
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,800
<16-17,RYAN>要去公园
<16-17,RYAN>to get dropped off at the park?

464
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,230
<16-18,REGGIE>没说  她看上去有些紧张
<16-18,REGGIE>No. She seemed nervous.

465
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,700
<16-18,REGGIE>或许跟几天前
<16-18,REGGIE>Maybe it had something to do

466
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,010
<16-19,ESPOSITO>发生的那件事有关
<16-19,ESPOSITO>with what happened a couple of days ago.

467
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,350
<16-19,ESPOSITO>几天前发生了什么事
<16-19,ESPOSITO>What happened a couple of days ago?

468
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,060
<16-20,REGGIE>她在急诊室给我打电话让我去接她
<16-20,REGGIE>She called me for a ride from the emergency room.

469
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,460
<16-20,REGGIE>我问她发生什么事了  但她不肯说
<16-20,REGGIE>I asked her what happened, but she wouldn't say.

470
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,100
<16-21,RYAN>等等  她是去就诊的吗
<16-21,RYAN>Wait. She was there as a patient?

471
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,930
<16-21,RYAN>是的
<16-21,RYAN>Yeah.

472
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,670
<16-22,REGGIE>她看起来不像有恙  但看得出她很沮丧
<16-22,REGGIE>She didn't look hurt, but she seemed pretty upset.

473
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,650
<17-1,BECKETT>你相信他们"只是朋友"吗
<17-1,BECKETT>Do you actually buy this whole "Just friends" thing?

474
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,810
<17-2,CASTLE>这很合情
<17-2,CASTLE>It's possible.

475
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,360
<17-3,BECKETT>对  是合情  但不合理
<17-3,BECKETT>Yeah, it's possible, but it's not probable.

476
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,520
<17-4,CASTLE>说不清  咱俩这四年不就在只是朋友吗
<17-4,CASTLE>I don't know. You and I were just friends for four years.

477
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,890
<17-5,BECKETT>是啊  只是你这四年一直都想跟我上床
<17-5,BECKETT>Yeah, except you were trying to sleep with me that whole time.

478
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,140
<17-6,CASTLE>开什么玩笑
<17-6,CASTLE>What?

479
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,320
<17-7,BECKETT>纠正一下
<17-7,BECKETT>Excuse me.

480
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,620
<17-8,CASTLE>是你一直想跟我上床
<17-8,CASTLE>It was you that was trying to sleep with me.

481
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,980
<17-10,CASTLE>别告诉我你穿成那样是给埃斯波西托看的
<17-10,CASTLE>Don't tell me you dress like that for Esposito.

482
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,650
<17-11,ESPOSITO>给我看什么
<17-11,ESPOSITO>What's for me?

483
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,150
<17-12,CASTLE>-没什么  -啥也没有
<17-12,CASTLE>- Nothing. - Don't worry about it.

484
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,950
<17-14,ESPOSITO>雷吉的不在场证据被证实了
<17-14,ESPOSITO>Reggie's alibi is solid.

485
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,600
<17-14,ESPOSITO>曼迪遇害时他已经在X酒吧
<17-14,ESPOSITO>He was already at the X bar buying shots for everyone

486
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,640
<17-14,ESPOSITO>请大家喝酒了
<17-14,ESPOSITO>when Mandy was killed.

487
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,200
<17-14,ESPOSITO>他的妻子也证实了他们只是朋友关系
<17-14,ESPOSITO>His wife confirms that they were all just friends.

488
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,980
<17-14,ESPOSITO>实际上  是他妻子
<17-14,ESPOSITO>In fact, she's the one

489
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,340
<17-14,ESPOSITO>给他买了那部预付款手机
<17-14,ESPOSITO>who bought him that prepaid cell phone

490
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,650
<17-14,ESPOSITO>因为他的手机好像被黑了
<17-14,ESPOSITO>Because his was hacked or something.

491
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,150
<17-15,BECKETT>好吧  那就去联系几天前
<17-15,BECKETT>Okay, then touch base with the E.R. doctor

492
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,700
<17-15,BECKETT>给曼迪看病的那个急诊室医生
<17-15,BECKETT>that treated Mandy a couple of days ago.

493
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,450
<17-15,BECKETT>造成她去医院的原因
<17-15,BECKETT>Whatever landed her in emergency

494
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,990
<17-15,BECKETT>可能会告诉我们昨天晚上发生了什么
<17-15,BECKETT>might have caught up with her last night.

495
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,260
<17-16,RYAN>-伙计们  我发现了  -等等
<17-16,RYAN>- Hey, guys. I found out who Mandy. -Yo.

496
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,890
<17-17,ESPOSITO>你化妆了吗
<17-17,ESPOSITO>Are you wearing makeup?

497
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,850
<17-18,RYAN>没有
<17-18,RYAN>No.

498
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,750
<17-18,RYAN>真的
<17-18,RYAN>Really?

499
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,580
<17-19,ESPOSITO>一个小时前  咱俩都被打成了熊猫眼
<17-19,ESPOSITO>Because an hour ago, you and I both had black eyes,

500
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,400
<17-19,ESPOSITO>可你这么快就没事了
<17-19,ESPOSITO>and now you don't.

501
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,100
<17-20,RYAN>不是的  这不是化妆
<17-20,RYAN>No, this is not makeup.

502
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,760
<17-20,RYAN>只是用了些有色面霜
<17-20,RYAN>This is tinted moisturizer.

503
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,530
<17-22,RYAN>刚才珍妮来了
<17-22,RYAN>Jenny just stopped by,

504
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,950
<17-22,RYAN>她包里恰好有些这种面霜
<17-22,RYAN>She happened to have some in her purse,

505
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,930
<17-22,RYAN>我想既然  你懂的
<17-22,RYAN>and I figured since the, you know--

506
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,240
<17-22,RYAN>算了  你爱怎么想就怎么想吧
<17-22,RYAN>Fine. Just judge all you want.

507
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,990
<17-22,RYAN>我查到曼迪遇害那天是谁在她家
<17-22,RYAN>So I found out who Mandy was fighting with at her apartment

508
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,170
<17-22,RYAN>跟她吵架了
<17-22,RYAN>the day she died.

509
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,530
<17-22,RYAN>她家街对面的那家商店
<17-22,RYAN>The store across the street from her building

510
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,600
<17-22,RYAN>装了监控摄像
<17-22,RYAN>uses surveillance.

511
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,920
<17-22,RYAN>录像显示雷吉并没有出现在那
<17-22,RYAN>There was no sign of Reggie,

512
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,650
<17-22,RYAN>但是我发现了另一个熟悉的面孔
<17-22,RYAN>But I did see another familiar face--

513
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,010
<17-22,RYAN>WHNY的播报员迈尔斯·哈克斯顿
<17-22,RYAN>WHNY reporter Miles Haxton.

514
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,560
<18-1,MILES HAXTON>没错  那是我
<18-1,MILES HAXTON>Yeah, that's me.

515
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,410
<18-2,CASTLE>那么你去她家做什么呢
<18-2,CASTLE>So what were you doing at her place?

516
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,700
<18-3,BECKETT>曼迪的邻居们听到你们在吵架
<18-3,BECKETT>Mandy's neighbors overheard the two of you fighting.

517
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,300
<18-3,BECKETT>你们为什么要吵架
<18-3,BECKETT>What was it about?

518
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,010
<18-4,MILES>因为我们的关系
<18-4,MILES>Our relationship.

519
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,970
<18-5,BECKETT>你们在恋爱
<18-5,BECKETT>You were dating?

520
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,520
<18-7,BECKETT>你之前怎么不告诉我们
<18-7,BECKETT>Why didn't you tell us this before?

521
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,350
<18-8,MILES>因为我担心这件事会传出去
<18-8,MILES>'Cause I couldn't take the chance that it would get out.

522
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,670
<18-8,MILES>播报员和预报员搞到一起  绝不能传出去
<18-8,MILES>The--the reporter and the weather girl? No.

523
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,920
<18-8,MILES>电视台对办公室恋情有
<18-8,MILES>This--this station has a very strict policy

524
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,100
<18-8,MILES>很严格的纪律
<18-8,MILES>about interoffice dating.

525
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,890
<18-8,MILES>即使曼迪现在已经死了
<18-8,MILES>And even--even with what happened to Mandy,

526
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,660
<18-8,MILES>哈维仍然可能会把我停职的
<18-8,MILES>Harvey still would've suspended me.

527
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,680
<18-9,BECKETT>你们恋爱多少时间了
<18-9,BECKETT>How long had the two of you been seeing each other?

528
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,770
<18-10,MILES>有几个月了
<18-10,MILES>Couple months.

529
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,560
<18-11,CASTLE>你们的感情出了什么问题
<18-11,CASTLE>What went wrong?

530
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,920
<18-12,MILES>这是同事间搞地下情的通病
<18-12,MILES>Well, here's the thing about a secret workplace romance, okay?

531
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,720
<18-12,MILES>刚开始大家都很有激情
<18-12,MILES>In the beginning, you're on a high.

532
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,260
<18-12,MILES>每次偷情时的感觉就像给你的心脏
<18-12,MILES>Every stolen moment feels like a-a shot of adrenaline

533
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,330
<18-12,MILES>打了一针兴奋剂
<18-12,MILES>straight to the heart.

534
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,110
<18-12,MILES>甚至在上班路上都无比兴奋
<18-12,MILES>You--you get butterflies on your way into work.

535
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,850
<18-12,MILES>你感到既惊险又刺激
<18-12,MILES>It's exciting and dangerous,

536
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,010
<18-12,MILES>做爱时也很爽
<18-12,MILES>and the sex is amazing.

537
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,310
<18-13,CASTLE>然后呢
<18-13,CASTLE>And then what?

538
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,780
<18-14,MILES>然后我们自己会慢慢受不了
<18-14,MILES>And then it imploded.

539
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,350
<18-14,MILES>我们无法隐藏这么多的秘密
<18-14,MILES>We were never gonna keep up the secret.

540
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,560
<18-14,MILES>我们已经淹没在自己的各种谎言中了
<18-14,MILES>We were already drowning in all the lies we had to tell.

541
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,710
<18-15,BECKETT>你们的同事发现了你们的关系吗
<18-15,BECKETT>Did--did your coworkers ever find out?

542
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,000
<18-16,MILES>还没有
<18-16,MILES>Uh, not yet.

543
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,040
<18-16,MILES>但我要在这段感情毁掉
<18-16,MILES>But I-I had to stay out in front of it

544
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,300
<18-16,MILES>我们两个的事业之前结束它
<18-16,MILES>to keep it from destroying both of our careers.

545
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,020
<18-16,MILES>我是说我还有进阶国家电视网的机会
<18-16,MILES>I mean, I still have a-a shot at a national desk.

546
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,780
<18-17,BECKETT>但是曼迪却不想结束这段感情
<18-17,BECKETT>And Mandy didn't want it to end.

547
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,760
<18-18,CASTLE>她可能威胁你要去向哈维报告
<18-18,CASTLE>She could've threatened to tell Harvey.

548
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,830
<18-19,MILES>什么  不  不  你们在开玩笑吧
<18-19,MILES>What? No, no. Are you kidding?

549
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,260
<18-19,MILES>不是的  曼迪和我一样
<18-19,MILES>No, Mandy didn't want this to get out

550
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,630
<18-19,MILES>也不想让这事传出去
<18-19,MILES>Any more than I did.

551
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,080
<18-19,MILES>你们不会往外说的  对吧
<18-19,MILES>You're not gonna tell, are you?

552
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,400
<18-20,BECKETT>昨晚10:28你在哪里
<18-20,BECKETT>Where were you last night at 10:28?

553
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,580
<18-21,MILES>在丽嘉酒店参加
<18-21,MILES>Uh, at a press party at the Ritz-Carlton

554
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,710
<18-21,MILES>维嘉手机的新闻发布会
<18-21,MILES>for the launch of the Vega smartphone.

555
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,170
<18-22,CASTLE>曼迪有没有跟你说
<18-22,CASTLE>Did Mandy say anything to you

556
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,630
<18-22,CASTLE>前几天她去了一趟急诊室
<18-22,CASTLE>about going to the E.R. a couple days ago?

557
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,570
<18-23,MILES>没有  她没说  不过话说回来
<18-23,MILES>No, she didn't mention it, but then again,

558
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,690
<18-23,MILES>她上个周实在表现得很奇怪
<18-23,MILES>She was acting pretty strange last week.

559
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,590
<18-24,BECKETT>怎么个奇怪法
<18-24,BECKETT>What do you mean?

560
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,970
<18-25,MILES>她不肯告诉我  但是我觉得
<18-25,MILES>Well, she wouldn't tell me, but I had the feeling

561
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,250
<18-25,MILES>她不仅仅是因为我们的事而郁闷
<18-25,MILES>it was more than just us she was upset about.

562
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,280
<18-25,MILES>一定还有别的事烦着她
<18-25,MILES>There's something else that was bothering her.

563
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,950
<19-1,CASTLE>看起来化妆室那些女人说的
<19-1,CASTLE>Well, it looks like those makeup ladies

564
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,990
<19-1,CASTLE>关于曼迪有绯闻的事是真的
<19-1,CASTLE>were right about Mandy's affair,

565
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,370
<19-1,CASTLE>只是猜错了绯闻的对象
<19-1,CASTLE>They just had the wrong guy.

566
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,220
<19-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  关于他说的其他事你怎么想
<19-2,BECKETT>Castle, what about the other stuff that they said

567
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,930
<19-2,BECKETT>他说地下情迟早是要被揭穿的
<19-2,BECKETT>about how secret romances are impossible to keep hidden?

568
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,890
<19-2,BECKETT>你也听到了迈尔斯是怎么说的了
<19-2,BECKETT>I mean, you heard Miles.

569
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,540
<19-2,BECKETT>我不想被谎言憋到透不过气
<19-2,BECKETT>I don't want to drown in a sea of lies.

570
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,220
<19-3,CASTLE>别担心  嘴对嘴人工呼吸我在行
<19-3,CASTLE>Well, if it's any comfort to you, I do know mouth-to-mouth.

571
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,540
<19-4,BECKETT>埃斯波
<19-4,BECKETT>Hey, Espo.

572
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,360
<19-5,ESPOSITO>发现蹊跷之处
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Found something weird.

573
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,200
<19-5,ESPOSITO>给曼迪治疗的急诊医生那条线
<19-5,ESPOSITO>The E.R. Doc that treated Mandy?

574
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,250
<19-5,ESPOSITO>原来是治疗严重哮喘发作的
<19-5,ESPOSITO>It turns out it was for a severe asthma attack.

575
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,560
<19-6,BECKETT>这不奇怪  我们知道曼迪有哮喘
<19-6,BECKETT>That's not weird. We know that Mandy had asthma.

576
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,740
<19-6,BECKETT>因此她才没法上电视台的直升机
<19-6,BECKETT>That's why she couldn't go up in the station helicopter.

577
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,700
<19-7,ESPOSITO>接下来就是蹊跷的地方了
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Which brings me to the w-weird part.

578
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,130
<19-7,ESPOSITO>她是乘WHNY电视台的新闻直升机抵达急诊室
<19-7,ESPOSITO>She arrived at the E.R. in the WHNY news chopper.

579
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,190
<19-7,ESPOSITO>着陆后
<19-7,ESPOSITO>She landed on the helipad,

580
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,410
<19-7,ESPOSITO>飞行员扶她进去的
<19-7,ESPOSITO>and the pilot walked her inside.

581
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,820
<19-8,BECKETT>好  谢谢
<19-8,BECKETT>Okay. Thank you.

582
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,550
<19-9,CASTLE>她患有哮喘
<19-9,CASTLE>With her asthma,

583
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,790
<19-9,CASTLE>还坐直升机干嘛
<19-9,CASTLE>what was she doing up there

584
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,030
<19-9,CASTLE>怎么会没人知道
<19-9,CASTLE>and why did no one know about it?

585
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,630
<19-10,BECKETT>有一个人知情
<19-10,BECKETT>There is one person that knew about it,

586
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,300
<19-10,BECKETT>那个直升机飞行员
<19-10,BECKETT>the helicopter pilot.

587
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,280
<19-10,BECKETT>你去哪  帅哥
<19-10,BECKETT>Where you going, pretty boy?

588
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,180
<19-11,CASTLE>现在八点半
<19-11,CASTLE>It's 8:30.

589
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,020
<19-11,CASTLE>马上就到你和克里斯蒂娜的部分了
<19-11,CASTLE>It's time for your segment with Kristina.

590
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,430
<19-12,BECKETT>你该去化妆了
<19-12,BECKETT>Gotta get you into makeup.

591
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,330
<19-12,BECKETT>没关系  我去处理
<19-12,BECKETT>It's okay. I'll take care of it.

592
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,560
<19-13,CASTLE>好吧  我不在的时候别结案
<19-13,CASTLE>Okay. D-don't solve the case without me.

593
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,310
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>我不该那样做
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>Look, I wasn't supposed to, okay?

594
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,490
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>但几天前
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>But a few days ago,

595
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,780
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>她带着装有1000美元的信封来找我
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>she showed up with an envelope stuffed with 1,000 bucks,

596
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,440
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>说她只需调用直升机20分钟
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>said she needed the chopper only for 20 minutes,

597
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,660
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>还得保密
<20-1,HELICOPTER PILOT>and nobody could know.

598
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,180
<20-2,BECKETT>她说过为什么要用直升机吗
<20-2,BECKETT>Did she tell you why she needed it?

599
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,130
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>没有  不过一定相当重要
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>No, but it must have been important.

600
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,720
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>我喜欢曼迪
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>Look, I liked Mandy--

601
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,950
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>活泼  长得又好看
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>Bubbly, easy on the eyes.

602
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,320
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>我想帮她
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>I wanted to help her out.

603
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,780
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>但我们起飞后  她拿出了那些设备
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>But then we get up there, she's got all this equipment,

604
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,470
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>说想飞到泽西上空
<20-3,HELICOPTER PILOT>and she wants to fly over Jersey.

605
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,550
<20-4,BECKETT>为什么要去新泽西
<20-4,BECKETT>Why New Jersey?

606
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,500
<20-5,HELICOPTER PILOT>问倒我了
<20-5,HELICOPTER PILOT>Beats me.

607
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,310
<20-5,HELICOPTER PILOT>我只知道那样会耗掉更多的机油
<20-5,HELICOPTER PILOT>All I know is, it's more fuel,

608
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,100
<20-5,HELICOPTER PILOT>我上司也许会发现
<20-5,HELICOPTER PILOT>and my boss might notice.

609
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,360
<20-6,BECKETT>那你飞了吗
<20-6,BECKETT>Okay, so did you do it?

610
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,230
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>是的  我们在泽西上方盘旋了几分钟
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>Yeah. We were over Jersey for a few minutes,

611
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,610
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>之后她呼吸困难
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>but then she started breathing heavy.

612
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,330
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>她没带吸入器
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>She didn't have her inhaler,

613
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,770
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>于是我径直飞去了医院
<20-7,HELICOPTER PILOT>so I flew straight to the hospital.

614
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,040
<20-8,BECKETT>你知道她有什么企图吗
<20-8,BECKETT>D-do you have any idea what she was up to?

615
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,870
<20-8,BECKETT>不知道
<20-8,BECKETT>No.

616
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,290
<20-9,HELICOPTER PILOT>我跟她说我不想离开纽约的时候
<20-9,HELICOPTER PILOT>When I told her I didn't want to leave New York,

617
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,930
<20-9,HELICOPTER PILOT>她说"事关生死"
<20-9,HELICOPTER PILOT>she said, "It's a matter of life or death."

618
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,160
<20-9,HELICOPTER PILOT>她或许是对的
<20-9,HELICOPTER PILOT>I guess maybe she was right.

619
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,360
<21-1,CASTLE>我再也不会
<21-1,CASTLE>That was-- that was the last time

620
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,710
<21-1,CASTLE>带手提电脑去咖啡馆了
<21-1,CASTLE>I took my laptop into a coffee shop.

621
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,990
<21-1,CASTLE>那么
<21-1,CASTLE>So...

622
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,930
<21-2,KRISTINA>作为一位英俊潇洒的畅销小说作家
<21-2,KRISTINA>As a handsome, best-selling author,

<21-2,KRISTINA>I'm sure you must have women

624
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,250
<21-2,KRISTINA>对你投怀送抱
<21-2,KRISTINA>throwing themselves at you all the time.

625
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,700
<21-3,CASTLE>每个人都要背负各自的重任嘛
<21-3,CASTLE>Well, we all have our crosses to bear.

626
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,900
<21-4,BECKETT>是啊  你个苦行僧
<21-4,BECKETT>Yes, you are such a martyr.

627
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,860
<21-5,KRISTINA>就是说你现在没有意中人咯
<21-5,KRISTINA>So no one special in your life right now?

<21-7,KRISTINA>我憋了很久了
<21-7,KRISTINA>I've been wanting to ask you.

00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,050
<22-1,CASTLE>这是最完美的掩饰
<22-1,CASTLE>I'm telling you, it's the perfect cover.

647
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,930
<22-1,CASTLE>如果他们知道我和克里斯蒂娜约会
<22-1,CASTLE>No one's gonna suspect us

648
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,590
<22-1,CASTLE>没人会怀疑我们

<22-5,CASTLE>我打算带她去高级餐馆
<22-5,CASTLE>I'm taking her out to a fancy dinner,

654
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,300
<22-5,CASTLE>就是那种所有人都能看到我们的浪漫餐厅
<22-5,CASTLE>someplace romantic where everyone will see us,

655
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,620
<22-5,CASTLE>说不定会登在"第六页"上
<22-5,CASTLE>Maybe even end up on "Page Six."

657
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,840
<22-5,CASTLE>那该有多棒啊
<22-5,CASTLE>How great would that be?

659
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,580
<22-7,CASTLE>你没意见吧
<22-7,CASTLE>You are okay with this, right?

660
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,980
<22-8,BECKETT>没有  怎么了
<22-8,BECKETT>Yeah. Yeah. Why?

661
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,100
<22-8,BECKETT>问问而已
<22-8,BECKETT>Just askin'.

662
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,480
<22-9,CASTLE>曼迪的直升机之旅查到线索了吗
<22-9,CASTLE>So what did we learn about Mandy's helicopter ride?

663
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,850
<22-10,BECKETT>我们找到了她在公寓用的设备
<22-10,BECKETT>Well, we found the equipment that she used in her apartment.

664
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,910
<22-10,BECKETT>就是她从瑞贝卡·弗格那里偷来的设备
<22-10,BECKETT>It turns out, it's all the stuff she stole from Rebecca Fog.

665
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,390
<22-11,CASTLE>瑞贝卡·弗格
<22-11,CASTLE>Rebecca Fog.

666
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,060
<23-1,REBECCA>你是说那不是恶作剧
<23-1,REBECCA>But you mean, it wasn't a prank?

667
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,070
<23-1,REBECCA>她确实用了这些东西
<23-1,REBECCA>I mean, she actually used this stuff?

668
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,280
<23-3,REBECCA>-是的  -为什么
<23-3,REBECCA>- Ahem. -Why?

669
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,410
<23-4,BECKETT>我们希望你能帮我们解惑
<23-4,BECKETT>Well, we were hoping you could tell us.

670
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,670
<23-5,REBECCA>如果当时她是在直升机上
<23-5,REBECCA>Uh, well, if she was up in the chopper,

671
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,420
<23-5,REBECCA>她应该用了这台毒素监测器
<23-5,REBECCA>She must have been using the direct tox monitor.

672
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,450
<23-6,CASTLE>毒素监测器  当然了
<23-6,CASTLE>The direct tox monitor, of course.

673
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,110
<23-7,BECKETT>你根本就不知道那是什么
<23-7,BECKETT>You have no idea what that is.

674
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,550
<23-8,CASTLE>完全摸不着头脑
<23-8,CASTLE>No, not a clue. Mm-hmm.

675
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,910
<23-9,BECKETT>它是种检测空气质量的设备
<23-9,BECKETT>Uh, it's an instrument to test air quality.

676
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,680
<23-10,REBECCA>可她是个享有盛名的美女主播
<23-10,REBECCA>But she was a glorified spokesmodel.

677
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,440
<23-10,REBECCA>她到底在干什么
<23-10,REBECCA>What the hell was she up to?

678
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,840
<23-11,CASTLE>有办法查清楚吗
<23-11,CASTLE>Is there any way to find out?

679
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,000
<23-12,REBECCA>可以  监视器存储了测量数据
<23-12,REBECCA>Yeah, the, uh, monitor stores measured data.

680
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,860
<23-12,REBECCA>等等
<23-12,REBECCA>Whoa. Wait.

681
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,840
<23-12,REBECCA>-这不可能  -怎么了
<23-12,REBECCA>- Well, this can't be right. - What?

682
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,900
<23-14,REBECCA>数据显示有高浓度的苯乙烯
<23-14,REBECCA>It's indicating high levels of styrene.

683
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,370
<23-15,BECKETT>那不寻常吗
<23-15,BECKETT>And is that unusual?

684
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,950
<23-16,REBECCA>是的  苯乙烯是种危险的化学品
<23-16,REBECCA>Yeah, styrene's a dangerous chemical.

685
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,730
<23-16,REBECCA>长期接触会导致严重的呼吸系统的问题
<23-16,REBECCA>Prolonged exposure could lead to severe respiratory problems.

686
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,360
<23-17,CASTLE>比如哮喘
<23-17,CASTLE>Like asthma.

687
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,540
<23-18,BECKETT>曼迪一做完那个测试哮喘就发作了
<23-18,BECKETT>Mandy had an asthma attack right after she did that test.

688
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,210
<23-19,CASTLE>记得雷吉所说吗
<23-19,CASTLE>And remember Reggie's statement?

689
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,340
<23-19,CASTLE>他说曼迪在医院的时候
<23-19,CASTLE>He said Mandy was hanging out

690
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,980
<23-19,CASTLE>总和那些生病孩子在一起
<23-19,CASTLE>at the hospital with those sick kids.

691
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,220
<23-19,CASTLE>说不定两者有关联
<23-19,CASTLE>Maybe there's a connection.

692
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,860
<24-1,KID>她人很好
<24-1,KID>She was really nice.

693
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,950
<24-1,KID>她说她也得了很严重的哮喘
<24-1,KID>She said she had asthma, too,

694
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,000
<24-1,KID>她还说哮喘无法阻止我前行
<24-1,KID>and that it didn't have to hold me back.

695
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,820
<24-1,KID>每次医生来的时候  他们只和我妈交谈
<24-1,KID>When the doctors come in, they only talk to my mom.

696
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,410
<24-1,KID>只有那个天气预报员阿姨想和我聊天
<24-1,KID>The weather lady, she actually wanted to talk to me.

697
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,470
<24-2,BECKETT>她都问过你一些什么事
<24-2,BECKETT>And what kinds of things did she ask you about?

698
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,550
<24-3,KID>很多  学校还有朋友之类的
<24-3,KID>Lots of things, like school and friends.

699
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,640
<24-3,KID>上一次  她问我在哪里打棒球
<24-3,KID>Last time, she asked me where I played baseball.

700
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,460
<24-4,BECKETT>你怎么回答
<24-4,BECKETT>And what'd you tell her?

701
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,750
<24-5,KID>在康维运动场
<24-5,KID>Conway Field.

702
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,300
<24-6,BECKETT>她有没有说为什么问这个问题
<24-6,BECKETT>Did she tell you why she wanted to know?

703
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,080
<24-7,KID>她觉得那可能与我得哮喘有关
<24-7,KID>She thought it had something to do with my asthma.

704
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,920
<24-8,CASTLE>失陪
<24-8,CASTLE>Excuse me.

705
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,890
<24-9,RYAN>我与曼迪拜访过的每个孩子的母亲
<24-9,RYAN>Hey, so I just talked with the mothers of all the other patients

706
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,710
<24-9,RYAN>都逐一谈过
<24-9,RYAN>that Mandy visited with at the hospital,

707
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,740
<24-9,RYAN>她们都说了同一件事
<24-9,RYAN>and they all said the same thing--

708
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,150
<24-9,RYAN>曼迪问了他们关于在康维运动场练习的事
<24-9,RYAN>Mandy asked them about their practices at Conway Field.

709
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,980
<24-10,CASTLE>我来猜猜  康维运动场位于新泽西
<24-10,CASTLE>Let me guess. Conway Field's in New Jersey.

710
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,670
<24-11,RYAN>具体是在尤宁县
<24-11,RYAN>Union County to be exact.

711
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,900
<24-11,RYAN>我已经跟医院工作人员们谈过了
<24-11,RYAN>So I spoke with admissions at the hospital,

712
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,720
<24-11,RYAN>他们说尤宁县重症哮喘患者
<24-11,RYAN>and they said that numbers for severe asthma patients

713
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,280
<24-11,RYAN>数量在不断增加
<24-11,RYAN>are up for that neighborhood.

714
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,940
<24-12,CASTLE>作为一名患有哮喘的气象播报员
<24-12,CASTLE>Well, as a weather girl and someone with asthma,

715
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,140
<24-12,CASTLE>曼迪深知空气质量对
<24-12,CASTLE>Mandy would've understood the impact of air quality

716
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,470
<24-12,CASTLE>呼吸道疾病患者的影响
<24-12,CASTLE>on someone with respiratory illness.

717
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,720
<24-12,CASTLE>那纸条上写着
<24-12,CASTLE>The note said,

718
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,780
<24-12,CASTLE>"如果走漏半点风声  我就杀了你"
<24-12,CASTLE>"if any of this gets out, I'll kill you."

719
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,740
<24-12,CASTLE>假如曼迪发现了导致空气中含有苯乙烯
<24-12,CASTLE>What if Mandy found out what or who was responsible

720
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,040
<24-12,CASTLE>的罪魁祸首
<24-12,CASTLE>for the styrene in the air?

721
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,700
<24-13,RYAN>他们因此杀了她
<24-13,RYAN>It's possible they had her killed.

722
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,540
<25-1,RYAN>根据兰尼载曼迪采集
<25-1,RYAN>So based on the direction that Lenny traveled

723
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,360
<25-1,RYAN>空气样本飞过的地区来看
<25-1,RYAN>while Mandy took air samples,

724
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,480
<25-1,RYAN>他们经过的八家工厂都在康维运动场附近
<25-1,RYAN>they flew over eight factories, all near Conway Field.

725
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,020
<25-2,ESPOSITO>八家工厂之中  只有一家会产生苯乙烯
<25-2,ESPOSITO>And of the eight factories, only one produces styrene--

726
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,240
<25-2,ESPOSITO>卡祖利地毯公司
<25-2,ESPOSITO>Cazuli Carpeting.

727
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,300
<25-2,ESPOSITO>苯乙烯是他们加工过程中的化学副产品
<25-2,ESPOSITO>It's a chemical byproduct of their manufacturing.

728
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,390
<25-2,ESPOSITO>再看看他们家货单下方的图标
<25-2,ESPOSITO>And check out the bottom of one of their bills.

729
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,480
<25-2,ESPOSITO>眼熟吗
<25-2,ESPOSITO>Look familiar?

730
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,970
<25-3,BECKETT>他们的厂标和曼迪收到的
<25-3,BECKETT>Their logo has the same design

731
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,650
<25-3,BECKETT>死亡威胁上的一样
<25-3,BECKETT>that's on the death threat Mandy got.

732
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,390
<25-4,ESPOSITO>而且卡祖利地毯的所有者
<25-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and the owner of Cazuli Carpeting,

733
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,370
<25-4,ESPOSITO>乔治·卡祖利是个恐吓的老手
<25-4,ESPOSITO>George Cazuli, is no stranger to carrying out threats--

734
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,220
<25-4,ESPOSITO>人身攻击  虐待配偶
<25-4,ESPOSITO>Assault and battery, spousal abuse,

735
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,180
<25-4,ESPOSITO>把一个竞争对手的工厂烧个精光
<25-4,ESPOSITO>and the attempted arson of one of his competitor's factories.

736
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,320
<25-5,CASTLE>那就都说得通了
<25-5,CASTLE>Well, then it all makes perfect sense.

737
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,900
<25-5,CASTLE>一个火爆易怒的工厂主
<25-5,CASTLE>A hotheaded factory owner

738
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,990
<25-5,CASTLE>被理想主义的女气象播报员指控
<25-5,CASTLE>is confronted by an idealistic weather girl

739
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,980
<25-5,CASTLE>说他是导致空气有毒的罪魁祸首
<25-5,CASTLE>who accuses him of pumping poison into the air.

740
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,270
<25-6,BECKETT>如果她的指控公之于众
<25-6,BECKETT>And if her allegations went public,

741
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,610
<25-6,BECKETT>他就得面对刑事指控
<25-6,BECKETT>he'd face criminal charges,

742
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,960
<25-6,BECKETT>工厂也就倒闭了
<25-6,BECKETT>his factory would be shut down.

743
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,570
<25-7,CASTLE>只不过卡祖利先"毙"了她
<25-7,CASTLE>Only Cazuli shuts her down instead.

744
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,020
<26-1,BECKETT>卡祖利先生  请坐
<26-1,BECKETT>Mr. Cazuli, have a seat.

745
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,550
<26-1,BECKETT>我看过够多的《法律与秩序》
<26-1,BECKETT>I've seen enough episodes

746
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,450
<26-1,BECKETT>知道你们在盘算些什么
<26-1,BECKETT>of "Law & Order" to know how this works.

747
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,860
<26-2,BECKETT>你们想要诱导我说出一些
<26-2,BECKETT>You think you're gonna trick me

748
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,440
<26-2,BECKETT>有悖事实的话
<26-2,BECKETT>into saying something that ain't true?

749
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,870
<26-2,BECKETT>我告诉你们
<26-2,BECKETT>I'll tell you what,

750
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,290
<26-2,BECKETT>在律师来之前  我什么都不说
<26-2,BECKETT>I ain't saying another word till my lawyer gets here.

751
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,150
<26-2,BECKETT>没问题
<26-2,BECKETT>Not a problem.

752
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,910
<26-2,BECKETT>在您的律师到达之前  卡塞尔先生与我
<26-2,BECKETT>Mr. Castle and I will just use that time

753
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,940
<26-2,BECKETT>就利用这段时间研究一下您的档案吧
<26-2,BECKETT>to go through your file before your lawyer gets here.

754
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,180
<26-3,CASTLE>那样也许会有帮助
<26-3,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. That'll be helpful.

755
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,320
<26-4,BECKETT>档案真厚啊
<26-4,BECKETT>Wow. That's a thick file, huh?

756
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,740
<26-5,CASTLE>我们来看看
<26-5,CASTLE>Okay, let's see.

757
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,470
<26-6,BECKETT>六个月前  卡祖利公司改良了他们的地毯垫面技术
<26-6,BECKETT>Six months ago, Cazuli modified their carpet backing

758
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,280
<26-6,BECKETT>以延长产品的使用寿命
<26-6,BECKETT>to create a longer-lasting product.

759
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,780
<26-7,CASTLE>谁不想要超耐用的地毯呀
<26-7,CASTLE>Who doesn't want longer-lasting carpet?

760
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,230
<26-8,BECKETT>是的  可不幸的是  垫面的生产过程
<26-8,BECKETT>Yes, but unfortunately, this process

761
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,550
<26-8,BECKETT>会释放出一种叫苯乙烯的有害化学物质
<26-8,BECKETT>released a harmful chemical called styrene.

762
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,080
<26-8,BECKETT>小量的苯乙烯释放是正常的
<26-8,BECKETT>Now that's normal in small doses,

763
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,870
<26-8,BECKETT>但卡祖利工厂的释放量
<26-8,BECKETT>but in the case of Cazuli's factory,

764
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,130
<26-8,BECKETT>已经远远超过合法上限
<26-8,BECKETT>they were way over the legal limit.

765
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,210
<26-9,CASTLE>糟糕了
<26-9,CASTLE>Well, that's terrible.

766
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,250
<26-9,CASTLE>卡祖利先生知道这事吗
<26-9,CASTLE>Did Mr. Cazuli know?

767
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,580
<26-10,BECKETT>他怎么可能不知道
<26-10,BECKETT>You know, it's hard to imagine that he didn't, right?

768
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,590
<26-10,BECKETT>不管怎样  根据调查
<26-10,BECKETT>Anyway, according to this,

769
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,570
<26-10,BECKETT>当地气象播报员曼迪·麦克斯
<26-10,BECKETT>local weather girl Mandy Michaels

770
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,920
<26-10,BECKETT>把苯乙烯超量释放和哮喘患者数量上升
<26-10,BECKETT>made a connection between elevated levels of styrene

771
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,340
<26-10,BECKETT>联系起来
<26-10,BECKETT>and an increase in asthma cases.

772
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,440
<26-11,CASTLE>这对卡祖利公司来说可是个坏消息
<26-11,CASTLE>This is not sounding good for Cazuli.

773
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,610
<26-11,CASTLE>我在想  他知不知道她在调查这事
<26-11,CASTLE>You know, I wonder if he was aware she was looking into this.

774
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,660
<26-11,CASTLE>事实上
<26-11,CASTLE>As a matter of fact,

775
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,230
<26-12,BECKETT>卡祖利地毯公司的一个接待员
<26-12,BECKETT>a receptionist at Cazuli Carpeting

776
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,360
<26-12,BECKETT>接受警方询问称
<26-12,BECKETT>went on record saying that

777
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,400
<26-12,BECKETT>几天前曼迪曾来过工厂
<26-12,BECKETT>Mandy showed up at the factory a few days ago.

778
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,750
<26-12,BECKETT>我打赌她是去跟卡祖利对质这件事
<26-12,BECKETT>And I bet you she went there to confront Cazuli.

779
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,040
<26-13,CASTLE>卡祖利一定知道
<26-13,CASTLE>Cazuli had to know that

780
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,540
<26-13,CASTLE>要解决问题就得停止生产
<26-13,CASTLE>the cost of shutting down production

781
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,630
<26-13,CASTLE>而那样会给工厂带来巨大的损失
<26-13,CASTLE>to address the problem would've been sky-high.

782
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,020
<26-14,BECKETT>怪不得曼迪会收到恐吓信
<26-14,BECKETT>You know, that explains the threatening note that Mandy got.

783
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,390
<26-14,BECKETT>"如果走漏半点风声  我就杀了你"
<26-14,BECKETT>"If any of this gets out, I will kill you"?

784
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,690
<26-15,CASTLE>这图案和卡祖利地毯公司的标志一模一样
<26-15,CASTLE>Hey, this matches exactly the Cazuli Carpeting stationery.

785
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,140
<26-15,CASTLE>那就是她出现在公园的原因
<26-15,CASTLE>That's why she was at the park.

786
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,550
<26-16,BECKETT>环境保护署
<26-16,BECKETT>The Environmental Protection Agency's

787
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,360
<26-16,BECKETT>就在转角处
<26-16,BECKETT>right around the corner.

788
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,470
<26-17,CASTLE>我想你的假设是对的
<26-17,CASTLE>You know what? You might be right about that.

789
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,390
<26-17,CASTLE>之前我给环保署打电话时
<26-17,CASTLE>When I called them, they confirmed

790
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,630
<26-17,CASTLE>他们说曼迪本来要把一些东西
<26-17,CASTLE>that Mandy was on her way there

791
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,560
<26-17,CASTLE>送到他们那里的去检测
<26-17,CASTLE>to drop something in the after-hours box.

792
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,040
<26-18,BECKETT>我认为卡祖利为了自保而杀人灭口
<26-18,BECKETT>I think Cazuli killed her to keep her from turning him in.

793
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,170
<26-19,CAZOULLI>够了
<26-19,CAZOULLI>All right, enough!

794
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,640
<26-20,CAZOULLI>这个播报员在插手一些
<26-20,CAZOULLI>This broad was sticking her nose into something

795
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,860
<26-20,CAZOULLI>和她半点关系也没有的事
<26-20,CAZOULLI>that was none of her business.

796
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,640
<26-20,CAZOULLI>她带着她的那些破证据来见我
<26-20,CAZOULLI>She shows up, she's all high, she's all mighty

797
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,250
<26-20,CAZOULLI>一副道貌岸然的样子  我告诉她
<26-20,CAZOULLI>with her stupid-ass file of evidence, and I told her,

798
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,490
<26-20,CAZOULLI>告诉她"滚出去  别来瞎搅合"
<26-20,CAZOULLI>I told her to "scram, get outta here, beat it!"

799
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,900
<26-20,CAZOULLI>"如果再让我见到你在这一带晃悠
<26-20,CAZOULLI>"And if I ever see your face around here,

800
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,640
<26-20,CAZOULLI>我就要你好看"
<26-20,CAZOULLI>you're gonna regret it."

801
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,520
<26-20,CAZOULLI>我跟她说过这些
<26-20,CAZOULLI>I told her.

802
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,820
<26-20,CAZOULLI>她说  如果我不把工厂关闭
<26-20,CAZOULLI>She says to me, if I don't close everything down,

803
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,350
<26-20,CAZOULLI>她就要把我们曝光
<26-20,CAZOULLI>she's gonna expose us.

804
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,800
<26-20,CAZOULLI>那个破纸条
<26-20,CAZOULLI>The friggin' note--

805
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,700
<26-20,CAZOULLI>那个纸条只是想把她吓走
<26-20,CAZOULLI>The note was to scare her away a little bit.

806
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,260
<26-20,CAZOULLI>起效了不是吗
<26-20,CAZOULLI>Seemed to work, right?

807
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,640
<26-20,CAZOULLI>因为之后我再没听到她的消息
<26-20,CAZOULLI>'Cause I never heard from her again.

808
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,850
<26-20,CAZOULLI>够了  别缠着我
<26-20,CAZOULLI>Come on. Give me a break.

809
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,480
<26-20,CAZOULLI>我以为这破事都已经了结了
<26-20,CAZOULLI>I thought this mess was over with.

810
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,260
<26-21,BECKETT>谢谢您  卡祖利先生
<26-21,BECKETT>Thank you, Mr. Cazuli.

811
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,500
<26-22,CAZOULLI>干什么谢我
<26-22,CAZOULLI>Oh, yeah. For what?

812
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,910
<26-23,BECKETT>谢您承认了杀死曼迪的动机
<26-23,BECKETT>For admitting to motive

813
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,200
<26-23,BECKETT>及曾恐吓过她
<26-23,BECKETT>and to threatening Mandy.

814
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,990
<26-24,CAZOULLI>什么
<26-24,CAZOULLI>What?

815
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,400
<26-25,BECKETT>他就交给你了  律师先生
<26-25,BECKETT>He's all yours, counselor.

816
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,960
<26-26,CAZOULLI>你死哪儿去了
<26-26,CAZOULLI>Where you been?

817
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,460
<27-1,BECKETT>卡祖利的律师在为他超量释放苯乙烯商讨认罪减刑
<27-1,BECKETT>Cazuli's lawyer is looking for a plea on the styrene violation.

818
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,540
<27-2,CASTLE>那谋杀罪呢
<27-2,CASTLE>What about the murder rap?

819
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,360
<27-3,BECKETT>宣称他是清白的
<27-3,BECKETT>Claims he's innocent.

820
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,700
<27-4,ESPOSITO>不幸的是  我们无法确定案发当晚
<27-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but unfortunately, we got nothing

821
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,590
<27-4,ESPOSITO>卡祖利在案发现场
<27-4,ESPOSITO>that places Cazuli there the night of the murder.

822
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,530
<27-5,BECKETT>如果我们没有确凿的证据
<27-5,BECKETT>Look, if we can't physically tie him to it,

823
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,550
<27-5,BECKETT>这一切都是推断
<27-5,BECKETT>then all we have is speculation.

824
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,130
<27-5,BECKETT>没有证据  他就会被释放
<27-5,BECKETT>Without evidence, he's gonna walk.

825
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,260
<27-6,RYAN>这里有些东西你们得看看
<27-6,RYAN>There's something you're gonna want to take a look at.

826
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,700
<27-6,RYAN>卡祖利办公室的搜查令申请下来了
<27-6,RYAN>Search warrant came through on Cazuli's office.

827
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,480
<27-6,RYAN>我们发现了曼迪留给他的文件
<27-6,RYAN>We found the file that Mandy left with him.

828
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,180
<27-6,RYAN>在她的研究中
<27-6,RYAN>Now in her research

829
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,410
<27-6,RYAN>这张地毯厂烟囱的照片
<27-6,RYAN>is this picture of their smokestack.

830
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,020
<27-7,CASTLE>看起来是在地面上拍的
<27-7,CASTLE>It looks like it was taken at street level.

831
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,260
<27-8,RYAN>没错  现在再看看拍摄时间
<27-8,RYAN>Exactly. Now take a look at the timestamp.

832
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,600
<27-8,RYAN>这张照片摄于上周四
<27-8,RYAN>This picture was taken last Tuesday

833
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,690
<27-10,BECKETT>下午5:47
<27-10,BECKETT>5:47 p.m.

834
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,340
<27-8,RYAN>根据照片上太阳的位置
<27-8,RYAN>Based on the position of the sun,

835
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,670
<27-8,RYAN>技术部门说时间是正确的
<27-8,RYAN>tech confirmed that the time was correct.

836
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,630
<27-9,ESPOSITO>有什么意义吗
<27-9,ESPOSITO>Meaning what?

837
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,710
<27-10,BECKETT>这说明除非曼迪有分身术
<27-10,BECKETT>Meaning unless Mandy could be at two places at once,

838
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,270
<27-10,BECKETT>否则她不可能拍下这张照片
<27-10,BECKETT>she couldn't have taken that photo.

839
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,030
<27-10,BECKETT>5:47她正在直播气象
<27-10,BECKETT>She was on air at 5:47.

840
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,320
<27-11,RYAN>那么照片是谁拍的
<27-11,RYAN>So who took the picture.

841
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,930
<27-12,CASTLE>她有搭档
<27-12,CASTLE>She had a partner.

842
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,930
<27-13,BECKETT>所以曼迪才会对卡祖利说 "他们"会曝光他
<27-13,BECKETT>Which is why Mandy told Cazuli "they'd" expose him.

843
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,820
<27-14,ESPOSITO>如果她还有拍档
<27-14,ESPOSITO>Well, if she had a partner,

844
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,200
<27-14,ESPOSITO>那他们为什么还不现身呢
<27-14,ESPOSITO>then why haven't they come forward?

845
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,590
<27-15,CASTLE>也许他们被卡祖利吓到了
<27-15,CASTLE>Maybe they're afraid of Cazuli.

846
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,300
<27-16,RYAN>如果我们能找到他们
<27-16,RYAN>If we can find them,

847
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,480
<27-16,RYAN>他们或许有确凿的证据给卡祖利定罪
<27-16,RYAN>they might have some info on Cazuli that'll nail him.

848
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,780
<27-17,BECKETT>不如我们点份晚餐再研究一下
<27-17,BECKETT>You know what? Why don't we order dinner and work through?

849
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,840
<27-18,ESPOSITO>等下  卡塞尔
<27-18,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. Castle.

850
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,000
<27-18,ESPOSITO>今晚你不是要和克里斯蒂娜·科塔拉约会吗
<27-18,ESPOSITO>Don't you have a date with Kristina Coterra tonight?

<27-21,BECKETT>Yeah, well, don't let us keep you.

854

<27-22,CASTLE>我去赴约真的没问题吗
<27-22,CASTLE>Uh, are you sure you're okay-- are you okay with this?

855
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,210
<27-23,ESPOSITO>开玩笑吧  那可是克里斯蒂娜·科塔拉
<27-23,ESPOSITO>Okay? Are you kidding? It's Kristina Coterra.

856
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,930
<27-24,RYAN>再说  你什么时候让警务工作
<27-24,RYAN>Yeah, besides, since when have you let cop work

857
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,640

<28-2,CASTLE>I thought we were meeting at the restaurant?

868
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,650
<28-3,KRISTINA>我知道  但是这样更浪漫
<28-3,KRISTINA>I know, but this is so much more romantic--

<28-4,CASTLE>你带了牡蛎来
<28-4,CASTLE>Oh, wow. You got oysters in there?

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,780
<28-5,KRISTINA>帮我们助兴
<28-5,KRISTINA>To get us in the mood.

873

<28-5,KRISTINA>还有一些沾了巧克力的草莓
<28-5,KRISTINA>Also some chocolate-covered strawberries.

<28-5,KRISTINA>我
<28-5,KRISTINA>I...

875
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,360
<29-1,RYAN>我和电视台的人都谈过了
<29-1,RYAN>Well, I spoke with everyone at the station,

876
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,650
<29-1,RYAN>包括她男朋友
<29-1,RYAN>including her boyfriend.

877
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,360
<29-1,RYAN>没人承认是同伙
<29-1,RYAN>No one admits to being the partner

878
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,070
<29-1,RYAN>也没人知道她在干什么
<29-1,RYAN>or even knowing what she was working on.

879
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,050
<29-2,ESPOSITO>电话记录里也没什么线索
<29-2,ESPOSITO>There's nothing in her phone records either.

880
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,860
<29-3,BECKETT>我们肯定漏掉了什么
<29-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, there's gotta be something that we're missing.

881
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,320
<29-4,RYAN>说到缺了什么
<29-4,RYAN>Speaking of missing something,

882
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,260
<29-4,RYAN>今晚的约会卡塞尔应该超级兴奋才对啊
<29-4,RYAN>Castle should be way more excited about his date tonight.

883
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,300
<29-5,BECKETT>为什么
<29-5,BECKETT>Why?

884
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,630
<29-6,RYAN>《明星审查》上说
<29-6,RYAN>According to "Celebrity Examiner,"

885
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,170
<29-6,RYAN>克里斯蒂娜以她超多的比基尼收藏
<29-6,RYAN>Kristina is notorious for seducing famous men

886
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,020
<29-6,RYAN>勾引男明星而"声名"远扬
<29-6,RYAN>with her extensive bikini collection.

887
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,820
<29-8,RYAN>怎么了  是珍妮买的  放在咖啡桌上
<29-8,RYAN>What? Jenny buys it, and it just happened

888
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,240
<29-8,RYAN>恰好翻开在了那一页
<29-8,RYAN>to be open to that page on the coffee table.

889
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,990
<29-9,BECKETT>你想说什么呢
<29-9,BECKETT>What's your point?

890
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,850
<29-10,RYAN>还不明显吗
<29-10,RYAN>Isn't it obvious?

891
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,780
<29-10,RYAN>她今天肯定要对他用上这招
<29-10,RYAN>She's totally gonna put the moves on him.

892
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,740
<29-11,ESPOSITO>不可能  不会的
<29-11,ESPOSITO>No way. Not gonna happen.

893
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,310
<29-12,BECKETT>感谢你表现得成熟了一点点
<29-12,BECKETT>Thank you for actually showing some maturity.

894
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,210
<29-13,ESPOSITO>肯定是卡塞尔先下手为强
<29-13,ESPOSITO>He's totally gonna put the moves on her.

895
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,950
<29-14,BECKETT>难道你们不觉得他现在干不出那种事了吗
<29-14,BECKETT>Don't you guys think that he's actually evolved beyond that by now?

896
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,740
<29-15,ESPOSITO>他是个男人  他还活着  所以
<29-15,ESPOSITO>He's a man, he has a pulse, so...

897
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,120
<29-15,ESPOSITO>不觉得
<29-15,ESPOSITO>No.

898
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,230
<29-15,ESPOSITO>你知道吗
<29-15,ESPOSITO>You know,

899
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,780
<30-1,KRISTINA>自从我在红地毯上看到你
<30-1,KRISTINA>ever since I saw you on that red carpet--

900
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,680
<30-1,KRISTINA>你的面容
<30-1,KRISTINA>Mm, that face of yours--

901
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,240
<30-1,KRISTINA>我一直等着这一刻
<30-1,KRISTINA>I have been waiting to do this.

902
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,620
<30-2,CASTLE>既然你都等了
<30-2,CASTLE>Well, if you've been waiting

903
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,320
<30-2,CASTLE>那么久了  不如再多等几分钟
<30-2,CASTLE>that long, why not wait a few minutes more?

904
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,900
<30-3,KRISTINA>你要去哪
<30-3,KRISTINA>Where you going?

905
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,610
<30-4,CASTLE>去冰箱把草莓放进去
<30-4,CASTLE>To the fridge to put away these strawberries.

906
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,310
<30-4,CASTLE>可不想让巧克力都化掉
<30-4,CASTLE>Wouldn't want the chocolate to melt.

907
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,070
<30-5,KRISTINA>至于巧克力我能想到更好的用途哦
<30-5,KRISTINA>I can think of a better use for that chocolate.

908
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,400
<30-5,KRISTINA>好了
<30-5,KRISTINA>Okay.

<30-6,CASTLE>Kristina, let's talk about this for a second.

00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,920
<31-1,KRISTINA>你想要谈谈吗
<31-1,KRISTINA>Oh, you want to talk?

911
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,580
<31-2,CASTLE>我只是...  我们
<31-2,CASTLE>Well, I just-- what are we--

912
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,080
<31-2,CASTLE>我们这是在干吗
<31-2,CASTLE>What are we-- what are we doing here?

913
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,960
<31-2,CASTLE>卡塞尔  约会如何
<31-2,CASTLE>Hey, Castle. How's your date?

914
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,210

917
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,790
<34-1,CASTLE>别担心
<34-1,CASTLE>Don't worry.

918
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,990
<34-2,KRISTINA>我来搞定
<34-2,KRISTINA>I got it.

919
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,410
<34-3,CASTLE>我来帮忙  我来帮忙
<34-3,CASTLE>Okay, I'll help. I'll help.

920
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,380
<35-1,CASTLE>你拨通了理查德·卡塞尔的电话  你真幸运
<35-1,CASTLE>Hi, you've reached Richard Castle. Lucky you.

921
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,850
<36-1,KRISTINA>既然已经清理干净了
<36-1,KRISTINA>Now that that's out of the way,

922
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,970
<36-1,KRISTINA>我们刚刚进行到哪了
<36-1,KRISTINA>where were we?

923
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,610
<36-2,CASTLE>牡蛎
<36-2,CASTLE>Oysters.

924
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,060
<36-3,KRISTINA>跳过牡蛎吧
<36-3,KRISTINA>Ooh, let's skip the oysters.

925
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,480
<36-4,CASTLE>确定吗  因为我恰好
<36-4,CASTLE>Really? 'cause I happen to be--

926
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,070
<36-5,KRISTINA>你干嘛要欲擒故纵呢
<36-5,KRISTINA>Why are you playing so hard to get?

927
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,380
<36-6,CASTLE>我真的没有  我只是
<36-6,CASTLE>I'm really not. I just--

928
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,280
<36-7,KRISTINA>你有
<36-7,KRISTINA>You are.

929
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,500
<36-8,CASTLE>从来没有男人拒绝过我
<36-8,CASTLE>You know, no man has ever said no to me.

930
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,880
<36-9,KRISTINA>曾经有一个
<36-9,KRISTINA>Well... there was one.

931
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,710
<36-10,CASTLE>真的吗  似乎是个有趣的故事
<36-10,CASTLE>Really? That sounds like an interesting story.

932
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,070
<36-10,CASTLE>说说吧  他怎么得逞的
<36-10,CASTLE>Tell me about him. How did he get away?

933
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,370
<36-11,KRISTINA>我向你保证
<36-11,KRISTINA>I assure you...

934
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,850
<36-11,KRISTINA>绝对不是我的问题
<36-11,KRISTINA>It had nothing to do with me.

935
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,760
<36-11,KRISTINA>卡塞尔
<36-11,KRISTINA>Castle?

936
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,370
<37-1,BECKETT>我...
<37-1,BECKETT>I, uh...

937
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,760
<37-2,CASTLE>我知道谁是凶手了
<37-2,CASTLE>Uh, I know who the killer is.

938
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,590
<37-2,CASTLE>我尝试了一切办法来摆脱她
<37-2,CASTLE>Look, I tried everything to get away.

939
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,200
<38-1,CASTLE>我躲在了吧台下面
<38-1,CASTLE>I-I hid under the counter.

940
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,420
<38-1,CASTLE>躲进了浴室
<38-1,CASTLE>I was hiding in the bathroom.

941
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,350
<38-1,CASTLE>我还试图
<38-1,CASTLE>At one point, I tried to pull

942
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,760
<38-1,CASTLE>在钢琴下演出《恐怖角》的情节
<38-1,CASTLE>a "Cape Fear" up under the piano.

943
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,220
<38-2,BECKETT>但是我进去的时候
<38-2,BECKETT>Yet when I walked in,

944
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,830
<38-2,BECKETT>她在沙发上跨坐在你身上
<38-2,BECKETT>she was straddling you on the couch.

945
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,960
<38-3,CASTLE>她就像欲望终结者
<38-3,CASTLE>Right? She's like the terminator of sexpots.

946
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,210
<38-4,BECKETT>那是什么意思
<38-4,BECKETT>What is that even supposed to mean,

947
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,700
<38-4,BECKETT>她一个劲儿地套近乎吗
<38-4,BECKETT>she just keeps on coming?

948
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,880
<38-5,CASTLE>不  我  那是
<38-5,CASTLE>No, I--that's...

949
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,240
<38-6,CASTLE>我会答应这个约会的唯一理由
<38-6,CASTLE>The only reason I went on the date in the first place

950
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,720
<38-6,CASTLE>是因为你觉得在众人面前保持单身很重要
<38-6,CASTLE>was because you made a big deal about being single in public.

951
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,120
<38-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我有12通未接电话
<38-7,BECKETT>Castle, I have 12 missed phone calls

952
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,310
<38-7,BECKETT>都是那个体育播报员打来的
<38-7,BECKETT>from chip the sportscaster

953
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,940
<38-7,BECKETT>都是因为他以为我单身
<38-7,BECKETT>because he thinks that I'm single,

954
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,590
<38-7,BECKETT>但那并不意味着
<38-7,BECKETT>but that doesn't mean

955
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,670
<38-7,BECKETT>我要让他穿着泳裤骑在我身上
<38-7,BECKETT>that I'm gonna let him mount me in his speedos

956
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,290
<38-7,BECKETT>来证明我单身
<38-7,BECKETT>just to prove it.

957
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,250
<38-8,CASTLE>你没告诉我他给你打电话了
<38-8,CASTLE>You didn't tell me he called.

958
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,480
<38-9,BECKETT>不是吧  你还想打吃醋牌
<38-9,BECKETT>Really? You're gonna play the jealousy card now?

959
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,220
<38-10,CASTLE>听着  我会补偿你的  好吗
<38-10,CASTLE>Okay, look, I'll make it up to you, all right?

960
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,370
<38-10,CASTLE>你想要什么都行
<38-10,CASTLE>Whatever you want.

961
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,520
<38-11,BECKETT>我想要的是
<38-11,BECKETT>What I want is not to have

962
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,940
<38-11,BECKETT>不想脑海中出现你的脸
<38-11,BECKETT>this image of a bikini-clad woman

963
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,360
<38-11,BECKETT>夹在比基尼女的双峰之间
<38-11,BECKETT>stuffing her boobs in your face.

964
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,830
<38-11,BECKETT>想办法实现吧
<38-11,BECKETT>So good luck with that.

965
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,900
<38-12,CASTLE>人家查出凶手都不给甜头吗
<38-12,CASTLE>Don't I even get credit for figuring out who the killer is?

966
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,580
<38-13,BECKETT>不给
<38-13,BECKETT>No.

967
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,690
<38-14,REBECCA>本周随后几天  将有增温趋势
<38-14,REBECCA>Later in the week, we'll be seeing a warming trend.

968
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,060
<38-15,BECKETT>哈克斯顿先生
<38-15,BECKETT>Mr. Haxton.

969
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,750
<38-15,BECKETT>能借一步说话吗
<38-15,BECKETT>Can we have a word?

970
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,630
<38-16,MILES>我要直播头条新闻了
<38-16,MILES>Uh, I'm about to go live with a story.

971
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,650
<38-17,BECKETT>我们也是
<38-17,BECKETT>So are we.

972
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,080
<39-1,CASTLE>我和克里斯蒂娜·科塔拉进行了一场有趣的对话
<39-1,CASTLE>I just had a very interesting conversation with Kristina Coterra.

973
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,620
<39-1,CASTLE>她告诉我  你是唯一一个
<39-1,CASTLE>She told me that you are the one man

974
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,690
<39-1,CASTLE>拒绝了她的男人
<39-1,CASTLE>who's rejected her advances in the past.

975
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,740
<39-2,BECKETT>对  唯一的男人
<39-2,BECKETT>Yep, the one man.

976
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,480
<39-3,MILES>我不知道这有何关系
<39-3,MILES>Well, I don't see how that's relevant.

977
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,170
<39-4,CASTLE>她的自尊心受了创伤
<39-4,CASTLE>Well, her pride was hurt

978
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,730
<39-4,CASTLE>于是她调查了一番
<39-4,CASTLE>So she did a little digging.

979
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,070
<39-4,CASTLE>发现你的确有一段地下恋情
<39-4,CASTLE>Turns out, you did have a secret relationship,

980
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,320
<39-4,CASTLE>只不过不是跟曼迪
<39-4,CASTLE>Just not with Mandy.

981
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,040
<39-4,CASTLE>她发现你有一个不为人知的男友
<39-4,CASTLE>She discovered you have a boyfriend that no one here knows about.

982
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,140
<39-5,MILES>我的私生活跟你们没关系
<39-5,MILES>Well, my... personal life's none of your business.

983
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,980
<39-6,BECKETT>通常情况下  是的  但是
<39-6,BECKETT>Normally, yes, but it became our business

984
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,520
<39-6,BECKETT>当我们发现你对我们说谎时  就有关系了
<39-6,BECKETT>when we found out that you lied to us

985
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,240
<39-6,BECKETT>关于你为什么去曼迪的公寓
<39-6,BECKETT>about why you were at Mandy's apartment

986
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,860
<39-6,BECKETT>以及你们争吵的原因你都说谎了
<39-6,BECKETT>and about what you were fighting over.

987
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,660
<39-6,BECKETT>-是你拍了这张照片吗  -不是
<39-6,BECKETT>- Now did you take this photo? - No.

988
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,470
<39-7,MILES>那就有趣了
<39-7,MILES>Wow, that's funny.

989
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,790
<39-8,CASTLE>因为在你的公寓我们发现了一部相机
<39-8,CASTLE>Because a search of your apartment turned up a camera

990
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,350
<39-8,CASTLE>既有这张还有很多其他的照片
<39-8,CASTLE>with this and other photos on it.

991
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,730
<39-9,BECKETT>她是你的搭档
<39-9,BECKETT>She was your partner.

992
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,030
<39-9,BECKETT>她在帮你搜集资料
<39-9,BECKETT>She was helping you with a story,

993
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,400
<39-9,BECKETT>你为什么不报案
<39-9,BECKETT>So why didn't you come forward?

994
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
<39-10,CASTLE>只有一个我能想到的原因
<39-10,CASTLE>Well, there's only one conceivable reason--

995
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,290
<39-10,CASTLE>因为是你杀了她
<39-10,CASTLE>Because you killed her.

996
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,010
<39-11,MILES>她是我的同事和朋友
<39-11,MILES>She was a colleague and a friend.

997
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,440
<39-11,MILES>我为什么要杀她
<39-11,MILES>Why would I kill her?

998
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,340
<39-12,CASTLE>因为她发现了惊天内幕
<39-12,CASTLE>Because she uncovered the expose of a lifetime.

999
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,840
<39-12,CASTLE>这么爆炸性的事件  必须经过法律部门的核实
<39-12,CASTLE>A story that big, it has to be vetted by legal,

1000
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,800
<39-12,CASTLE>那要花上几周  甚至几个月的时间
<39-12,CASTLE>that can take weeks, even months.

1001
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,170
<39-13,BECKETT>但是曼迪等不了那么久
<39-13,BECKETT>But Mandy couldn't wait that long,

1002
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,660
<39-13,BECKETT>因为孩子们不断患病
<39-13,BECKETT>not while kids were getting sick.

1003
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,360
<39-13,BECKETT>所以她决定把证据交给美国环保署
<39-13,BECKETT>So she decided to turn the findings over to the E.P.A.

1004
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,630
<39-14,CASTLE>那样的话
<39-14,CASTLE>At which point,

1005
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,590
<39-14,CASTLE>你就没了独家报道
<39-14,CASTLE>you lose your big exclusive.

1006
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,960
<39-14,CASTLE>你什么时候有过独家报道啊
<39-14,CASTLE>Now when was the last time you had a big exclusive?

1007
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,590
<39-15,MILES>这太疯狂了
<39-15,MILES>This is crazy.

1008
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,550
<39-15,MILES>太扯了
<39-15,MILES>No, this is crazy.

1009
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,660
<39-15,MILES>你们认为我为了报道杀了人吗
<39-15,MILES>You--you think I killed someone for a story.

1010
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,290
<39-16,BECKETT>我们知道凶手是你
<39-16,BECKETT>We know it was you, Miles.

1011
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,850
<39-16,BECKETT>我们发现了多处枪击残留物
<39-16,BECKETT>We found gunshot residue on the clothes in your hamper,

1012
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,820
<39-16,BECKETT>在滑雪面具上
<39-16,BECKETT>on the ski mask,

1013
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,450
<40-17,ESPOSITO>衬衫上
<40-17,ESPOSITO>the shirt.

1014
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,480
<40-18,ESPOSITO>你们得明白
<40-18,ESPOSITO>You have to understand...

1015
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,570
<39-17,MILES>那是意外
<39-17,MILES>It was an accident.

1016
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,370
<39-17,MILES>我只是想吓吓她
<39-17,MILES>I only meant to scare her.

1017
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,930
<39-17,MILES>我想如果我能把材料拿回来
<39-17,MILES>I thought if I could just get those files back,

1018
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,930
<39-17,MILES>就能阻止她
<39-17,MILES>I could stop her.

1019
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,020
<39-17,MILES>我就可以像她保证那样爆独家新闻了
<39-17,MILES>I'd be able to break the story like she promised.

1020
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,860
<39-17,MILES>但是她跟我拉扯起来
<39-17,MILES>But she fought me.

1021
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,370
<39-17,MILES>她奋力反抗  她过来夺枪
<39-17,MILES>She fought me, and she went and grabbed for the gun.

1022
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,300
<39-17,MILES>她干嘛要反抗
<39-17,MILES>Why would she fight me?

1023
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,340
<39-17,MILES>我是说我都不知道枪上膛了
<39-17,MILES>I mean, I-I didn't even know the gun was loaded.

1024
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,920
<40-1,CASTLE>电视台经理确认了
<40-1,CASTLE>Well, the station manager confirmed,

1025
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,610
<40-1,CASTLE>迈尔斯职位本就岌岌可危
<40-1,CASTLE>Miles was on thin ice.

1026
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,930
<40-1,CASTLE>想要挽救职业生涯的唯一办法
<40-1,CASTLE>The only way he could save his career

1027
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,610
<40-1,CASTLE>就是一则爆炸性新闻
<40-1,CASTLE>was to break a splashy story,

1028
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,560
<40-1,CASTLE>所以他跟曼迪达成协议帮助她
<40-1,CASTLE>So he made a deal with Mandy to help her

1029
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,020
<40-1,CASTLE>换取独家报道的机会
<40-1,CASTLE>in exchange for the exclusive.

1030
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,900
<40-2,BECKETT>之后她背叛了他
<40-2,BECKETT>Right, and then when she betrayed him,

1031
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,310
<40-2,BECKETT>他从新闻发布会派对溜出去与她对质
<40-2,BECKETT>He snuck out of the press party to confront her,

1032
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,330
<40-2,BECKETT>之后事情就急转直下
<40-2,BECKETT>and then things just got bad from there.

1033
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,260
<40-3,RYAN>我得说
<40-3,RYAN>I've gotta say,

1034
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,590
<40-3,RYAN>曼迪调查时很勇敢
<40-3,RYAN>pretty brave of Mandy to take up that cause.

1035
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,420
<40-3,RYAN>完全不像是人们说的那样
<40-3,RYAN>Not what you'd expect from what people said about her.

1036
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,610
<40-4,ESPOSITO>她的同事都以为很了解她  真是好笑
<40-4,ESPOSITO>It's funny how her coworkers thought they knew her so well,

1037
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:49,030
<40-4,ESPOSITO>她隐瞒他们过着神秘的生活
<40-4,ESPOSITO>and she had this whole secret life she was hiding from 'em.

1038
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,430
<40-4,ESPOSITO>是啊
<40-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

<40-15,CHIP>This is what happens when you try

1053

<40-18,ESPOSITO>你不必那样做的
<40-18,ESPOSITO>You didn't have to do that.

1058
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,840
<40-19,RYAN>那是搭档该做的  不是吗
<40-19,RYAN>Well, it's what partners do, right?

1066
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,580
<41-2,CASTLE>我该拒绝她的
<41-2,CASTLE>I-I... I should've said no.

1067
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,730
<41-3,BECKETT>那你为什么不拒绝
<41-3,BECKETT>Then why didn't you?

1068
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,090
<41-4,CASTLE>我不在行啊  我是说假装单身
<41-4,CASTLE>Well, I'm no good at this. Pretending to be single--

1069

<41-5,BECKETT>好吧  卡塞尔  我也不在行
<41-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but, castle, neither am I.

1070
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,370
<41-5,BECKETT>我最不想担心的事就是
<41-5,BECKETT>And the last thing I want to do

1071
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,270
<41-5,BECKETT>你跟其他女人在一起
<41-5,BECKETT>is have to worry about you with other women.

1072
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,770
<41-6,CASTLE>我事先声明  我没打算跟她上床
<41-6,CASTLE>Well, uh, for the record, I-I wasn't gonna sleep with her.

1073
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,750
<41-7,BECKETT>我知道
<41-7,BECKETT>I know.

1074
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,310
<41-8,BECKETT>那不是我要说的
<41-8,BECKETT>Look, that's not even the point.

1075
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,560
<41-8,BECKETT>我要说的是
<41-8,BECKETT>The point is, is...

1076
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,550
<41-8,BECKETT>我无所是从
<41-8,BECKETT>I don't even know how to do this.

1077
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,130
<41-8,BECKETT>你还记得迈尔斯说过
<41-8,BECKETT>Do you remember when Miles said that

1078
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,450
<41-8,BECKETT>地下恋情终会崩塌
<41-8,BECKETT>It's inevitable that this will fall apart,

1079
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,820
<41-8,BECKETT>注定会承受不住压力
<41-8,BECKETT>That it's destined to implode?

1080
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,520
<41-9,CASTLE>我要提醒你
<41-9,CASTLE>Uh, just a reminder,

1081
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,970
<41-9,CASTLE>迈尔斯是个说谎的凶手
<41-9,CASTLE>Miles is a lying killer.

1082
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,810
<41-9,CASTLE>但是
<41-9,CASTLE>But...

1083
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,690
<41-10,CASTLE>也许他们会发现
<41-10,CASTLE>Okay, maybe people find out,

1084
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,100
<41-10,CASTLE>也许我们无法在一起工作
<41-10,CASTLE>and maybe we won't get to work together,

1085
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,260
<41-10,CASTLE>也许我们会承受不了
<41-10,CASTLE>and maybe we'll implode.

1086
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,080
<41-10,CASTLE>但我们也有可能一直美好下去啊
<41-10,CASTLE>Or maybe we'll continue to be amazing.

1087
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,910
<41-10,CASTLE>重点是  我们没有答案
<41-10,CASTLE>The point is, we don't have the answers.

1088
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,730
<41-10,CASTLE>我们得带着问题去生活
<41-10,CASTLE>We just have to live with the questions and...

1089
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,820
<41-10,CASTLE>找到答案
<41-10,CASTLE>Find our way.

1090
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,140
<41-11,BECKETT>好吧
<41-11,BECKETT>Okay, can...

1091
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,030
<41-11,BECKETT>那我们这样吧
<41-11,BECKETT>Well, can we just start here then?

1092
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,580
<41-11,BECKETT>我们嘴上说在跟别人约会
<41-11,BECKETT>Can we say that we will talk about dating other people,

1093
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,220
<41-11,BECKETT>但其实没有跟别人约会
<41-11,BECKETT>but we won't actually date other people?

1094
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,650
<41-12,CASTLE>我能做到
<41-12,CASTLE>Yeah. I--no, I can do that.

1095
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,020
<41-13,BECKETT>很好  反正我有枪
<41-13,BECKETT>Okay, good, because I have a gun,

1096
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,200
<41-13,BECKETT>你别无选择
<41-13,BECKETT>and you don't really have a choice.

1097
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,190
<41-14,CASTLE>-这很明显  -是的
<41-14,CASTLE>- Clearly, I don't have a choice. - No.

1098
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,840
<41-15,BECKETT>抱歉
<41-15,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

1099
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,020
<41-15,BECKETT>亲不了
<41-15,BECKETT>I can't.

1100
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,870
<41-16,BECKETT>才刚刚发生
<41-16,BECKETT>It's--it's too soon.

1101
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,020
<41-16,BECKETT>我总是看到夹在她双峰间的你的脸
<41-16,BECKETT>I just--I keep seeing her boobs in your face.
