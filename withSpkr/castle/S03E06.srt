7
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,450
<6-14,MCCARDLE>我真是全身散发着粗旷美啊  是不
<6-14,MCCARDLE>I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,580
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>那艾什利呢
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>What about Ashley?

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,970
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>我是说  我该告诉他吗
<1-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>I mean, shouldn't I tell him?

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,360
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>宝贝  感情的事
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Darling, in matters of the heart,

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,200
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>最好不要想太多
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>it's best not to overthink things.

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,110
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>妈  那是你根据以往经验给出的建议吗
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>That's your advice, mother, with your track record?

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,740
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>听她的恋爱建议
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>What chasm of doom has she led you to

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,560
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>会让你万劫不复
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>by way of her tips on romance?

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,350
<1-4,MARTHA>我们刚才恰好在讨论
<1-4,MARTHA>As it happens, we were discussing

27
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,480
<1-4,MARTHA>如何应对神秘仰慕者
<1-4,MARTHA>secret admirer etiquette.

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,610
<1-5,CASTLE>有人暗恋你吗
<1-5,CASTLE>You have a secret admirer?

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,400
<1-6,ALEXIS>我总以为暗恋很傻
<1-6,ALEXIS>I always thought it was silly,

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,840
<1-6,ALEXIS>但现在我觉得蛮有意思的
<1-6,ALEXIS>but now I'm kind of intrigued.

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,010
<1-7,MARTHA>总之无需告诉艾什利
<1-7,MARTHA>And there is no need to tell Ashley.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,570
<1-8,CASTLE>这个暗恋者到底是怎样
<1-8,CASTLE>How exactly does a secret

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,600
<1-8,CASTLE>向你表达爱慕的啊
<1-8,CASTLE>admirer express his admiration?

34
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,580
<1-9,ALEXIS>他留了张纸条在我的存物柜
<1-9,ALEXIS>He left a note in my locker.

35
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,620
<1-9,ALEXIS>"当你走在走廊上
<1-9,ALEXIS>"As you walked down the hall,

36
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,820
<1-9,ALEXIS>斑驳的阳光掠过你亚麻色的马尾
<1-9,ALEXIS>a shard of sunlight glanced off your rope of flaxen hair

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,330
<1-9,ALEXIS>照得明亮晃眼  我便陶醉了"
<1-9,ALEXIS>and set it aglow, and I was enchanted."

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,850
<1-10,MARTHA>噢  写得太诗意了
<1-10,MARTHA>Oh, that's so poetic.

39
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,930
<1-11,ALEXIS>我想亚麻色的马尾是指法式麻花辫
<1-11,ALEXIS>I figure the rope of flaxen hair is my french braid,

40
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,380
<1-11,ALEXIS>我只在体育课后才这样扎
<1-11,ALEXIS>which I only wore after gym class,

41
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,130
<1-11,ALEXIS>所以说  他是在第四五节课之间
<1-11,ALEXIS>which means he saw me in the hall

42
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,320
<1-11,ALEXIS>在一楼的走廊上看见我的
<1-11,ALEXIS>on the first floor between fourth and fifth period.

43
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,430
<1-12,CASTLE>等等  你这是在干嘛
<1-12,CASTLE>Wait a minute. What are you doing?

44
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,100
<1-13,ALEXIS>缩小嫌疑人范围
<1-13,ALEXIS>Narrowing down suspects.

45
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,120
<1-14,CASTLE>不  你怎能这样做
<1-14,CASTLE>No, you can't do that.

46
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,590
<1-14,CASTLE>那样会摧毁秘密的
<1-14,CASTLE>No, you-- no, that'll ruin the secret.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,910
<1-14,CASTLE>这事就像是一部悬疑小说
<1-14,CASTLE>No, it's like a mystery novel.

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,290
<1-14,CASTLE>-你不能直奔结局  对吧  -不对
<1-14,CASTLE>-You don't just go to the last page, do you? -Yes.

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,320
<1-15,ALEXIS>你真会这样
<1-15,ALEXIS>You do?

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,820
<1-15,ALEXIS>你不该这样  你不能...
<1-15,ALEXIS>Well, you shouldn't. It's not--you can't--

51
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,380
<1-16,CASTLE>真相大白就没意思了
<1-16,CASTLE>The--the joy doesn't come in knowing who did it.

52
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,810
<1-16,CASTLE>等待的过程才有乐趣
<1-16,CASTLE>The joy comes in the journey,

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,960
<1-16,CASTLE>让结局
<1-16,CASTLE>in allowing the ending

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,280
<1-16,CASTLE>如动人的喜马拉雅山蓝罂粟般绽放
<1-16,CASTLE>to blossom like some magnificent himalayan blue poppy,

55
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,190
<1-16,CASTLE>-如...  -好了
<1-16,CASTLE>- like a-- - Okay.

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,840
<1-17,ALEXIS>好吧  我不会揭开谜底的
<1-17,ALEXIS>Okay. I'll let him stay a secret.

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,210
<1-18,CASTLE>听我的准没错  你会感谢我的
<1-18,CASTLE>Mark my words. You'll thank me.

58
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,570
<1-18,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<1-18,CASTLE>Castle.

59
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,170
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>本案的受害人叫琳达·罗素
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>So our victim is Linda Russo.

60
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,590
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>她是一家电视公司的客户关系专员
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>She's a customer relations worker at a cable company.

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,030
<2-2,CASTLE>也许有人对他们的服务不满
<2-2,CASTLE>Maybe someone was unsatisfied with their service.

62
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,260
<2-3,BECKETT>-我也是这么想的  -真的吗
<2-3,BECKETT>- Yeah, that's what I was thinking. - You were?

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
<2-5,BECKETT>清洁工在一堆盒子下面
<2-5,BECKETT>Sanitation workers found her body

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,330
<2-5,BECKETT>发现她的尸体
<2-5,BECKETT>under a couple of boxes.

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,810
<2-5,BECKETT>她住在两个街口外的24街和10街那边
<2-5,BECKETT>She lives 2 blocks away, over at 24th and 10th.

66
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,580
<2-5,BECKETT>看来她当时正在回家路上
<2-5,BECKETT>Looks like she was on her way home.

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,130
<2-5,BECKETT>早  蕾妮
<2-5,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie.

68
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,790
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>早
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>Hey.

69
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,590
<2-7,BECKETT>怎么了
<2-7,BECKETT>What?

70
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,310
<2-8,CASTLE>呃...
<2-8,CASTLE>Uh...

71
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,940
<2-8,CASTLE>没事
<2-8,CASTLE>It's nothing.

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,020
<2-9,BECKETT>说  什么事
<2-9,BECKETT>No, what?

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,010
<2-10,CASTLE>只是她的...死相很平静
<2-10,CASTLE>Well, she just... looks so peaceful.

74
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,110
<2-11,LANIE>把她弃尸这里的可不是什么平静的人
<2-11,LANIE>There's nothing peaceful about what put her here.

75
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,790
<2-11,LANIE>-她是被勒死的  -用绳子吗
<2-11,LANIE>- She was strangled. - With rope?

76
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,440
<2-13,LANIE>看来是的
<2-13,LANIE>So it appears.

77
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,260
<2-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你对此有何高见
<2-14,BECKETT>Castle, do you have a theory

78
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,850
<2-14,BECKETT>介意说出来和大家分享一下么
<2-14,BECKETT>that you would like to share with the class?

79
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,490
<2-15,CASTLE>我...只是一个金发美女被勒死
<2-15,CASTLE>Well, I-I--it's just that, pretty blonde girl, strangled,

80
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,800
<2-15,CASTLE>尸体摆成睡觉的姿势
<2-15,CASTLE>laid out like she was asleep.

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,030
<2-16,BECKETT>都是四年前的事了
<2-16,BECKETT>That was four years ago.

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,880
<2-17,CASTLE>对  但他仍在逃  这是他的作案手法
<2-17,CASTLE>Yes, but he was never caught. This is his M.O.

83
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,190
<2-17,CASTLE>而且这女的绝对是他的菜
<2-17,CASTLE>And she is certainly his type.

84
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,230
<2-17,CASTLE>我写《屠杀来临》时调查过他
<2-17,CASTLE>I researched him for "When it comes to slaughter."

85
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,530
<2-18,BECKETT>是吗  那你该知道他只在
<2-18,BECKETT>Yeah? Well, then you should know that

86
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,810
<2-18,BECKETT>受害人的公寓行凶
<2-18,BECKETT>he killed his victims inside their apartments,

87
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,180
<2-18,BECKETT>而非横街窄巷
<2-18,BECKETT>not in alleyways.

88
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,200
<2-18,BECKETT>他还会将她们摆成
<2-18,BECKETT>And he posed them

89
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,070
<2-18,BECKETT>双手合拢放在胸前的殡葬姿势
<2-18,BECKETT>in a funeral pose with their hands clasped in front of them.

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,190
<2-19,CASTLE>也许他改变手法了
<2-19,CASTLE>Maybe he's switching up his act.

91
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,040
<2-20,BECKETT>或者极有可能只是一件单纯的
<2-20,BECKETT>Or this just could be a crime of opportunity

92
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,080
<2-20,BECKETT>年轻女士被杀案
<2-20,BECKETT>where a young woman was murdered.

93
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,350
<3-1,BECKETT>罗素女士  你女儿有跟你提过
<3-1,BECKETT>Mrs. Russo, did your daughter ever talk to you

94
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,010
<3-1,BECKETT>被跟踪吗
<3-1,BECKETT>about being followed?

95
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,190
<3-1,BECKETT>没有  也没有类似事件
<3-1,BECKETT>No. Nothing like that.

96
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,110
<3-2,BECKETT>你能想到有谁
<3-2,BECKETT>Can you think of anyone that

97
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,010
<3-2,BECKETT>会去伤害她吗
<3-2,BECKETT>might have wanted to harm her?

98
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,670
<3-2,BECKETT>有情感问题吗
<3-2,BECKETT>Any relationship problems?

99
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,010
<3-2,BECKETT>她连约会都没有
<3-2,BECKETT>She wasn't even dating.

100
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,840
<3-3,BECKETT>她大多数时间都在工作
<3-3,BECKETT>Pretty much all she did was work.

101
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,830
<3-3,BECKETT>-在电视公司工作对吗  -嗯
<3-3,BECKETT>- At the, uh, cable company, right? - Mm-hmm.

102
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,770
<3-3,BECKETT>她和同事之间有矛盾吗
<3-3,BECKETT>Did she have any issues with anyone there?

103
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,750
<3-3,BECKETT>呃...和办公室一个男职员
<3-3,BECKETT>Uh... There was a man at her office.

104
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,000
<3-4,BECKETT>-他叫什么名字  -她没说
<3-4,BECKETT>- What was his name? - She didn't say.

105
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,780
<3-4,BECKETT>但他老盯着她看  像个变态
<3-4,BECKETT>But he stared at her a lot, like some pervert.

106
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,510
<4-1,LANIE>-来得真快  -鸡毛信对她可有效了
<4-1,LANIE>- That was quick. - 9-1-1 has that affect on her.

107
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,610
<4-4,LANIE>-你有何发现  -按你的吩咐
<4-4,LANIE>- What'd you find? - I pulled all the files

108
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,710
<4-4,LANIE>我翻出了他的所有旧档案
<4-4,LANIE>on all his past murders, just like you asked.

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,860
<4-5,CASTLE>那可是我的想法
<4-5,CASTLE>I-I believe that was my idea.

110
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,210
<4-6,LANIE>对  但我只听她的命令
<4-6,LANIE>Yeah, but I only listen when it comes from her.

111
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,510
<4-7,BECKETT>随便啦  你继续说
<4-7,BECKETT>Anyway, you were saying?

112
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,900
<4-8,LANIE>他会用四分一英寸的
<4-8,LANIE>He choked them using a 3-strand,

113
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
<4-8,LANIE>3股绞绳勒死受害人
<4-8,LANIE>twisted quarter-inch rope.

114
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
<4-8,LANIE>根据嵌入皮肤的纤维
<4-8,LANIE>Based on the fibers found embedded in the skin,

115
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,460
<4-8,LANIE>我们知道绳子是绿白相间的尼龙绳
<4-8,LANIE>we know that the rope is green and white nylon.

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,560
<4-9,CASTLE>这点我可没印象
<4-9,CASTLE>I don't remember that.

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,160
<4-10,LANIE>那些细节从来没公开过
<4-10,LANIE>Those details were never made public.

118
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,430
<4-10,LANIE>来看看这个
<4-10,LANIE>Now check this out.

119
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,530
<4-11,CASTLE>勒痕完全一致
<4-11,CASTLE>The marks are identical.

120
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,620
<4-12,LANIE>这次也发现了一摸一样的绿白相间纤维
<4-12,LANIE>I found the exact same green and white fibers.

121
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,070
<4-13,BECKETT>是他干的
<4-13,BECKETT>It is him.

122
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,000
<4-13,BECKETT>三重杀手回来了
<4-13,BECKETT>The triple killer is back.

123
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,960
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>四年前你们还寂寂无名时
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>For those of you living in a cave four years ago,

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,940
<4-13,BECKETT>三重杀手  或称为3XK
<4-13,BECKETT>the triple killer, or 3XK,

125
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,390
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>曾因一周内勒死三位女性而得此绰号
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>got his nickname by strangling three women in a week,

126
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,840
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>随后他销声匿迹一个月
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>dropping out of sight for a month,

127
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,100
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>然后再出来杀多三个后  便无影无踪了
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>and then killing three more, then he disappeared.

128
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,050
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>我曾是调查这六宗
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>I served on the task force that

129
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,710
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>谋杀案的特遣队一员
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>investigated those six murders.

130
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,550
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>联调局给出了识别
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>An FBI profile was as close as

131
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>嫌疑人的最贴近的侧写
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>we came to I.D.'ing a suspect.

132
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,090
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>联邦政府的人说他是一位白人男性
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>The feds say he's a white male,

133
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,200
<5-2,CASTLE>-年龄在25至45岁之间  -说我呢
<5-2,CASTLE>- 25 to 45 years old... - Could be me.

134
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,960
<5-3,MONTGOMERY>和母亲关系不和
<5-3,MONTGOMERY>with a dysfunctional relationship with his mother.

135
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,840
<5-4,CASTLE>我也是哎
<5-4,CASTLE>Still me.

136
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,200
<5-5,MONTGOMERY>他有一份乏味琐碎的工作
<5-5,MONTGOMERY>He has a menial, unimportant job.

137
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,880
<5-6,BECKETT>就是你  没错了
<5-6,BECKETT>Definitely you.

138
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,520
<5-7,CASTLE>就冲你这句话  我下本书换埃斯波西托当主角
<5-7,CASTLE>Just for that, I base my next book on Esposito.

139
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,830
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>他会摸透她们的习惯
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>He'd learn their habits,

140
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>然后假扮成
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>and then gain access to their apartments

141
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>保安或维修工
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>by disguising himself

142
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,910
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>进入受害人的公寓
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>as a security guard or a repairman,

143
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,490
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>接着勒死她们
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>and then he strangled 'em.

144
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,830
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>最后将她们的尸体
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>Then he posed their bodies

145
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,230
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>摆成躺在棺材的样子
<5-8,MONTGOMERY>as if they were lying in a coffin.

146
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,700
<5-9,BECKETT>你说他干这些是为何呢
<5-9,BECKETT>What do you think that's all about?

147
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,660
<5-10,CASTLE>可能是在重演某种可怕的早期创伤
<5-10,CASTLE>Probably reenacting some terrible early trauma.

148
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,810
<5-11,BECKETT>最后二个要点
<5-11,BECKETT>Two final points--

149
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,960
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>看来三重杀手四年后重出江湖了
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>the triple killer seems to be back after four years.

150
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,640
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>必定事出有因
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>There must be a reason.

151
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,740
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>也许他刚出狱或重回此地
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>Maybe he just got out of prison or returned to town.

152
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,280
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>他可能改变了作案手法
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>He may have altered his M.O.

153
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,590
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>但我们先假定他的作案规律没变
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>But let's assume that he's working under the same clock--

154
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,210
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>依然是一周三场谋杀
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>three murders, one week.

155
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,220
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>根据琳达·罗素的死亡时间
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>Based on Linda Russo's time of death,

156
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,020
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>今天已经是第三天了
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>we're already into day three.

157
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,680
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>大伙  快点行动起来
<5-12,MONTGOMERY>Let's move on this, people.

158
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,410
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>关于死者母亲提过的那个变态
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>Hey. That perv the mom told us about?

159
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,960
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>琳达的同事马上就想到是谁了
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>Linda's colleagues knew who he was right away.

160
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,790
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>保罗·麦卡德
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>Paul Mccardle.

161
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,040
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>他是死者办公室的园艺工
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>He works at her office as a horticultural technician.

162
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,850
<5-14,BECKETT>什么工
<5-14,BECKETT>A what?

163
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,670
<5-15,RYAN>也就是  专给植物浇浇水
<5-15,RYAN>Uh, you know, he's the guy who waters the plants,

164
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,000
<5-15,RYAN>给假树擦擦尘的人
<5-15,RYAN>dusts the fake ficus,

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,590
<5-15,RYAN>至少在昨天辞职前他还是干这些
<5-15,RYAN>or at least he was until he quit yesterday.

166
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,030
<5-16,BECKETT>时间拿捏得真准啊
<5-16,BECKETT>That's interesting timing.

167
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,550
<5-16,BECKETT>他累积了两位数的家庭投诉
<5-16,BECKETT>I see domestic complaints by the double digits.

168
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,530
<5-17,CASTLE>投诉人是他妻子
<5-17,CASTLE>Filed by his wife.

169
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,480
<5-18,RYAN>是前妻  他们结婚四年
<5-18,RYAN>Ex-wife. They were divorced last month

170
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,970
<5-18,RYAN>上个月离婚了
<5-18,RYAN>after being married for four years.

171
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,390
<5-19,CASTLE>这么说来  在某种程度上他的确被释放了
<5-19,CASTLE>So in a way, he did just get out of prison.

172
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,390
<5-20,RYAN>不仅如此
<5-20,RYAN>It gets even better.

173
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,800
<5-20,RYAN>琳达的邻居回忆说几天前
<5-20,RYAN>Linda's neighbors said they remember seeing

174
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,580
<5-20,RYAN>曾有辆红色的森特拉汽车停在她公寓楼下
<5-20,RYAN>a red Sentra parked outside her apartment a few days ago--

175
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,270
<5-21,BECKETT>-跟麦卡德的一样  -带他过来
<5-21,BECKETT>- The same vehicle Mccardle has.  - Let's get him in here.

176
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,790
<6-1,MCCARDLE>-找我来有啥事  -关于琳达·罗素
<6-1,MCCARDLE>- So what's this about?  - Linda Russo.

177
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
<6-2,BECKETT>两天前  下午六点至午夜时分你在哪里
<6-2,BECKETT>Where were you 2 nights ago between 6:00 and midnight?

178
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,020
<6-3,MCCARDLE>我在星道球馆跟几个朋友打保龄球
<6-3,MCCARDLE>Um, I was bowling with some buddies at, uh, galaxy lanes.

179
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,410
<6-4,CASTLE>你为什么要
<6-4,CASTLE>So why did you decide to

180
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,300
<6-4,CASTLE>放弃园丁的工作
<6-4,CASTLE>abandon your career as a horticultural technician?

181
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,630
<6-5,MCCARDLE>我只是想过新的生活
<6-5,MCCARDLE>I-I just wanted to move on.

182
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,350
<6-6,BECKETT>是因为你借用那份工作来监视和跟踪琳达
<6-6,BECKETT>Because you used that job to watch linda, to stalk her.

183
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,290
<6-6,BECKETT>一旦她死了  就没理由逗留了吧
<6-6,BECKETT>And once she was dead, why stick around?

184
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,190
<6-7,MCCARDLE>不是的  我是无辜的
<6-7,MCCARDLE>That is not true. I'm innocent here.

185
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,860
<6-8,BECKETT>你看起来可不无辜
<6-8,BECKETT>Well, you don't look innocent.

186
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,030
<6-9,CASTLE>话说回来  你还真是个
<6-9,CASTLE>No, as a matter of fact, you give new meaning

187
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,930
<6-9,CASTLE>被"逼问得直冒冷汗"的嫌疑人啊
<6-9,CASTLE>to the phrase "Sweating a suspect."

188
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,210
<6-10,MCCARDLE>没错  我很爱流汗  不行么
<6-10,MCCARDLE>Okay, yeah, I perspire a lot, okay?

189
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,010
<6-10,MCCARDLE>我身体不好
<6-10,MCCARDLE>I have a medical condition.

190
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,770
<6-11,BECKETT>那都是小问题  你现在麻烦大着呢
<6-11,BECKETT>Well, that's the least of your problems, Mr. Mccardle.

191
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,160
<6-11,BECKETT>你跟踪琳达·罗素是众所周知的事
<6-11,BECKETT>Your fixation with Linda Russo was well known,

192
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,500
<6-11,BECKETT>而且你有对妇女施暴的案底
<6-11,BECKETT>as was your history of violence against women.

193
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,040
<6-11,BECKETT>有人看见你的车停在她公寓楼下
<6-11,BECKETT>Your car was seen outside of her apartment,

194
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,350
<6-11,BECKETT>现在她死了
<6-11,BECKETT>and now she's dead.

195
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,160
<6-12,MCCARDLE>我从没碰过她
<6-12,MCCARDLE>I never touched her.

196
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,920
<6-12,MCCARDLE>我对琳达很着迷  我对她很着迷
<6-12,MCCARDLE>I had a thing for linda, okay. I had a thing for linda,

197
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,950
<6-12,MCCARDLE>我的确把车停在她家楼下了
<6-12,MCCARDLE>and I parked out in front of her place.

198
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,150
<6-12,MCCARDLE>可三天来我从没
<6-12,MCCARDLE>But I haven't been anywhere near there

199
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,820
<6-12,MCCARDLE>靠近过那里  明白吗
<6-12,MCCARDLE>in three days, okay?

200
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,340
<6-12,MCCARDLE>-因为有人威胁过我  -什么人
<6-12,MCCARDLE>- Not since that guy threatened me.  - What guy?

201
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,580
<6-14,MCCARDLE>我被一个保安赶了出来
<6-14,MCCARDLE>I-I got--I got rousted by some security guy,

202
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,380
<6-14,MCCARDLE>他让我别再纠缠她了
<6-14,MCCARDLE>and--and he told me to move on.

203
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,520
<6-14,MCCARDLE>我真的被吓到了
<6-14,MCCARDLE>And it really freaked me out,

204
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,000
<6-14,MCCARDLE>从那之后我就没去过那里了
<6-14,MCCARDLE>and I haven't been back there since.

205
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,530
<6-14,MCCARDLE>真的  我发誓
<6-14,MCCARDLE>I swear. That's the truth.

206
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,270
<7-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>"瀑布汗先生"  他的不在场证明成立
<7-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>So sweaty von sweats-a-lot? His alibi is holding.

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,820
<7-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>星道球馆的经理证实他在那打保龄球
<7-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>The manager of galaxy lanes has him throwing gutter balls

208
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,850
<7-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>从五点直到打烊
<7-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>5:00 until close.

209
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,150
<7-2,BECKETT>那保安有什么线索
<7-2,BECKETT>What about the security guard?

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,010
<7-3,ESPOSITO>莱恩去查了下  结果发现
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Ryan checked into that. Turns out that there's

211
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,430
<7-3,ESPOSITO>琳达所处的街区只有一栋楼聘用了保安
<7-3,ESPOSITO>only one building on Linda's block that uses guards.

212
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,800
<7-3,ESPOSITO>根据保安公司的记录
<7-3,ESPOSITO>According to the security company,

213
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,510
<7-3,ESPOSITO>没有与麦卡德及其车辆
<7-3,ESPOSITO>no incident report was ever filed

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,280
<7-3,ESPOSITO>有关的事故报告
<7-3,ESPOSITO>against Mccardle or his vehicle.

215
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,080
<7-4,CASTLE>所以他在说谎
<7-4,CASTLE>So Mccardle was lying.

216
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,060
<7-5,BECKETT>不一定  话说以前
<7-5,BECKETT>Maybe not. You know, in the past,

217
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,070
<7-5,BECKETT>三重杀手曾伪装过保安
<7-5,BECKETT>the triple killer posed as a security guard.

218
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,320
<7-5,BECKETT>也许那人根本就不是保安
<7-5,BECKETT>Maybe our guard wasn't a guard after all.

219
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,240
<7-5,BECKETT>也许是杀手赶走了麦卡德
<7-5,BECKETT>Maybe it was the triple killer moving

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,830
<7-5,BECKETT>以便行凶
<7-5,BECKETT>Mccardle off of his turf.

221
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,190
<7-6,MONTGOMERY>不管是谁  他都在按计划行事
<7-6,MONTGOMERY>Well, whoever he is, he's sticking to his schedule.

222
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,330
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>有第二个人遇害了
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>We have a second victim.

225
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,690
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>翻译：小池 苏小黛 大卫熊 小易 千花 小蛮腰
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>时间轴：零    后期：瓜瓜   校对&总监：安小七

227
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,530
<8-1,LANIE>她叫金·福斯特  28岁  室内设计师
<8-1,LANIE>Her name's Kim Foster-- 28, an interior designer.

228
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,450
<8-1,LANIE>颈部有同样的勒痕  一切都跟上个案子一样
<8-1,LANIE>Same rope marks on her neck, same everything.

229
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,980
<8-2,BECKETT>-死亡时间是多久  -根据肝温推测
<8-2,BECKETT>- When did she die?  - Uh, based on liver temp,

230
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,770
<8-3,LANIE>大致是在昨晚  可能傍晚时分
<8-3,LANIE>I'd say sometime last night, probably early evening.

231
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,140
<8-4,ESPOSITO>邻居看到有个瓦斯工人于7:45左右离开
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Neighbors saw a gas repairman leave at 7:45.

232
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,720
<8-5,CASTLE>大楼没有看门人
<8-5,CASTLE>No doorman on the building,

233
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,490
<8-5,CASTLE>所以三重杀手是在对讲机上呼叫了她
<8-5,CASTLE>so triple killer calls kim foster on the intercom,

234
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,510
<8-5,CASTLE>说他要去检查下瓦斯泄漏问题
<8-5,CASTLE>says he wants to check a gas leak,

235
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,460
<8-5,CASTLE>她就让他进来了
<8-5,CASTLE>she buzzes him in.

236
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,360
<8-6,ESPOSITO>我查查来电者身份
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Let me check the incoming caller I.D.S. Ah.

237
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,030
<8-7,BECKETT>我不明白  他干嘛要用跟过去一样的手段
<8-7,BECKETT>I don't get it. Why did he return to the old M.O.?

238
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,550
<8-8,CASTLE>-他怀旧呗  -可他杀琳达·罗素是在条小巷里
<8-8,CASTLE>- Nostalgia.  - He killed Linda Russo in an alley.

239
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,060
<8-9,BECKETT>她的公寓也没有看门人  为何不在公寓动手
<8-9,BECKETT>She didn't have a doorman either. Why didn't he

240
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,260
<8-9,BECKETT>就像杀死其他被害者一样
<8-9,BECKETT>just kill her in her apartment like all the others?

241
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,260
<8-10,CASTLE>也许她有特别之处
<8-10,CASTLE>Well, maybe she was special somehow.

242
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,460
<8-11,BECKETT>死者的最后一通电话是7:35从前门打来的
<8-11,BECKETT>Vic's last incoming call was at 7:35 from the front door.

243
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,720
<8-11,BECKETT>一定是她让他进来了  然后
<8-11,BECKETT>She must have been let him in, and boom,

244
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,920
<8-11,BECKETT>他制服了她
<8-11,BECKETT>He just overpowered her.

245
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,120
<8-12,CASTLE>也许没那么简单  看看那些抱枕
<8-12,CASTLE>Maybe it wasn't that easy. Look at those throw pillows.

246
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,680
<8-13,ESPOSITO>抱枕怎么了
<8-13,ESPOSITO>What's wrong with 'em?

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,370
<8-14,CASTLE>她是室内设计师
<8-14,CASTLE>Well, Kim Foster's an interior designer.

248
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,560
<8-14,CASTLE>可这些抱枕被摆放地
<8-14,CASTLE>These pillows have been arranged

249
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,480
<8-14,CASTLE>非常随意  非常不美观
<8-14,CASTLE>with a barbarian-like gracelessness.

250
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,870
<8-15,BECKETT>像是粗鲁的男人所为  所以她反抗过
<8-15,BECKETT>Like a man would do it. So she put up a fight.

251
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,060
<8-16,CASTLE>他们在沙发上搏斗过
<8-16,CASTLE>They struggled right here on the couch.

252
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,790
<8-17,BECKETT>然后他重新摆放了这些抱枕试图掩盖
<8-17,BECKETT>And then he reset the pillows to cover it up.

253
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,090
<8-18,CASTLE>他可没经过专业训练  所以摆放得很不整齐
<8-18,CASTLE>He's out of practice, so he's not so neat.

254
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,570
<8-20,BECKETT>-哦耶  -什么
<8-20,BECKETT>- Hup!  - What?

255
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,260
<8-21,CASTLE>找到个硬币
<8-21,CASTLE>Found a penny.

256
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,910
<8-22,CASTLE>在命案现场捡到钱  还算走运么
<8-22,CASTLE>Under the circumstances, is this still lucky?

257
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,900
<8-23,BECKETT>等等  我也找到点东西
<8-23,BECKETT>Wait. I think I found something, too.

258
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,590
<8-24,CASTLE>"文斯"  你觉得是凶手的吗
<8-24,CASTLE>Vince. You think it belonged to the killer?

259
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,850
<8-25,BECKETT>也可能落在这好几周了
<8-25,BECKETT>Or maybe it's been here for weeks.

260
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,370
<8-25,BECKETT>我交给鉴证小组查一下
<8-25,BECKETT>I'm gonna have to get C.S.U. to process this area.

261
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,970
<9-1,RYAN>头儿  有位唐森先生想见您
<9-1,RYAN>Sir... A Mr. Townsend wants a word.

262
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,770
<9-2,MONTGOMERY>带他进来
<9-2,MONTGOMERY>Bring him in.

263
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,460
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>卡尔
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>Cal.

264
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,200
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>好久不见啊
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>Good to see you.

265
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,130
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>玛丽还好吗
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>How's Marie?

266
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,080
<9-4,CAL TOWNSEND>还行吧
<9-4,CAL TOWNSEND>Uh... She's okay.

267
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,230
<9-4,CAL TOWNSEND>我们分居了
<9-4,CAL TOWNSEND>We're split up now.

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,360
<9-5,MONTGOMERY>我很遗憾
<9-5,MONTGOMERY>I'm sorry to hear that.

269
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,240
<9-6,TOWNSEND>那些记者
<9-6,TOWNSEND>Reporters...

270
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,800
<9-6,TOWNSEND>他们一直跑到我家来
<9-6,TOWNSEND>They keep coming to my door

271
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,070
<9-6,TOWNSEND>问我对那个杀了我女儿的人
<9-6,TOWNSEND>and asking me how I feel about...

272
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,970
<9-6,TOWNSEND>做何感想
<9-6,TOWNSEND>The man who killed my daughter,

273
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,720
<9-6,TOWNSEND>还说他可能又逍遥法外了
<9-6,TOWNSEND>and he might be on the loose again,

274
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,520
<9-6,TOWNSEND>萨拉死后  在调查过程中
<9-6,TOWNSEND>after Sara died and all through the investigation,

275
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,450
<9-6,TOWNSEND>你一直对我直言不讳
<9-6,TOWNSEND>you were always straight with me,

276
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,090
<9-6,TOWNSEND>我现在只想知道
<9-6,TOWNSEND>and I just need to know, you know...

277
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,700
<9-6,TOWNSEND>他们说的  是真的吗
<9-6,TOWNSEND>I mean, what they're saying, is it true?

278
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,250
<9-6,TOWNSEND>我是说  他又回来了吗
<9-6,TOWNSEND>I mean... Is he back?

279
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,880
<9-6,TOWNSEND>是的
<9-6,TOWNSEND>Yes.

280
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,460
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>卡尔  我们有线索了  很有用的线索
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>Cal, we got leads. We got good leads.

281
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,270
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>我们会尽全力将他缉拿归案
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>And we--we're doing all we can to chase 'em down.

282
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,060
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>只要我们捉住它  一定首先通知你
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>If we make an arrest, you'll be the first to know.

283
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,380
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>我保证
<9-7,MONTGOMERY>I promise you.

284
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,900
<9-8,TOWNSEND>萨拉还活着的话  下周就29岁了
<9-8,TOWNSEND>Sara would've been 29 next week.

285
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,090
<9-8,TOWNSEND>别让他毁掉另一个家庭
<9-8,TOWNSEND>Don't let him do this to another family.

286
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,490
<10-2,BECKETT>那个名牌  鉴证小组那边没线索
<10-2,BECKETT>Hey. There's no news from C.S.U.

287
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,970
<10-2,BECKETT>我也没指望能有什么发现
<10-2,BECKETT>on the nametag, not that I was expecting any.

288
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,910
<10-3,CASTLE>很令人起疑啊  他为什么
<10-3,CASTLE>It makes you wonder why he didn't pull

289
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,260
<10-3,CASTLE>不用假扮瓦斯工那套手法对付琳达·罗素
<10-3,CASTLE>that whole gas leak routine on Linda Russo.

290
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,270
<10-4,BECKETT>我知道为什么  答案在这里
<10-4,BECKETT>I know why. The answer's in here.

291
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,090
<10-5,CASTLE>-笔录  -四年前的
<10-5,CASTLE>- A transcript?  - From four years ago.

292
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,640
<10-6,BECKETT>我查看了当年提供三重杀手线索的热线记录
<10-6,BECKETT>I took a look at calls made to the triple killer tip line,

293
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,750
<10-6,BECKETT>这条引起了我的注意
<10-6,BECKETT>and this one stood out for me.

294
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,560
<10-6,BECKETT>时间是2006年5月21日
<10-6,BECKETT>It's from may 21, 2006,

295
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,570
<10-6,BECKETT>是第六起命案后的一周
<10-6,BECKETT>which was a week after the sixth murder.

296
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,370
<10-6,BECKETT>一个女人打来电话并留了言
<10-6,BECKETT>A woman called and left a message,

297
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,730
<10-6,BECKETT>但她没敢留下姓名
<10-6,BECKETT>but she was too afraid to leave her name.

298
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,050
<10-6,BECKETT>可她提到自己住在第10和第24街区之间
<10-6,BECKETT>But she did mention that she lived at 24th and 10th.

299
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,190
<10-7,CASTLE>跟琳达·罗素一样
<10-7,CASTLE>Same corner as Linda Russo.

300
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,260
<10-8,BECKETT>她当时跟一个有线电视修理工同乘电梯
<10-8,BECKETT>She was riding an elevator with a cable repairman

301
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,400
<10-8,BECKETT>他把她吓坏了
<10-8,BECKETT>who so creeped her out

302
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,480
<10-8,BECKETT>为了早点摆脱他
<10-8,BECKETT>that she got off a floor early

303
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,800
<10-8,BECKETT>她甚至提前一层下了电梯
<10-8,BECKETT>just to get away from him.

304
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,300
<10-9,CASTLE>可是  修有线电视的都很吓人啊
<10-9,CASTLE>Yeah, but cable guy are creepy--

305
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,820
<10-9,CASTLE>那是工作需要
<10-9,CASTLE>that's a job requirement.

306
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,080
<10-10,BECKETT>可他不是修有线电视的
<10-10,BECKETT>Except he wasn't a cable guy.

307
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,600
<10-10,BECKETT>她说他带的工具箱不对
<10-10,BECKETT>She said he wasn't carrying the right tools.

308
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,140
<10-11,CASTLE>琳达·罗素是在有线电台工作的
<10-11,CASTLE>And working for a cable company,

309
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,810
<10-11,CASTLE>她肯定知道这点
<10-11,CASTLE>Linda Russo would know that.

310
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,320
<10-12,BECKETT>所以我查看了
<10-12,BECKETT>Which is why I took a look

311
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,560
<10-12,BECKETT>琳达·罗素四年前的电话记录
<10-12,BECKETT>at Linda Russo's phone records from four years ago.

312
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,680
<10-12,BECKETT>那通热线电话就是她打的
<10-12,BECKETT>She's the one who made the call to that tip line.

313
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,350
<10-13,CASTLE>所以她跟其他被害者不同
<10-13,CASTLE>So Linda Russo was special.

314
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,660
<10-14,BECKETT>她提前下了电梯
<10-14,BECKETT>When she got off a floor early,

315
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:54,960
<10-14,BECKETT>他知道她有所警觉了
<10-14,BECKETT>he knew that she made him,

316
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,550
<10-14,BECKETT>所以他放弃计划逃之夭夭了
<10-14,BECKETT>So he dropped out of sight.

317
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,900
<10-15,CASTLE>这也解释了他为什么要在户外杀她
<10-15,CASTLE>Which also explains why he attacked her outside.

318
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,920
<10-15,CASTLE>他知道她不会
<10-15,CASTLE>He knew there was no way she'd

319
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
<10-15,CASTLE>让自己进她的家门
<10-15,CASTLE>let him into her apartment.

320
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,930
<10-16,BECKETT>当年琳达·罗素看到了他的脸
<10-16,BECKETT>Linda Russo saw his face,

321
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,200
<10-16,BECKETT>四年后他还是来杀了她
<10-16,BECKETT>and he came back four years later.

322
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,600
<10-16,BECKETT>真是种另类的残忍
<10-16,BECKETT>That's a special kind of ruthlessness.

323
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,430
<10-17,ESPOSITO>鉴证小组在名牌上找到了一个指纹
<10-17,ESPOSITO>Yo. C.S.U. Just got a partial on that nametag.

324
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,250
<10-17,ESPOSITO>发现吻合的了
<10-17,ESPOSITO>We got a match.

325
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,370
<10-17,ESPOSITO>我们要找的人叫马库斯·盖茨
<10-17,ESPOSITO>The man we're looking for is Marcus Gates--

326
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,310
<11-1,BECKETT>42岁  身高6英尺
<11-1,BECKETT>42, 6-foot tall,

327
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,320
<11-1,BECKETT>体重180磅  浅棕色头发
<11-1,BECKETT>180 pounds, with light brown hair.

328
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,470
<11-1,BECKETT>还有个蛇形纹身从左臂环绕而下
<11-1,BECKETT>He also has a snake tattoo running down his left arm.

329
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,810
<11-1,BECKETT>指纹与金·福斯特被害现场找到的指纹一致
<11-1,BECKETT>A print match ties him to Kim Foster's murder.

330
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,930
<11-1,BECKETT>有一份监狱的心理评估报告称盖茨是
<11-1,BECKETT>Now a prison psych evaluation calls Gates "A brutal,

331
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,480
<11-1,BECKETT>"野蛮的高智商反社会人士"
<11-1,BECKETT>Highly intelligent sociopath."

332
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,330
<11-1,BECKETT>他曾因过失杀人和杀人未遂入狱
<11-1,BECKETT>He's done time for manslaughter and attempted murder.

333
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,120
<11-1,BECKETT>他最近一次被定罪  是因为在酒吧
<11-1,BECKETT>His last conviction was for breaking a bottle

334
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,260
<11-1,BECKETT>用酒瓶砸了一个人的脑袋  差点把人砸死
<11-1,BECKETT>Over a man's head in a bar, almost killing him,

335
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,850
<11-1,BECKETT>他被判在新新监狱坐了四年牢
<11-1,BECKETT>for which Gates served four years in sing sing.

336
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,570
<11-1,BECKETT>上个月刚放出来
<11-1,BECKETT>He just got out last month.

337
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,830
<11-1,BECKETT>没有明确地址  没有家人
<11-1,BECKETT>No known address, no family.

338
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,060
<11-1,BECKETT>他四岁的时候母亲就去世了
<11-1,BECKETT>His mother died when he was 4 years old,

339
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,490
<11-1,BECKETT>那之后他先后在多个寄养家庭暂住
<11-1,BECKETT>and he was placed in a series of foster homes since then,

340
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,640
<11-1,BECKETT>所以说找到他不会很容易
<11-1,BECKETT>so he will not be easy to find.

341
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,500
<11-1,BECKETT>各位  四年前
<11-1,BECKETT>Listen, four years ago,

342
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,370
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>由于我们没能阻止他
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>this guy took the lives of six women

343
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,670
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>这个家伙杀了六个女人
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>because we didn't stop him.

344
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,970
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>我们现在知道"三重杀手"是谁
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>We know who the triple killer is.

345
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,980
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>我们知道他在寻找第三个目标
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>We know he's out there targeting his third victim.

346
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,110
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>在他找到她之前
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>Let's get him

347
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,650
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>抓住他
<11-2,MONTGOMERY>before he gets her.

348
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:22,820
<12-2,CASTLE>嘿  老爸
<12-2,CASTLE>Hey, dad.

349
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,330
<12-3,ALEXIS>-回来了  -大案子吗  这么晚才回来
<12-3,ALEXIS>- Hey. - Must be quite a case if it's keeping you out this late.

350
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,770
<12-4,CASTLE>无非就是  有人杀人  有人被杀
<12-4,CASTLE>Oh, you know, someone died, someone else did it.

351
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,630
<12-4,CASTLE>秘密仰慕者吗
<12-4,CASTLE>Secret admirer?

352
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,880
<12-5,ALEXIS>是啊
<12-5,ALEXIS>As a matter of fact, it is.

353
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,030
<12-6,CASTLE>知道是谁了吗
<12-6,CASTLE>You figure out who it was yet?

354
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,200
<12-7,ALEXIS>我听取了你的意见  决定还是不知道为妙
<12-7,ALEXIS>I took your advice and decided it's better not knowing.

355
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,990
<12-7,ALEXIS>他又在我的柜子里留了纸条
<12-7,ALEXIS>And he left another note in my locker.

356
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,870
<12-7,ALEXIS>他说如果我喜欢那支玫瑰  我就明天
<12-7,ALEXIS>He said if I like the rose, I should show him

357
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,550
<12-7,ALEXIS>上学时戴上它  表明心意
<12-7,ALEXIS>by wearing it at school tomorrow.

358
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,500
<12-7,ALEXIS>很浪漫吧
<12-7,ALEXIS>Isn't that sweet?

359
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,310
<12-8,CASTLE>你觉得...这是个好主意吗
<12-8,CASTLE>Well... Is that a good idea?

360
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,100
<12-8,CASTLE>你男朋友艾什利会怎么想
<12-8,CASTLE>W-what would your boyfriend Ashley think?

361
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,390
<12-9,ALEXIS>我怎么感觉是你对此有意见
<12-9,ALEXIS>I get a feeling it's not Ashley who has the problem.

362
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,730
<12-10,CASTLE>我只是认为在你不知道对方是谁的情况下
<12-10,CASTLE>I'm just not sure it's smart to go wearing some flower

363
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
<12-10,CASTLE>戴着花出现不是个好主意
<12-10,CASTLE>when you don't know who it's from.

364
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,700
<12-10,CASTLE>你们学校又不是诺克斯堡[美国政府黄金库]
<12-10,CASTLE>Your--your school is not exactly Fort Knox, all right?

365
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,730
<12-10,CASTLE>谁都有可能在你的柜子里留纸条
<12-10,CASTLE>Anyone could've put that note in your locker.

366
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,750
<12-10,CASTLE>你的秘密仰慕者有可能是...变态一个
<12-10,CASTLE>Your secret admirer could be some... pervert

367
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,110
<12-10,CASTLE>拿着高倍双筒望远镜在远处看着你
<12-10,CASTLE>watching you from afar with high-powered binoculars.

368
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,330
<12-11,ALEXIS>我要去睡觉了
<12-11,ALEXIS>I'm going to bed now.

369
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,900
<12-11,ALEXIS>晚安

<12-14,CASTLE>我要确认窗户一定要锁好
<12-14,CASTLE>I'm gonna check and make sure they're locked.

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,870
<13-1,RYAN>-都弄好了  在这堆文件里  -我没
<13-1,RYAN>- No, I had it all set up. It was in this pile. - I don't

375
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
<13-2,ESPOSITO>我可没搞懂你的摆放方式
<13-2,ESPOSITO>I don't understand your system.

376
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,790
<13-3,RYAN>是你弄乱的
<13-3,RYAN>You're messing up my system.

377
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,710
<13-4,CASTLE>伙计们  有盖茨线索吗
<13-4,CASTLE>Hey, guys. Any news on Gates?

378
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,470
<13-5,RYAN>我的摆放很有效率
<13-5,RYAN>My system is efficient.

379
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,170
<13-6,ESPOSITO>但是很蠢
<13-6,ESPOSITO>And dumb.

380
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,080
<13-7,RYAN>这个我都看过了  在你那堆文件里
<13-7,RYAN>I already went through this one. It's on your stack.

381
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,170
<13-10,ESPOSITO>-那是我的一种摆放方式  -那太蠢了
<13-10,ESPOSITO>- It's part of my system. - Your system is dumb.

382
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,490
<13-11,CASTLE>没有线索吗
<13-11,CASTLE>So... Nothing?

383
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,120
<13-12,BECKETT>是啊  找到了他住在泽西的叔叔
<13-12,BECKETT>No. We tracked down an uncle in Jersey,

384
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,670
<13-12,BECKETT>但是他有20年没见过盖茨了
<13-12,BECKETT>but he hasn't seen Gates in 20 years.

385
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,940
<13-12,BECKETT>我在和新新监狱的人通话
<13-12,BECKETT>So I'm on the phone with sing sing

386
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,350
<13-12,BECKETT>追查他在监狱的伙伴
<13-12,BECKETT>to chase down prison associates.

387
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,700
<13-13,PRISON OFFICER>贝克特探长  你还在吗
<13-13,PRISON OFFICER>Detective Beckett, you still there?

388
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,490
<13-14,BECKETT>是的  我还在
<13-14,BECKETT>Yes, I'm still here.

389
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,040
<13-14,BECKETT>好的  他还在监狱吗
<13-14,BECKETT>Okay. And is he still doing time?

390
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,210
<13-14,BECKETT>因吸毒首次入狱  知道了  谢谢
<13-14,BECKETT>First-time drug offender. Got it. Thanks.

391
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,850
<13-15,CASTLE>杰端·泰森
<13-15,CASTLE>"Jelly Tyson"?

392
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,370
<13-16,BECKETT>是"杰瑞"  卡塞尔
<13-16,BECKETT>It's "Jerry," Castle.

393
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,820
<13-16,BECKETT>盖茨被释放之后
<13-16,BECKETT>When Gates got released,

394
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,840
<13-16,BECKETT>他把所有东西都给了一个狱友杰瑞·泰森
<13-16,BECKETT>he gave all of us stuff to Jerry Tyson, a fellow inmate.

395
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,010
<13-16,BECKETT>如果他们两个是朋友
<13-16,BECKETT>So if the two of them were friends,

396
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,340
<13-16,BECKETT>杰瑞有可能知道在哪里能找到盖茨
<13-16,BECKETT>Jerry might be able to tell us where we can find Gates.

397
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,520
<13-17,CASTLE>现在才是"杰瑞"
<13-17,CASTLE>Now it's "Jerry."

398
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,210
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>我还有三个月就能离开这鬼地方
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>I got three months left in this hellhole.

399
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,130
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>我要做的就是好好表现
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>All I want to do is do my time,

400
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,380
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>出狱  去看我的女友
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>get out, and go see my girl,

401
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,350
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>但是如果盖茨知道我跟警察谈了话
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>and it's never gonna happen if Gates gets wind

402
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,160
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>以上的那些都会变成一场空
<14-1,JERRY TYSON>that I talked to cops.

403
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,880
<14-2,BECKETT>他不会知道
<14-2,BECKETT>He won't.

404
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,070
<14-2,BECKETT>你怎么保证
<14-2,BECKETT>You don't know that.

405
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,390
<14-3,JERRY>他在这里有耳目
<14-3,JERRY>He's got reach in here.

406
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,340
<14-3,JERRY>他会弄死我的
<14-3,JERRY>He'll have me taken out.

407
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,810
<14-4,BECKETT>情况是这样  杰瑞  不管你说不说
<14-4,BECKETT>Here's the deal, Jerry-- whether you talk to us or not,

408
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,090
<14-4,BECKETT>我都会在这陪你等上一天
<14-4,BECKETT>I am willing to sit here all day.

409
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,190
<14-4,BECKETT>这样的话
<14-4,BECKETT>So it's gonna look like...

410
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,710
<14-4,BECKETT>别人还是会以为你给我们透露了消息
<14-4,BECKETT>you were spilling your guts to us.

411
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,920
<14-5,JERRY>好吧  但是你们要保证两分钟后让我回牢房
<14-5,JERRY>All right. But I want to be back in my cell in two minutes.

412
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,350
<14-6,BECKETT>可以  你们是朋友吗
<14-6,BECKETT>Fair enough. Were the two of you friends?

413
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,910
<14-7,JERRY>也许吧  如果狱友算是朋友的话
<14-7,JERRY>I guess. Whatever that means in here.

414
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,320
<14-7,JERRY>我在厨房干活
<14-7,JERRY>I work in the kitchen.

415
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,070
<14-7,JERRY>我帮他偷水果  他用来酿酒
<14-7,JERRY>I snuck him fruit so he could make pruno.

416
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,860
<14-8,BECKETT>作为回报  他同意保护你是吧
<14-8,BECKETT>And in return, he agreed to protect you?

417
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,960
<14-9,JERRY>是  现在他出狱了  我一个人在这耗着
<14-9,JERRY>Yeah. Now he's gone, and I'm in here, going it alone.

418
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,010
<14-10,BECKETT>每个骗子都憧憬着当他出狱后
<14-10,BECKETT>Every con I've ever known dreams of what he'll do

419
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,690
<14-10,BECKETT>会干些什么  去什么地方
<14-10,BECKETT>and where he'll go once he gets out.

420
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,170
<14-10,BECKETT>盖茨和你提起过吗
<14-10,BECKETT>Gates ever talk to you about that?

421
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,700
<14-11,JERRY>我记得他提起过一些脱衣舞俱乐部
<14-11,JERRY>I remember him talking about some strip clubs, and, um,

422
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,760
<14-11,JERRY>还提过一个他经常去喝酒的地方
<14-11,JERRY>there's a place he liked to go drinking. Um...

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,770

<14-13,JERRY>名字跟野猪有关
<14-13,JERRY>Something about hogs.

<15-1,ESPOSITO>我刚刚侦查过了  他在酒吧喝啤酒
<15-1,ESPOSITO>I just did some recon. He's at the bar nursing a beer.

<16-3,MONTGOMERY>Pin him down on where he was when she died.

463
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,690
<16-3,MONTGOMERY>卡塞尔
<16-3,MONTGOMERY>Castle...

464
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,820
<16-4,MONTGOMERY>这次旁观
<16-4,MONTGOMERY>Not this time.

465
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,020
<17-1,BECKETT>盖茨先生  我是贝克特探长
<17-1,BECKETT>Mr. Gates, I'm Detective Beckett.

466
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,670
<17-2,GATES>不是我喜欢的类型
<17-2,GATES>Not my type.

467
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,330
<17-2,GATES>但是呢
<17-2,GATES>But...

468
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,180
<17-2,GATES>我可以为你破一次例
<17-2,GATES>I would make an exception.

469
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,080
<17-3,BECKETT>你认识金·福斯特吗
<17-3,BECKETT>Do you know Kim Foster?

470
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,820
<17-4,GATES>应该不认识
<17-4,GATES>Doesn't ring a bell.

471
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,170
<17-5,BECKETT>你见过这个女人吗
<17-5,BECKETT>Have you ever seen this woman before?

472
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,340
<17-6,GATES>头发挺漂亮
<17-6,GATES>She has nice hair.

473
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,260
<17-7,BECKETT>你到底见没见过她
<17-7,BECKETT>Have you or haven't you seen her?

474
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,170
<17-8,GATES>纽约市啊
<17-8,GATES>Uh, New York city

475
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,520
<17-8,GATES>这么大个地方
<17-8,GATES>is a big place.

476
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,310
<17-8,GATES>我是说  我们可能在街上擦肩而过吧
<17-8,GATES>I mean, I could've passed her on the street, I guess.

477
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,630
<17-9,BECKETT>我说的是更为亲密的接触
<17-9,BECKETT>I'm actually talking about a more intimate interaction.

478
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,820
<17-9,BECKETT>你去过她的公寓吗
<17-9,BECKETT>Have you ever been in her apartment?

479
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,490
<17-10,GATES>我去过很过公寓
<17-10,GATES>I've been to a lot of apartments.

480
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,180
<17-11,BECKETT>这栋楼在35街和8街交口
<17-11,BECKETT>This building is at 35th and 8th.

481
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,710
<17-11,BECKETT>她住在301室
<17-11,BECKETT>She lived in 301.

482
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,620
<17-11,BECKETT>你去过这个公寓吗
<17-11,BECKETT>Were you ever in that particular unit?

483
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,920
<17-13,BECKETT>-没有  -那你能解释一下
<17-13,BECKETT>- No. - Well, then perhaps you can explain to me

484
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,880
<17-13,BECKETT>为什么我们在她尸体附近的
<17-13,BECKETT>how we found this nametag

485
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,520
<17-13,BECKETT>这个名牌上  找到了你的指纹
<17-13,BECKETT>with your fingerprint on it lying next to her body.

486
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,520
<17-14,GATES>我还真能解释这个疑问
<17-14,GATES>As a matter of fact, I can.

487
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,840
<18-1,ESPOSITO>我还真想听听他怎么解释
<18-1,ESPOSITO>Can't wait to hear this.

488
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,350
<19-2,BECKETT>-我在帝国道具行工作  -那又怎样
<19-2,BECKETT>- I work at the Empire Prop House. - And?

489
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,190
<19-3,GATES>那里出租拍电影电视用的道具
<19-3,GATES>And they rent props for movies and tv shows.

490
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,980
<19-4,BECKETT>我知道道具行什么意思
<19-4,BECKETT>I know what a prop house is.

491
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,400
<19-5,GATES>我的工作就是归整道具
<19-5,GATES>So that's my job. I stock props.

492
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,130
<19-5,GATES>有无数这样的名牌
<19-5,GATES>There's tons of nametags just like this one,

493
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,750
<19-5,GATES>我至少碰过其中的一大部分
<19-5,GATES>and I bet I've touched a hundred of 'em.

494
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,990
<19-5,GATES>-去查查  看看他说的是否属实  -这就去
<19-5,GATES>- Run that down. See if he's for real. - On it.

495
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,060
<19-5,GATES>我们没有你的工作记录
<19-5,GATES>There's no record of you having this job.

496
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,900
<19-5,GATES>他们都是私下发工资
<19-5,GATES>They pay me under the table.

497
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,510
<21-1,BECKETT>对了  你可以告我逃税
<21-1,BECKETT>Oh. Maybe you can get me for tax evasion.

498
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,670
<21-2,GATES>你所在的这个道具行
<21-2,GATES>This prop house where you say you work,

499
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,900
<21-3,BECKETT>那里有制服吗
<21-3,BECKETT>do they have uniforms there?

500
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,260
<21-4,GATES>-有啊  -煤气公司的制服也有吗
<21-4,GATES>- Sure. - Like gas company uniforms?

501
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,160
<21-6,GATES>你能想到的制服  他们都有
<21-6,GATES>Any kind of uniform you can think of, they got it.

502
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,680
<21-7,BECKETT>你有把制服带回家吗
<21-7,BECKETT>And have you ever taken any of these uniforms home?

503
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,370
<21-7,BECKETT>在你住所里有制服吗
<21-7,BECKETT>Do you have any in your possession?

504
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,200
<21-8,GATES>你们在搜查我的住处吗
<21-8,GATES>Are you guys searching my place?

505
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,800
<21-9,BECKETT>是的  那里有没有制服
<21-9,BECKETT>Yes, so if there are any uniforms there,

506
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,830
<21-9,BECKETT>你也许可以告诉我
<21-9,BECKETT>you may as well tell me.

507
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,500
<21-10,GATES>我想看看搜查令
<21-10,GATES>Wow. I'm gonna want to see the search warrant.

508
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,340
<21-11,BECKETT>为什么
<21-11,BECKETT>What for?

509
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,730
<21-12,GATES>这是我的合法权利
<21-12,GATES>It's my legal right.

510
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,160
<21-12,GATES>在你出示搜查令之前  我无可奉告
<21-12,GATES>And I'm done talking till you show it to me.

511
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,170
<21-12,GATES>所以你们最好采取积极措施
<21-12,GATES>So you better get with affirmative action back there

512
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,660
<21-12,GATES>拿出新的游戏计划
<21-12,GATES>and come up with a new game plan.

513
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,040
<22-1,BECKETT>他想看搜查令  借此窥探我们的战术
<22-1,BECKETT>He wants the search warrant to get a peek at our cards.

514
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,690
<22-2,CASTLE>这怎么就能让他窥探到呢
<22-2,CASTLE>How is that giving him a peek?

515
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,170
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>搜查令列明凶手使用的绳索  制服
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>The warrant lists ropes, uniforms,

516
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,410
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>还有金·福斯特  琳达·罗素
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>and other personal effects belonging to Kim Foster,

517
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,890
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>和其他6名受害人的私人物品
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>Linda Russo, and the other six triple killer victims.

518
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:33,700
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>查看搜查令
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>By looking at the warrant,

519
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,350
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>他可以估计我们的调查进展
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>he can gauge where we are in our investigation.

520
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,450
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>这可不是给他一小瞥
<22-3,MONTGOMERY>That's not giving him a peek.

521
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,970
<22-4,CASTLE>而是亮出我们的全部底牌
<22-4,CASTLE>That's showing him our whole hand.

522
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,180
<22-4,CASTLE>他会得知我们怀疑他就是连环凶手
<22-4,CASTLE>He'll know we think he's the triple killer.

523
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,070
<22-5,BECKETT>他已经知道了
<22-5,BECKETT>He already knows.

524
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,000
<22-6,ESPOSITO>帝国道具行证实盖茨在他们仓库工作
<22-6,ESPOSITO>Empire Prop confirmed that Gates works in their warehouse

525
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,640
<22-6,ESPOSITO>有权使用胸卡
<22-6,ESPOSITO>and had access to those tags.

526
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,000
<22-6,ESPOSITO>他在金·福斯特被杀当晚7:02打卡下班
<22-6,ESPOSITO>He clocked out at 7:02 the night of Kim Foster's murder.

527
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,940
<22-6,ESPOSITO>帝国道具行位于林肯广场  也就是说
<22-6,ESPOSITO>Now Empire is in Lincoln Square, which means

528
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,750
<22-6,ESPOSITO>他有足够的时间去到她公寓
<22-6,ESPOSITO>that he had enough time to get to her apartment

529
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,940
<22-6,ESPOSITO>在7:35按下门铃
<22-6,ESPOSITO>and push the intercom button by 7:35.

530
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,510
<22-7,MONTGOMERY>给他出示搜查令
<22-7,MONTGOMERY>Show him the warrant.

531
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,210
<22-7,MONTGOMERY>他可能会请律师  尽量阻止他
<22-7,MONTGOMERY>Odds are he will lawyer up, but try to stop him.

532
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,060
<22-8,CASTLE>她应该怎么做呢
<22-8,CASTLE>How is she supposed to do that?

533
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,530
<22-9,MONTGOMERY>她阻止不了他
<22-9,MONTGOMERY>I don't think she can.

534
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,210
<23-1,GATES>原来不仅是
<23-1,GATES>Turns out you got a lot more

535
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,590
<23-1,GATES>金·福斯特让你头痛
<23-1,GATES>on your mind than just Kim Foster.

536
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,020
<23-1,GATES>我还看到七个女人的名字
<23-1,GATES>I see the names of seven other women here.

537
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,910
<23-1,GATES>莱恩
<23-1,GATES>Ryan.

538
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,300
<24-1,RYAN>告诉我你有线索了
<24-1,RYAN>Tell me you got something.

539
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,180
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>目前还没有
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>Not so far.

540
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,930
<24-3,RYAN>没有绳索  没有制服
<24-3,RYAN>No rope, no uniform,

541
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,950
<24-3,RYAN>没有能把他和受害人联系在一起的线索
<24-3,RYAN>nothing that ties him to any of the victims.

542
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,580
<24-4,MONTGOMERY>继续找
<24-4,MONTGOMERY>Keep looking.

543
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,850
<24-4,MONTGOMERY>这个胸卡
<24-4,MONTGOMERY>The thing is, this nametag

544
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,960
<25-1,GATES>也许是让我受调查的原因
<25-1,GATES>is the probable cause for bringing me in.

545
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,770
<25-1,GATES>但我已经解释了指纹
<25-1,GATES>But I've explained the fingerprint

546
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,090
<25-1,GATES>现在  我相信你已经核查了我的故事
<25-1,GATES>And by now, I'm sure you've checked out my story.

547
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,300
<25-2,BECKETT>事实上  我们还在核实中
<25-2,BECKETT>Actually, we're still verifying that.

548
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,400
<25-3,GATES>我知道这程序
<25-3,GATES>I know how this works.

549
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,170
<25-3,GATES>你没有理由扣押我
<25-3,GATES>You do not have probable cause to hold me.

550
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,070
<26-1,CASTLE>是么  我们不能扣押他吗
<26-1,CASTLE>Is that right? Can't we hold him?

551
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,020
<26-2,MONTGOMERY>除非是在拍电影
<26-2,MONTGOMERY>Only in the movies.

552
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,250
<26-3,CASTLE>那他就可以走了吗
<26-3,CASTLE>So he can just walk outta here?

553
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,980
<26-4,MONTGOMERY>除非她证明他说谎
<26-4,MONTGOMERY>Unless she catches him in a lie and

554
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,200
<26-4,MONTGOMERY>这样才能扣押他
<26-4,MONTGOMERY>gives her cause to keep him.

555
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,770
<26-4,MONTGOMERY>我现在想离开了
<26-4,MONTGOMERY>I want to leave now.

556
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,150
<27-1,GATES>好吧
<27-1,GATES>Okay. Fine.

557
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,500
<27-2,BECKETT>你可以离开
<27-2,BECKETT>You can do that.

558
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,550
<27-2,BECKETT>你的律师到场离开的那一刻
<27-2,BECKETT>The second that you lawyer up and leave,

559
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,740
<27-2,BECKETT>你就成为我们的重点调查对象
<27-2,BECKETT>you become the focus of a major investigation.

560
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,130
<27-2,BECKETT>这给你生活带来的不便
<27-2,BECKETT>It will disrupt your life

561
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,100
<27-2,BECKETT>将超出你的想象
<27-2,BECKETT>in ways you can't even imagine.

562
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,330
<27-3,GATES>我已经是重点对象了
<27-3,GATES>I'm already the focus.

563
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,920
<27-4,BECKETT>是吗  你可以不是的
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah? Well, you don't have to be.

564
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,280
<27-4,BECKETT>说实话  我们并没有任何
<27-4,BECKETT>Look, the truth is, we don't have any evidence

565
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,360
<27-4,BECKETT>把你和那些谋杀案联系在一起的证据
<27-4,BECKETT>that connects you to those murders.

566
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,600
<27-4,BECKETT>这都归结于金·福斯特
<27-4,BECKETT>It all boils down to Kim Foster.

567
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,460
<27-4,BECKETT>即使你的指纹是碰巧在这胸卡上
<27-4,BECKETT>Even if your fingerprints got on this nametag by accident,

568
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,770
<27-4,BECKETT>根据你的前科  你依然是我们的嫌疑犯
<27-4,BECKETT>with your record, you still look like a suspect to us.

569
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,930
<27-4,BECKETT>金·福斯特对你是个麻烦
<27-4,BECKETT>So Kim Foster's a problem for you.

570
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,110
<27-4,BECKETT>但你可以清除这个麻烦
<27-4,BECKETT>But you can get that problem out of your way.

571
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,370
<27-4,BECKETT>你说你从未到过她的公寓
<27-4,BECKETT>You said you've never been to her apartment.

572
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,080
<27-4,BECKETT>昨晚7:35你在哪里
<27-4,BECKETT>Where were you at 7:35 last night?

573
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,570
<27-5,GATES>这对我有什么好处
<27-5,GATES>What's in that for me?

574
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,330
<27-6,BECKETT>如果你的不在场证据核实
<27-6,BECKETT>If your alibi checks out,

575
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,310
<27-6,BECKETT>我们就排除你的嫌疑
<27-6,BECKETT>then we move on.

576
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,010
<27-6,BECKETT>我们会追查真正的凶手
<27-6,BECKETT>We go after the real killer.

577
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,400
<27-7,GATES>我7点下班  如平常一样回家
<27-7,GATES>I left work at 7:00. I walked home like I always do.

578
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,400
<27-7,GATES>我到家大概是7:30  我整晚都在家
<27-7,GATES>I got home, maybe 7:30, and I stayed in all night.

579
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,570
<27-8,BECKETT>真是那样的吗
<27-8,BECKETT>And you're sure about that?

580
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,920
<27-9,GATES>当然
<27-9,GATES>Absolutely.

581
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,590
<28-1,ESPOSITO>这是盖茨家前的交通摄像头拍到的
<28-1,ESPOSITO>This is off of a traffic cam across from Gates' apartment.

582
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,780
<28-2,BECKETT>就是这个  这个可以证明他说谎
<28-2,BECKETT>Well, this is it. This will prove that he was lying.

583
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,360
<28-2,BECKETT>7:35时  他在去金·福斯特公寓的路上
<28-2,BECKETT>7:35, he was on his way to Kim Foster's apartment.

584
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,220
<28-2,BECKETT>等等
<28-2,BECKETT>wait. Whoa. Whoa.

585
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,630
<28-3,CASTLE>回放  停  停在那里
<28-3,CASTLE>Back--stop. Stop. Stop there.

586
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,100
<28-4,MONTGOMERY>是他  7:31
<28-4,MONTGOMERY>That's him. 7:31.

587
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,010
<28-5,BECKETT>不  不可能
<28-5,BECKETT>No, that can't be.

588
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,170
<28-6,ESPOSITO>是他  瞧  一样的鬓角
<28-6,ESPOSITO>It is. Look. Same sideburns.

589
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
<28-6,ESPOSITO>还有蛇的纹身
<28-6,ESPOSITO>And there's his snake tattoo.

590
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,370
<28-7,BECKETT>接着他从后门溜出去  前往金家里
<28-7,BECKETT>Well, then he slipped out the back and went to Kim's.

591
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,180
<28-8,CASTLE>他是怎样在4分钟内
<28-8,CASTLE>How would he get from 101st to midtown

592
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,930
<28-8,CASTLE>从101大街来到市中心  还换了衣服
<28-8,CASTLE>and change clothes in... four minutes?

593
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,430
<28-9,BECKETT>我不知道  但他确实做到了
<28-9,BECKETT>I don't know, but he did it.

594
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,460
<28-9,BECKETT>可以放大录像吗
<28-9,BECKETT>Can we enhance this video?

595
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,620
<28-10,MONTGOMERY>你可以随心所欲放大录像
<28-10,MONTGOMERY>You can enhance it all you want.

596
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,170
<28-10,MONTGOMERY>却不能改变事实  我们得放他走
<28-10,MONTGOMERY>Doesn't change the facts. We gotta cut him loose.

597
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,990
<28-11,BECKETT>头  我只是
<28-11,BECKETT>Sir, I just--

598
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,800
<28-12,MONTGOMERY>我也不希望是这样  探长
<28-12,MONTGOMERY>I don't like this any more than you, detective,

599
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,730
<28-12,MONTGOMERY>但他的不在场证据核实了
<28-12,MONTGOMERY>But he alibis out.

600
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,190
<29-1,BECKETT>看来我们搞错了
<29-1,BECKETT>Well, looks like we had it all wrong.

601
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,050
<29-1,BECKETT>你可以走了
<29-1,BECKETT>You're free to go.

602
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,070
<29-2,GATES>连环杀手还逍遥法外
<29-2,GATES>With this triple killer fella running around,

603
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,360
<29-2,GATES>你们最好看住你们爱的人
<29-2,GATES>you all better keep your loved ones close.

604
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,190
<29-2,GATES>我希望你们可以抓住他
<29-2,GATES>I sure hope you catch him.

605
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,900
<29-3,BECKETT>派人监视他
<29-3,BECKETT>Put a surveillance detail on him.

606
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,790
<29-3,BECKETT>我不想那个狗娘养的离开我们的视线
<29-3,BECKETT>I don't want that son of a bitch out of our sight.

607
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,790
<30-1,CASTLE>你今早看起来格外可爱
<30-1,CASTLE>Oh, don't you look adorable this morning?

608
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,000
<30-2,ALEXIS>我今天要见到我的神秘仰慕者
<30-2,ALEXIS>I meet my secret admirer today.

609
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,250
<30-3,CASLTE>我可以想象这画面
<30-3,CASLTE>Oh, I can just picture the scene.

610
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,160
<30-3,CASLTE>你和你的神秘仰慕者相约咖啡屋
<30-3,CASLTE>You and your secret admirer agree to meet in the cafeteria.

611
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,540
<30-3,CASLTE>你的目光扫过一张张长满痘痘的脸
<30-3,CASLTE>You scan the array of pimply faces.

612
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,340
<30-3,CASLTE>哪张脸是他的呢
<30-3,CASLTE>Which one is his?

613
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,610
<30-3,CASLTE>你那神秘仰慕者点了一客双份土豆泥
<30-3,CASLTE>Your secret admirer uses the prearranged signal

614
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,890
<30-3,CASLTE>那是你们预先约好的接头暗号
<30-3,CASLTE>of a double helping of mashed potatoes on his plate.

615
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,920
<30-3,CASLTE>他  帅气
<30-3,CASLTE>He's... handsome,

616
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,790
<30-3,CASLTE>虽不性感  但人畜无害的小模样分外撩人
<30-3,CASLTE>charming in an asexual, nonthreatening kind of way.

617
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,580
<30-4,ALEXIS>不错  但神秘远不及此
<30-4,ALEXIS>Nice try, but it'll be so much more mysterious.

618
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,100
<30-4,ALEXIS>听听这个
<30-4,ALEXIS>Listen to this.

619
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,250
<30-4,ALEXIS>如果你想见面  我5点会在草莓地
<30-4,ALEXIS>"If you want to meet, I'll be at strawberry fields at 5:00."

620
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,330
<30-4,ALEXIS>我希望你也在
<30-4,ALEXIS>"I hope you'll be there, too."

621
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,430
<30-5,CASTLE>不不不  不要去
<30-5,CASTLE>No. No, no, no. No, you're not going.

622
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,260
<30-6,ALEXIS>你之前可是一个劲鼓动我
<30-6,ALEXIS>Before you were practically forcing me

623
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,220
<30-6,ALEXIS>去查查他是谁
<30-6,ALEXIS>to find out who he is.

624
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,790
<30-7,CASTLE>不是去公园里  更不是你孤身一人
<30-7,CASTLE>Not in the park. Not by yourself.

625
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,020
<30-8,ALEXIS>我去过很多次了
<30-8,ALEXIS>But I've been there a million times-- well,

626
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,460
<30-9,CASTLE>等等  等等
<30-9,CASTLE>wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

627
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,260
<30-9,CASTLE>你第一张纸条是
<30-9,CASTLE>The first note you got--

628
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,770
<30-9,CASTLE>一束淡黄色头发
<30-9,CASTLE>"Rope of flaxen hair."

629
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,200
<30-9,CASTLE>一束  淡黄色  淡黄色就是金发
<30-9,CASTLE>"Rope"? "Flaxen"? Flaxen is blonde.

630
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,500
<30-10,ALEXIS>我是红头发  你反应过度了
<30-10,ALEXIS>I'm a redhead. You're totally overreacting.

631
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,420
<30-10,ALEXIS>我要去见我的神秘仰慕者  仅此而已
<30-10,ALEXIS>I'm meeting my secret admirer, and that's all there is to it.

632
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,080
<30-11,MARTHA>理查德  亲爱的  她是对的
<30-11,MARTHA>Richard, darling, she's right.

633
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,860
<30-11,MARTHA>你是无理取闹
<30-11,MARTHA>You are being utterly irrational.

634
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,500
<30-11,MARTHA>就好像当年我演那个
<30-11,MARTHA>It's like when I was doing,

635
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,880
<30-11,MARTHA>叫啥来着  《灵欲春宵》
<30-11,MARTHA>Uh, "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"

636
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,250
<30-11,MARTHA>我还以为我的替补想下毒害我
<30-11,MARTHA>And I thought my understudy was trying to poison me.

637
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,750
<30-12,CASTLE>没错  那日常血检还是我付的
<30-12,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. The daily blood tests I paid for.

638
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,700
<30-12,CASTLE>等等  她确实下毒害你了
<30-12,CASTLE>Wait. She did poison you.

639
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,890
<30-12,CASTLE>她给你的瑞士巧克力是泻药
<30-12,CASTLE>The swiss chocolate she gave you was a laxative.

640
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,580
<30-13,MARTHA>给我的表演增加了紧迫感
<30-13,MARTHA>It added a certain urgency to my performance.

641
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,550
<30-13,MARTHA>但问题是  你让我也疑神疑鬼了
<30-13,MARTHA>But the point is, you indulged my paranoia.

642
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,070
<30-13,MARTHA>因此  我5点要到公园里
<30-13,MARTHA>So therefore, I am going to be in the park, 5:00,

643
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,430
<30-13,MARTHA>在合适的远处确保
<30-13,MARTHA>at a discreet distance to make sure

644
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,010
<30-13,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯的神秘爱慕者不是斧头杀手
<30-13,MARTHA>that Alexis' secret admirer is not an ax murderer.

645
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,090
<30-14,CASTLE>-谢谢  -不客气
<30-14,CASTLE>- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

646
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,100
<30-16,CASTLE>-告诉我你已经逮捕了盖茨  -还早着呢
<30-16,CASTLE>- Tell me you've arrested Gates.  - Not even close.

647
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,720
<30-17,BECKETT>我不知道怎么办  卡塞尔
<30-17,BECKETT>I mean, I don't know how, Castle,

648
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,150
<30-17,BECKETT>他杀了金·福斯特  他还会继续杀人
<30-17,BECKETT>but he killed Kim Foster, and he's gonna do it again.

649
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,880
<30-18,CASTLE>一点进展都没吗
<30-18,CASTLE>There's been no developments?

650
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,290
<30-18,CASTLE>通常你打给我都有线索
<30-18,CASTLE>Usually you call me with news.

651
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,840
<30-18,CASTLE>你打来是询问我的意见
<30-18,CASTLE>You called to seek my counsel.

652
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,640
<30-19,BECKETT>我可没这么说啊
<30-19,BECKETT>I wouldn't say it exactly like that.

653
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,720
<30-19,BECKETT>不不不
<30-19,BECKETT>No, no, no.

654
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,680
<30-20,CASTLE>你希望我有天马行空的理论
<30-20,CASTLE>You were hoping I had some wild theory,

655
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,020
<30-20,CASTLE>类似敏锐的洞察力
<30-20,CASTLE>some sort of penetrating insight

656
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,590
<30-20,CASTLE>可以让我们找到突破口
<30-20,CASTLE>that would lead us to a breakthrough.

657
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,640
<30-21,BECKETT>那你有吗
<30-21,BECKETT>Well... Do you?

658
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,190
<30-22,CASTLE>没有  一筹莫展
<30-22,CASTLE>Nah! I got nothin'.

659
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,740
<30-23,BECKETT>我只需要一丝证据
<30-23,BECKETT>I just need some piece of evidence.

660
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,750
<30-23,BECKETT>他跟谁说过  任何事都好
<30-23,BECKETT>I mean, someone that he talked to, anything.

661
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,520
<30-24,CASTLE>如果盖茨向杰瑞
<30-24,CASTLE>What if Gates confided in Jerry

662
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,580
<30-24,CASTLE>透露之前的谋杀案
<30-24,CASTLE>about the previous murders?

663
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,880
<30-25,BECKETT>杰瑞不会告诉我们
<30-25,BECKETT>Yeah, well, Jerry's not gonna talk to us.

664
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,530
<30-25,BECKETT>他今早在监狱里被痛打了一顿
<30-25,BECKETT>He got beaten up in the prison yard this morning,

665
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,670
<30-25,BECKETT>他觉得盖茨跟这事有关
<30-25,BECKETT>and he thinks that Gates had something to do with it.

666
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,370
<30-26,CASTLE>听起来盖茨害怕
<30-26,CASTLE>Sounds like Gates is afraid of

667
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,340
<30-26,CASTLE>杰瑞·泰森知道的一些事
<30-26,CASTLE>what Jerry Tyson knows.

668
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,410
<31-1,JERRY>离我远点
<31-1,JERRY>Get the hell away from me.

669
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,700
<31-2,BECKETT>听着  杰瑞  我们只需要再多一点
<31-2,BECKETT>Listen, Jerry, we just need a little more information

670
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,700
<31-2,BECKETT>马库斯·盖茨的资料

673
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,500
<31-4,BECKETT>那如果我们让你出去呢
<31-4,BECKETT>Not if we get you out.

674
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,790
<31-4,BECKETT>检察官愿意让你提早出狱
<31-4,BECKETT>The D.A. has agreed to get you an early release

675
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,360
<31-4,BECKETT>而且有警方保护
<31-4,BECKETT>and police protection.

676
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,860
<31-5,JERRY>盖茨知道我有女朋友
<31-5,JERRY>Gates knows about my girlfriend

677
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,280
<31-5,JERRY>唐娜·加拉格  他会找上她的
<31-5,JERRY>Donna Gallagher. He could get to her, too.

678
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,810
<31-6,BECKETT>我们保证他不会的
<31-6,BECKETT>Well, then we'll make sure he doesn't.

679
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,220
<31-6,BECKETT>我们必须抓住凶手  杰瑞
<31-6,BECKETT>We gotta move on this, Jerry.

680
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,380
<31-6,BECKETT>最后机会了
<31-6,BECKETT>Last chance.

683
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,180
<31-8,CASTLE>我们要知道
<31-8,CASTLE>We need to know

684
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
<31-8,CASTLE>盖茨曾经说过他袭击女人的事吗
<31-8,CASTLE>did Gates ever talk to you about attacking women?

685
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,280
<31-9,JERRY>有一次
<31-9,JERRY>There was this one time.

686
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,830
<31-9,JERRY>他告诉我有个女人  萨拉  住在苏活区
<31-9,JERRY>He told me about this chick, um, Sara--down in soho.

687
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,730
<31-10,CASTLE>很可能是萨拉·唐森
<31-10,CASTLE>that could be Sara Townsend.

688
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,620
<31-11,JERRY>他告诉我他怎样闯进她家
<31-11,JERRY>He told me about how he busted into her place

689
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,880
<31-11,JERRY>然后事情失去控制
<31-11,JERRY>and things got outta control,

690
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,020
<31-11,JERRY>最后肯定变得非常糟
<31-11,JERRY>but it must been pretty bad,

691
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,000
<31-11,JERRY>因为盖茨说
<31-11,JERRY>cause Gates said

692
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,400
<31-11,JERRY>他担心会被警察逮捕
<31-11,JERRY>he was worried that the cops were after him,

693
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,230
<31-11,JERRY>于是他砸了一家伙的头
<31-11,JERRY>so he busts a bottle over this guy's head

694
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,350
<31-11,JERRY>进了监狱
<31-11,JERRY>to get himself locked up.

695
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,830
<31-11,JERRY>这样  他就有段时间可以安枕无忧了
<31-11,JERRY>That way, he'd be under the radar for a while.

696
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:53,960
<31-12,BECKETT>这是不错的开始
<31-12,BECKETT>That's a good start.

697
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,480
<31-12,BECKETT>我是警探莱恩
<31-12,BECKETT>My name's detective Ryan.

698
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,630
<32-1,RYAN>我现在是你的新死党了
<32-1,RYAN>I'm your new best friend.

699
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,200
<32-1,RYAN>这间旅馆在我们的监控下
<32-1,RYAN>This motel's under surveillance.

700
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,220
<32-1,RYAN>为了你的自身安全  你不能离开或打电话
<32-1,RYAN>For your own safety, you cannot leave or use the phone.

701
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,860
<32-1,RYAN>现在  你和我要
<32-1,RYAN>Right now, you and I

702
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,060
<32-1,RYAN>回想一遍盖茨跟你说过的任何事
<32-1,RYAN>need to go over everything Gates ever said to you,

703
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,540
<32-1,RYAN>甚至是些很白目或者不重要的事
<32-1,RYAN>even if it seems stupid or unimportant.

704
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,990
<32-1,RYAN>杰瑞的话与事实相符
<32-1,RYAN>Jerry's story squares with the facts.

705
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,840
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>萨拉·唐森是盖茨的第六个受害者
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>Sara Townsend was Gates' sixth victim,

706
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,870
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>而且她住在苏活区
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>and she lived in soho.

707
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,270
<33-2,CASTLE>那用瓶子砸人被逮捕呢
<33-2,CASTLE>What about assault with a deadly bottle?

708
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,230
<33-3,MONTGOMERY>也证实了  是在萨拉遇害后的一周
<33-3,MONTGOMERY>That fits, too. It came a week after Sara's death.

709
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,480
<33-3,MONTGOMERY>看来盖茨是故意让自己进监狱的
<33-3,MONTGOMERY>Looks like Gates sent himself up the river on purpose.

710
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,920
<33-4,CASTLE>仍然不足以逮捕他  对吧
<33-4,CASTLE>It's still not enough to arrest him, is it?

711
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,130
<33-5,MONTGOMERY>不  但要是杰瑞继续提供情报
<33-5,MONTGOMERY>No, but if Jerry has more tidbits like that,

712
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,070
<33-5,MONTGOMERY>或许能帮我们找到证据
<33-5,MONTGOMERY>it may help us get there.

713
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,040
<33-6,ESPOSITO>我们找不到唐娜·加拉格
<33-6,ESPOSITO>Yo, we can't locate Donna Gallagher,

714
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,070
<33-6,ESPOSITO>而且她也没有听电话
<33-6,ESPOSITO>and she's not picking up her cell.

715
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,470
<33-7,BECKETT>长官  盖茨在哪里
<33-7,BECKETT>Sir, where is Gates now?

716
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,570
<33-8,MONTGOMERY>在他的公寓  监控器显示
<33-8,MONTGOMERY>At his apartment. Surveillance says

717
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,670
<33-8,MONTGOMERY>他并没有离开大厦
<33-8,MONTGOMERY>he hasn't left the building.

718
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,770
<33-9,BECKETT>联络唐娜的朋友和家人
<33-9,BECKETT>Contact Donna's friends and family.

719
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,700
<33-9,BECKETT>找出她在哪里
<33-9,BECKETT>Find out where she is.

720
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,610
<33-9,BECKETT>-我告诉杰瑞会保证她的安全  -好的
<33-9,BECKETT>- I told Jerry we'd keep her safe. - All right.

721
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,970
<34-1,JERRY>你不能就这样逮捕他吗
<34-1,JERRY>Can't you just arrest this guy?

722
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,550
<34-1,JERRY>我是说  你知道是他做的
<34-1,JERRY>I mean, you know he did these things.

723
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,870
<34-2,RYAN>他有不在场证明
<34-2,RYAN>He has an alibi.

724
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,170
<34-2,RYAN>我们没法将他与犯罪现场联系起来
<34-2,RYAN>We can't put him at the murder scene.

725
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,600
<34-3,JERRY>他有时候合伙犯案  你知道的吧
<34-3,JERRY>He used partners sometimes. You know that, right?

726
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,130
<34-4,RYAN>同伙
<34-4,RYAN>Partner?

727
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,400
<34-5,RYAN>我们从没调查过任何同伙
<34-5,RYAN>We never ran across anything about a partner.

728
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,030
<34-6,JERRY>噢  没错  他说
<34-6,JERRY>Oh, yeah. He said

729
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,660
<34-6,JERRY>有个同伙帮他逃脱的
<34-6,JERRY>a-a partner helps him get away with things.

730
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,160
<34-6,JERRY>我想起来了
<34-6,JERRY>Though I-I get the idea

731
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,650
<34-6,JERRY>他从不跟同一个人合作两次
<34-6,JERRY>he never used the same partner twice.

732
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,490
<35-1,BECKETT>杰瑞说盖茨有同伙
<35-1,BECKETT>Jerry said that Gates used a partner.

733
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,690
<35-2,CASTLE>同伙  这就解释了他的不在场证明
<35-2,CASTLE>A partner. That's why he has an alibi.

734
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,880
<35-2,CASTLE>让你的手下逮捕盖茨
<35-2,CASTLE>Tell your guys to arrest Gates.

735
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,300
<35-2,CASTLE>我知道他怎么杀害金·福斯特了  好的
<35-2,CASTLE>I know how he killed Kim Foster. Okay.

736
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,900
<36-1,CASTLE>盖茨说他每晚都在
<36-1,CASTLE>Gates said he walks home every night

737
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,900
<36-1,CASTLE>同一时间回家的  是吧
<36-1,CASTLE>at the same time, right?

738
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,060
<36-1,CASTLE>所以这道路监控器记录了那天
<36-1,CASTLE>So this traffic cam footage from the day be--

739
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,870
<36-1,CASTLE>等等  他在这里
<36-1,CASTLE>Wait. There he is.

740
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,390
<36-1,CASTLE>他在这里  好的  右边是盖茨
<36-1,CASTLE>There he is. Okay. That's Gates on the right

741
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,540
<36-2,CASTLE>在金·福斯特遇害那晚的录像
<36-2,CASTLE>the night of Kim Foster's murder.

742
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,740
<36-2,CASTLE>左边的是较早时间盖茨的录像
<36-2,CASTLE>On the left, Gates from a night earlier.

743
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,020
<36-2,CASTLE>-这里有什么不同  -他太矮了
<36-2,CASTLE>- What's wrong with this picture? - He's too short.

744
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,010
<36-4,CASTLE>所以说  要不是盖茨缩水了
<36-4,CASTLE>So either Gates shrank...

745
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,020
<36-5,BECKETT>要不这就是他的同伙
<36-5,BECKETT>Or this is his partner.

746
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,520
<36-6,CASTLE>他穿着盖茨的衣服
<36-6,CASTLE>He wore Gates' clothing.

747
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,110
<36-6,CASTLE>盖茨能去道具屋拿假发
<36-6,CASTLE>Gates would've had access to wigs and disguises

748
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,970
<36-6,CASTLE>和伪装物品
<36-6,CASTLE>from the prop house.

749
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,240
<36-6,CASTLE>这就是为什么盖茨可以同时
<36-6,CASTLE>That's how Gates can be at

750
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,540
<36-6,CASTLE>-出现在两个地方  -等等
<36-6,CASTLE>- two places at once. - Wait.

751
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,360
<36-7,ESPOSITO>这是什么
<36-7,ESPOSITO>What's that?

752
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,210
<36-8,CASTLE>呃  这是反光
<36-8,CASTLE>Uh, it's a reflection

753
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,240
<36-8,CASTLE>这是  这是汗的反光  汗的反光
<36-8,CASTLE>From... from s--from sweat! From sweat!

754
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,650
<36-8,CASTLE>那是"瀑布汗先生"哎
<36-8,CASTLE>That's sweaty von sweats-a-lot!

755
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,750
<36-9,BECKETT>那是保罗·麦卡德
<36-9,BECKETT>That's Paul Mccardle.

756
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,750
<36-9,BECKETT>这就是为什么他要监视琳达·罗素
<36-9,BECKETT>That's why he was watching Linda Russo.

757
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,750
<36-9,BECKETT>他就是同伙  他跟盖茨一起作案
<36-9,BECKETT>He's the partner. He was working with Gates.

758
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,240
<36-10,ESPOSITO>我要全面通缉麦卡德
<36-10,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna put an A.P.B. out on Mccardle.

759
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,800
<36-11,MONTGOMERY>你最好把马库斯·盖茨也加上去
<36-11,MONTGOMERY>You better add Marcus Gates to that list.

760
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,220
<36-12,BECKETT>长官  警员进他家后
<36-12,BECKETT>Sir? When officers busted in to his place,

761
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,440
<36-13,MONTGOMERY>只找到一条绳梯向下连接着
<36-13,MONTGOMERY>all they found was a rope ladder going down to the rooftop

762
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,680
<36-13,MONTGOMERY>隔壁大厦的顶楼  盖茨逃走了
<36-13,MONTGOMERY>of the building next door. Gates is gone.

763
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,550
<37-1,MONTGOMERY>已经派警员搜查了那片区域
<37-1,MONTGOMERY>Got uniforms searching the area.

764
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,420
<37-1,MONTGOMERY>-没有盖茨的消息  -可能他找上唐娜了
<37-1,MONTGOMERY>- No sign of Gates. - Maybe he's going after Donna.

765
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,790
<37-2,CASTLE>这样他还可以要挟杰瑞
<37-2,CASTLE>That way he could punish Jerry, too.

766
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,090
<37-3,MONTGOMERY>有任何线索她在哪里吗
<37-3,MONTGOMERY>We got any leads on her where abouts?

767
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,930
<37-4,BECKETT>埃斯波西托正和她的朋友通话
<37-4,BECKETT>Esposito's talking to her friends right now,

768
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,230
<37-4,BECKETT>但仍然找不到她
<37-4,BECKETT>but she's still in the wind.

769
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,130
<37-5,RYAN>还有保罗·麦卡德和他的车也不见了
<37-5,RYAN>So is Paul Mccardle. His car is gone, and he is, too.

770
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,140
<37-5,RYAN>他的前妻也不知道他在哪里
<37-5,RYAN>Ex-wife has no idea where he is either.

771
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,640
<37-5,RYAN>但我查出他和盖茨的关系了
<37-5,RYAN>But I did find out how he and Gates are connected.

772
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,280
<37-5,RYAN>他们曾经一起在收养家庭生活
<37-5,RYAN>They were in a foster home together.

773
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,290
<37-6,BECKETT>那么他们俩可能一起潜逃
<37-6,BECKETT>So Mccardle could be with Gates.

774
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,760
<37-7,MONTGOMERY>将盖茨和麦卡德的照片发布在
<37-7,MONTGOMERY>Get photos of Gates and Mccardle

775
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,620
<37-7,MONTGOMERY>-飞机  巴士还有火车站  -好的
<37-7,MONTGOMERY>- to airport, bus, and train stations. - Yeah.

777
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,960
<37-9,ESPOSITO>唐娜的邻居刚刚告诉我
<37-9,ESPOSITO>One of Donna's neighbors just told me

778
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,400
<37-9,ESPOSITO>她暂住在她姐姐家帮忙看门
<37-9,ESPOSITO>she's house-sitting at her cousin's.

779
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
<37-10,BECKETT>你有她的地址吗
<37-10,BECKETT>Do you have an address?

780
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,800
<37-11,ESPOSITO>-是的  但盖茨也是  -有家伙
<37-11,ESPOSITO>- Yeah, but so does Gates. - Some guy dressed as

781
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,200
<37-11,ESPOSITO>打扮成邮递员说有唐娜的包裹
<37-11,ESPOSITO>a messenger said he had a delivery for Donna.

782
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,180
<37-12,BECKETT>马上过去那里
<37-12,BECKETT>Get there now.

783
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,570
<38-1,ESPOSITO>纽约警局
<38-1,ESPOSITO>NYPD!

784
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,350
<38-2,ESPOSITO>起来  从她身上起来
<38-2,ESPOSITO>Get off! Get off her! Aah!

785
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,240
<38-3,ESPOSITO>我看你这次还怎么狡辩
<38-3,ESPOSITO>I'd like to see you talk your way out of this one.

786
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,580
<38-4,GATES>我会试着不让你失望
<38-4,GATES>I'll try not to disappoint you.

787
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,610
<38-4,GATES>我们在你口袋里找到了与三重杀手
<38-4,GATES>We found the same kind of rope in your pocket

788
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,120
<39-1,BECKETT>作案时一模一样的绳子
<39-1,BECKETT>As was used by the triple killer.

789
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,820
<39-2,GATES>我记得  男人是允许携带绳子的
<39-2,GATES>Last I checked, a man's allowed to carry rope.

790
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,490
<39-3,BECKETT>我觉得你希望被捕的  马库斯
<39-3,BECKETT>I think you wanted to get caught, Marcus.

791
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,470
<39-3,BECKETT>你在外面的世界什么也没有
<39-3,BECKETT>There's nothing left for you out here,

792
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,710
<39-3,BECKETT>但在监狱里  人们怕你
<39-3,BECKETT>But in prison, people fear you.

793
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,960
<39-3,BECKETT>你是老大
<39-3,BECKETT>You're a shot caller.

794
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,920
<39-3,BECKETT>而你希望能再次呼风唤雨
<39-3,BECKETT>And you wanted to be king again.

795
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,390
<39-3,BECKETT>你剩下要做的事
<39-3,BECKETT>All's that left for you to do

796
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,670
<39-3,BECKETT>就是再次犯案让我们查出
<39-3,BECKETT>is to clear the air of all these murders

797
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,910
<39-3,BECKETT>你就是凶手
<39-3,BECKETT>and be done with it all.

798
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,180
<39-4,GATES>想得美
<39-4,GATES>Nice try.

799
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,010
<40-1,MONTGOMERY>这家伙永远不会乖乖就范的
<40-1,MONTGOMERY>This guy is never gonna give it up.

800
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,080
<40-2,BECKETT>长官  我需要他的把柄  但我什么都没有
<40-2,BECKETT>Sir, I need leverage and I don't have any.

801
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,850
<40-2,BECKETT>没有任何目击者
<40-2,BECKETT>There's no witnesses.

802
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,750
<40-2,BECKETT>没有证据能将他与任何凶杀案联系起来
<40-2,BECKETT>There's no proof that connects him to any of the murders.

803
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,210
<40-2,BECKETT>唯一能起诉他的就是控告他袭击
<40-2,BECKETT>The only thing that I've got him on is an assault charge.

804
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,750
<40-3,RYAN>嘿  麦卡德的全国通缉有消息了
<40-3,RYAN>Hey, we just got a hit on Mccardle's A.P.B.

805
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,190
<40-3,RYAN>他在圣本杰明医院
<40-3,RYAN>He's at st. Benjamin's hospital.

806
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,190
<40-4,CASTLE>或许盖茨已经找上他了
<40-4,CASTLE>Maybe Gates got to him.

807
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,220
<40-5,BECKETT>长官  要是我能让麦卡德供出他
<40-5,BECKETT>Sir, if I can get Mccardle to roll.

808
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,000
<40-6,MONTGOMERY>快去
<40-6,MONTGOMERY>go!

809
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,210
<40-8,CASTLE>是的  呃  嘿  嗯
<40-8,CASTLE>Yeah. Uh, hey, um--

810
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,920
<40-9,BECKETT>好吧  卡塞尔  去吧  但不要妨碍他
<40-9,BECKETT>Okay, fine, Castle, go. Just stay out of his way.

811
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,060
<40-9,BECKETT>还有  莱恩
<40-9,BECKETT>And, Ryan...

812
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,310
<40-9,BECKETT>给我些能让他开口的东西
<40-9,BECKETT>Get me something I can break him with.

813
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,280
<41-1,RYAN>打扰一下
<41-1,RYAN>Excuse me.

814
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,730
<41-1,RYAN>我是警探莱恩  我想跟麦卡德先生说句话
<41-1,RYAN>I'm detective ryan. We'd like a word with mr. Mccardle.

815
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,230
<41-2,DOCTOR>你不能  他刚刚做完心脏手术
<41-2,DOCTOR>You can't have one. He just got out of heart surgery.

816
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,370
<41-3,RYAN>什么病
<41-3,RYAN>What for?

817
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,180
<41-4,DOCTOR>先天性瓣膜缺损
<41-4,DOCTOR>A congenital valve defect.

818
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,870
<41-5,CASTLE>这病有可能导致出汗过度吗
<41-5,CASTLE>Would that cause excessive sweating, by any chance?

819
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,830
<41-6,DOCTOR>是的  还有其他更严重的症状
<41-6,DOCTOR>Well, among other, more serious symptoms.

820
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,130
<41-6,DOCTOR>他急需做这个手术已经超过一年
<41-6,DOCTOR>He's been in dire need of surgery for over a year.

821
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,580
<41-7,CASTLE>为什么现在才做
<41-7,CASTLE>So why get it now?

822
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
<41-8,DOCTOR>他终于筹到钱了
<41-8,DOCTOR>Well, he finally came up with the money.

823
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,480
<41-8,DOCTOR>这手术费用高昂
<41-8,DOCTOR>It's kind of a costly procedure.

824
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,660
<41-9,RYAN>-有多贵  -大概十万美金
<41-9,RYAN>- How costly? - About $100,000.

825
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,870
<41-11,RYAN>呃  是谁付帐的
<41-11,RYAN>Uh... Who footed the bill?

826
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,060
<41-12,DOCTOR>那是保密消息
<41-12,DOCTOR>That's confidential information.

827
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,500
<41-13,CASTLE>我们问过她前妻
<41-13,CASTLE>You spoke to his ex-wife

828
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,900
<41-13,CASTLE>她甚至不知道他在这里
<41-13,CASTLE>she didn't even know he was here.

829
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,260
<41-14,RYAN>她痛恨这家伙  那么这花是谁送的
<41-14,RYAN>She hated the guy. So who sent the flowers?

831
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,720
<42-2,CASTLE>麦卡德的手术跟盖茨一点关系也没有
<42-2,CASTLE>Mccardle's surgery had nothing to do with Gates.

832
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,640
<42-2,CASTLE>事实上  盖茨给他送了康复鲜花
<42-2,CASTLE>In fact, Gates sent him get-well flowers.

833
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,810
<42-3,BECKETT>这代表他关心他的收养兄弟
<42-3,BECKETT>Which means he cares about his foster brother.

834
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,430
<42-4,CASTLE>这就是你要的把柄
<42-4,CASTLE>That's your leverage.

835
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,700
<42-4,CASTLE>你需要我们等麦卡德录口供吗
<42-4,CASTLE>You still need us to wait and talk to Mccardle?

836
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,650
<42-5,BECKETT>不  告诉杰瑞他女朋友没事
<42-5,BECKETT>No. Tell Jerry his girlfriend's fine,

837
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,560
<42-5,BECKETT>而且他不用再因为盖茨担惊受怕了
<42-5,BECKETT>and he doesn't have to worry about Gates anymore.

838
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,740
<43-1,GATES>你不断回来索要更多的东西
<43-1,GATES>You keep coming back for more.

839
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,020
<43-1,GATES>这种女人正合我意
<43-1,GATES>I look for that in a woman.

840
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,350
<43-2,BECKETT>我们找到保罗了  他在圣本杰明医院
<43-2,BECKETT>We found Paul. He's at st. Benjamin's.

841
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,420
<43-2,BECKETT>我们知道他在金·福斯特遇害的那晚
<43-2,BECKETT>We know that he pretended to be you

842
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,740
<43-2,BECKETT>装扮成你的样子了
<43-2,BECKETT>the night of Kim Foster's murder,

843
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,890
<43-2,BECKETT>我会让他作供指证你的
<43-2,BECKETT>and I'm gonna get him to testify against you.

844
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,750
<43-3,GATES>你不了解保罗
<43-3,GATES>You don't know Paul.

845
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,150
<43-4,BECKETT>那么我们就另寻他法
<43-4,BECKETT>Well, then we'll go another way.

846
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,110
<43-4,BECKETT>我会以谋杀罪从犯的名义起诉他
<43-4,BECKETT>I'll charge him with accessory to murder.

847
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,860
<43-5,GATES>你不能这么做的
<43-5,GATES>You can't do that.

848
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:32,910
<43-6,BECKETT>我们当然可以
<43-6,BECKETT>Actually, we can.

849
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,550
<43-6,BECKETT>新新监狱对你来说可能是游乐场
<43-6,BECKETT>Sing Sing might have been a picnic for you,

850
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,330
<43-6,BECKETT>但是你觉得保罗在里面能撑多久
<43-6,BECKETT>but how long do you think Paul is gonna survive in there?

851
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,770
<43-7,GATES>保罗对谋杀根本一无所知
<43-7,GATES>Paul didn't know what was going on.

852
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,770
<43-7,GATES>他只是按我的去做而已
<43-7,GATES>He only did what I told him.

853
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,430
<43-8,BECKETT>想要证明这一点
<43-8,BECKETT>The only way to prove that

854
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,540
<43-8,BECKETT>你就要把完整的故事讲给我听
<43-8,BECKETT>is by telling me the whole story.

855
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,530
<43-9,GATES>你要保证保罗无罪
<43-9,GATES>Only if Paul gets immunity.

856
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,250
<43-9,GATES>白纸黑字写下来
<43-9,GATES>And I want that in writing.

857
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,010
<43-9,GATES>就是他吗
<43-9,GATES>Is that him?

858
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,590
<44-1,CAL>就是他
<44-1,CAL>That's him.

859
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,610
<44-3,BECKETT>盖茨先生  你承认杀害金·福斯特吗
<44-3,BECKETT>Mr. Gates, did you kill Kim Foster?

860
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,100
<44-4,GATES>是的  她们都是我杀的
<44-4,GATES>Yes. I killed all of them.

861
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,320
<44-5,BECKETT>说出她们的名字
<44-5,BECKETT>I want their names.

862
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,450
<44-5,BECKETT>琳达·罗素
<44-5,BECKETT>Linda Russo,

863
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,980
<44-6,GATES>在那之前还有萨拉·唐森
<44-6,GATES>before that, it was Sara Townsend,

864
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,960
<44-6,GATES>和其他五个女人
<44-6,GATES>and five other women.

865
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,170
<45-1,RYAN>盖茨全招了
<45-1,RYAN>Gates confessed to everything.

866
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,930
<45-1,RYAN>得给我们这帮好人加上一分
<45-1,RYAN>We get to chalk one up for the good guys.

867
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,580
<45-2,CASTLE>-干吗拉着个脸  -这要是我的书的话
<45-2,CASTLE>- Why the long face?  - Because if this were a book,

868
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,720
<45-2,CASTLE>我还是搞不明白那个手术的事
<45-2,CASTLE>I still wouldn't understand the operation.

869
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,890
<45-3,RYAN>心脏瓣膜替换术
<45-3,RYAN>Valve replacement.

870
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,300
<45-3,RYAN>没什么大不了的  我爸也做过
<45-3,RYAN>It's no big deal. My dad had one.

871
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,530
<45-4,CASTLE>我知道  可问题是他要是没钱的话
<45-4,CASTLE>Yeah, it is if you don't have the money.

872
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,840
<45-4,CASTLE>手术费是哪来的呢
<45-4,CASTLE>Who paid for it?

873
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,140
<45-5,RYAN>我猜是盖茨给的
<45-5,RYAN>I'm guessing Gates did.

874
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,270
<45-5,RYAN>也许他入狱前藏了一笔钱
<45-5,RYAN>Maybe he stashed away some money from before prison.

875
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
<45-6,CASTLE>有可能  但是他都出狱一个月了
<45-6,CASTLE>Yeah, but he was out of prison for a month.

876
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,490
<45-6,CASTLE>为什么等到现在才给麦卡德做手术呢
<45-6,CASTLE>Why wait till now to do Mccardle's operation?

877
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,510
<45-7,RYAN>他需要麦卡德帮他完成琳达·罗素
<45-7,RYAN>Well, he needed Mccardle to help him with Linda Russo

878
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,040
<45-8,CASTLE>-和金·福斯特的谋杀  -可能吧
<45-8,CASTLE>- and Kim Foster.  - Yeah, I guess.

879
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,410
<45-9,RYAN>打包呢
<45-9,RYAN>Packing up?

880
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,590
<45-10,JERRY>只是整理一下我的东西
<45-10,JERRY>Oh, just getting my stuff together.

881
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,300
<45-11,CASTLE>这些都是监狱里拿出来的
<45-11,CASTLE>All that stuff from prison?

882
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,370
<45-12,JERRY>住的久了东西自然就多了
<45-12,JERRY>Well, you accumulate a lot of stuff,

883
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,030
<45-12,JERRY>在监狱里也不例外
<45-12,JERRY>you know, even in the slammer.

884
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,860
<45-13,RYAN>你对盖茨的推测是正确的
<45-13,RYAN>You were right about Gates.

885
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,940
<45-13,RYAN>他的确去找唐娜了
<45-13,RYAN>He did try to go after Donna.

886
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,370
<45-14,JERRY>-但是她现在没事了  -那盖茨呢
<45-14,JERRY>- But she's okay.  - And Gates?

887
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,970
<45-15,RYAN>他招供了  这件事结束了
<45-15,RYAN>He confessed. It's all over.

888
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,360
<45-16,JERRY>谢天谢地
<45-16,JERRY>Thank god.

889
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,940
<45-17,CASTLE>你都不问问到底发生了什么吗
<45-17,CASTLE>Aren't you gonna ask what happened?

890
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,690
<45-17,CASTLE>你都没问过你女朋友唐娜怎么样
<45-17,CASTLE>To your girlfriend Donna -- you didn't ask about her.

891
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,940
<45-17,CASTLE>你只是问了盖茨而已  这不合理呀
<45-17,CASTLE>You just asked about Gates. Doesn't make any sense,

892
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,800
<45-17,CASTLE>除非
<45-17,CASTLE>unless...

893
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,470
<45-18,CASTLE>你早就计划好了她的死
<45-18,CASTLE>She was supposed to die.

894
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,180
<45-19,JERRY>我不知道你在说什么
<45-19,JERRY>I-I don't know what y --

895
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,650
<45-20,CASTLE>直到你出狱了
<45-20,CASTLE>And Mccardle didn't get the money for the surgery

896
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,890
<45-20,CASTLE>麦卡德才有钱做手术
<45-20,CASTLE>until after you got out of prison.

897
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,510
<45-20,CASTLE>他还要毁灭所有曾经入狱的证据
<45-20,CASTLE>He's removing all evidence he was even there.

898
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,860
<45-20,CASTLE>是他  他才是三重杀手
<45-20,CASTLE>It was him all along. He's the real triple killer.

899
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,070
<45-21,JERRY>所控属实
<45-21,JERRY>Guilty as charged.

900
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,850
<46-1,MONTGOMERY>-干得好  探长  -谢谢  头
<46-1,MONTGOMERY>- Excellent work, detective.  - Thank you, sir.

901
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,090
<46-2,BECKETT>希望你对卡塞尔也说一样的话
<46-2,BECKETT>I hope you say the same to Castle.

902
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:16,900
<46-2,BECKETT>倒是他人跑哪去了
<46-2,BECKETT>Where is he, by the way?

903
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,030
<46-2,BECKETT>我还以为他们早就该回来了呢
<46-2,BECKETT>I thought that they would be back by now.

904
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,730
<46-3,MONTGOMERY>也许他跟莱恩去喝上一杯了
<46-3,MONTGOMERY>Maybe he and Ryan went out for a cold one.

905
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,210
<46-3,MONTGOMERY>这么一天下来  我也要喝上一杯
<46-3,MONTGOMERY>After a day like today, that's what I'm doing.

906
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,660
<46-4,BECKETT>-想一起去吗  -当然  愿意奉陪
<46-4,BECKETT>- You care to join me?  - Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

907
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,420
<46-5,MONTGOMERY>那咱们走吧
<46-5,MONTGOMERY>Then let's hit it.

908
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,770
<47-1,CASTLE>盖茨故意入狱逃避追捕的故事
<47-1,CASTLE>That story about Gates getting arrested,

909
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,960
<47-1,CASTLE>实际上是发生在你身上的  对吧
<47-1,CASTLE>that was your story, wasn't it?

910
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,380
<47-1,CASTLE>你害怕谋杀案会暴露
<47-1,CASTLE>You were afraid you were gonna get caught,

911
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,600
<47-1,CASTLE>于是就躲进了监狱
<47-1,CASTLE>so you hid in prison.

912
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,130
<47-2,JERRY>可惜你没早点发现
<47-2,JERRY>Too bad you didn't figure that out sooner.

913
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,360
<47-3,CASTLE>可惜你没早点跑掉
<47-3,CASTLE>Too bad you didn't leave sooner.

914
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,350
<47-3,CASTLE>警察随时都会到
<47-3,CASTLE>The cops will be here any minute.

915
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,060
<47-4,JERRY>看来莱恩探员在过来之前
<47-4,JERRY>Looks like detective Ryan called the precinct

916
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,100
<47-4,JERRY>已经打过电话给分局了
<47-4,JERRY>just before he got here.

917
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,300
<47-4,JERRY>短时间内不会有人找我的
<47-4,JERRY>There won't be anybody missing me for a while,

918
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,370
<47-4,JERRY>等他们想起我来  我早就消失了
<47-4,JERRY>and by the time they do, I'll be long gone.

919
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,620
<47-5,CASTLE>你跑不了多远的
<47-5,CASTLE>You won't get far.

920
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,480
<47-5,CASTLE>他们已经知道你的名字  你的长相
<47-5,CASTLE>They already have your name, know your face.

921
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,030
<47-6,JERRY>这些都可以改的  以前也干过
<47-6,JERRY>I'll change those. Done that before.

922
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
<47-6,JERRY>这也正是其中乐趣之一
<47-6,JERRY>That's part of the fun of it.

923
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,300
<47-7,CASTLE>像陷害盖茨一样好玩吗
<47-7,CASTLE>Fun like setting up Gates?

924
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,780
<47-8,JERRY>保罗·麦卡德是他在这个世界上
<47-8,JERRY>Paul Mccardle was the only person in the world

925
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,670
<47-8,JERRY>唯一在乎的一个人
<47-8,JERRY>that he cared about.

926
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,070
<47-8,JERRY>知道这点以后  剩下的就简单了
<47-8,JERRY>Once I learned that, the rest was easy.

927
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,570
<47-8,JERRY>说不准什么时候会用得上警徽呢
<47-8,JERRY>You never know when you'll need one of these.

928
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,940
<47-8,JERRY>再说盖茨喜欢监狱
<47-8,JERRY>Besides, Gates liked prison.

929
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,660
<47-9,CASTLE>你把盖茨该知道的都告诉了他
<47-9,CASTLE>You taught Gates everything he needed to know

930
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,030
<47-9,CASTLE>好让他帮你顶罪
<47-9,CASTLE>to take the fall for the triple killer murders.

931
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,440
<47-9,CASTLE>之后你只需要支付保罗的手术费
<47-9,CASTLE>After that, all you had to do was pay for Paul's surgery,

932
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,730
<47-9,CASTLE>就可以溜之大吉了
<47-9,CASTLE>and you could walk away scot-free.

933
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,810
<47-9,CASTLE>计划不错  就被这个大帆布袋给毁了
<47-9,CASTLE>That's a beautiful plan...undone by a duffel bag.

934
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,080
<47-10,JERRY>计划没毁  我还好端端地站在这呢
<47-10,JERRY>I'm not undone. I'm right here.

935
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,810
<47-10,JERRY>我会换个地方重新开始
<47-10,JERRY>I'll relocate. I'll start over.

936
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,080
<47-10,JERRY>看我从你眼前溜掉
<47-10,JERRY>It must eat you alive,

937
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,330
<47-10,JERRY>你却无能为力  一定很抓狂吧
<47-10,JERRY>knowing that you came so close to catching me.

938
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,210
<47-10,JERRY>但可惜  胜者为王  败者为寇
<47-10,JERRY>But this is a winner-take-all type of game.

939
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,780
<47-10,JERRY>杰瑞
<47-10,JERRY>Oh, Jerry.

940
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,720
<47-11,CASTLE>用枪吗
<47-11,CASTLE>Shooting?

941
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
<47-11,CASTLE>这不是你的风格
<47-11,CASTLE>It's not your style.

942
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,410
<47-12,JERRY>你还真是一点都不了解我呀
<47-12,JERRY>Oh, you really don't know me at all, do you?

943
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,660
<47-13,CASTLE>你并不难琢磨
<47-13,CASTLE>Oh, it's not complicated.

944
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,910
<47-13,CASTLE>你是被单亲母亲带大的
<47-13,CASTLE>You were raised by a single mother.

945
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:46,140
<47-13,CASTLE>她一头金发  很是漂亮
<47-13,CASTLE>She was blonde. Oh, she was beautiful.

946
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,050
<47-13,CASTLE>但是  她根本就不想要你
<47-13,CASTLE>But...she never wanted you.

947
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,260
<47-13,CASTLE>我猜当你在
<47-13,CASTLE>When you were, what,

948
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,560
<47-13,CASTLE>大概十二岁左右  她突然暴毙
<47-13,CASTLE>12 I'm guessing, she died suddenly.

949
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,020
<47-13,CASTLE>大概是嗑药过量
<47-13,CASTLE>Let's say drug overdose.

950
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,440
<47-13,CASTLE>你被送去寄养  可惜不是什么好人家
<47-13,CASTLE>You go into foster care, the bad kind.

951
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,640
<47-13,CASTLE>你如此地憎恨
<47-13,CASTLE>You have so much hate...

952
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,590
<47-13,CASTLE>憎恨你的母亲
<47-13,CASTLE>So much hate towards your mother

953
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
<47-13,CASTLE>因为她遗弃了你
<47-13,CASTLE>for abandoning you...

954
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,600
<47-13,CASTLE>所以你杀这些女人是为了报复她
<47-13,CASTLE>that you kill these women to get back at her.

955
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,490
<47-13,CASTLE>但是你把她们摆出一副安详的样子
<47-13,CASTLE>But you leave them looking peaceful,

956
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,250
<47-13,CASTLE>因为纵使你对你母亲有无比憎恨
<47-13,CASTLE>because as much as you hated your mother...

957
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,180
<47-13,CASTLE>你内心深处仍然爱她
<47-13,CASTLE>You loved your mother.

958
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,370
<47-13,CASTLE>我猜的差不多吧
<47-13,CASTLE>Am I getting warm?

959
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,660
<47-14,JERRY>你被死亡所吸引
<47-14,JERRY>You're drawn to death.

960
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,990
<47-14,JERRY>你喜欢接近死亡  因为这让你兴奋
<47-14,JERRY>You like to be around it 'cause it thrills you.

961
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,780
<47-14,JERRY>而这又是为什么呢
<47-14,JERRY>Now where does that come from?

962
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,340
<47-14,JERRY>你内心深处被压抑的冲动吗
<47-14,JERRY>Your own suppressed impulses?

963
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,000
<47-14,JERRY>你到底想
<47-14,JERRY>How close...

964
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,750
<47-14,JERRY>离死亡
<47-14,JERRY>To death...

965
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,770
<47-14,JERRY>有多近呢
<47-14,JERRY>Do you want to get?

967
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,790
<47-15,JERRY>别乱说话
<47-15,JERRY>Don't say anything you shouldn't.

968
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,210
<47-16,CASTLE>喂
<47-16,CASTLE>Hello.

969
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,040
<47-17,MARTHA>亲爱的  我只是想告诉你
<47-17,MARTHA>Darling, I just wanted you to know,

970
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,240
<47-17,MARTHA>你的阴谋论毫无根据
<47-17,MARTHA>your conspiracy theories are completely unfounded.

971
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,670
<47-18,CASTLE>我的阴谋论
<47-18,CASTLE>My conspiracy theories?

972
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,690
<47-18,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯的秘密仰慕者
<47-18,CASTLE>Alexis' secret admirer

973
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,720
<47-19,MARTHA>是艾什利  她男朋友
<47-19,MARTHA>is Ashley, her boyfriend.

974
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,280
<47-20,CASTLE>太好了  谢谢
<47-20,CASTLE>Oh, that's great. Thanks.

975
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,100
<47-21,MARTHA>他是个魅力四射的小伙子
<47-21,MARTHA>Yeah, and he's a very charming young man.

976
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,550
<47-21,MARTHA>总之不用担心  结局皆大欢喜
<47-21,MARTHA>So anyway, no need to worry. All's well that ends well.

977
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:22,950
<47-21,MARTHA>理查德
<47-21,MARTHA>Richard?

978
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,050
<47-22,CASTLE>我爱你
<47-22,CASTLE>I love you.

979
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,890
<47-23,JERRY>该说的都说完了
<47-23,JERRY>I don't think there's anything more to say.

980
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,880
<48-2,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -安全  他跑了
<48-2,CASTLE>- Castle?!  - Clear. He's gone.

981
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,470
<48-2,CASTLE>我没事  给莱恩叫辆救护车
<48-2,CASTLE>I'm fine. Ryan needs an ambulance.

982
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,220
<48-4,ESPOSITO>-用不着救护车  -到底发生什么事了
<48-4,ESPOSITO>- No, I don't.  - Hey, what the hell happened here?

983
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,320
<48-5,BECKETT>你没事我太高兴了
<48-5,BECKETT>I'm so glad that you're okay.

984
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,260
<48-6,CASTLE>他才是三重杀手  他安排盖茨冒名顶替
<48-6,CASTLE>He's the triple killer. He set Gates up to be a copycat.

985
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,210
<48-7,BECKETT>我知道  当你跟莱恩来找杰瑞
<48-7,BECKETT>I know. I did the math when you and Ryan

986
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,490
<48-7,BECKETT>却一直没回去  我就在琢磨这件事了
<48-7,BECKETT>didn't come back from talking to Jerry.

987
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,160
<48-8,CASTLE>你怎么知道要到这来找我们
<48-8,CASTLE>How did you know to come here?

988
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,500
<48-9,BECKETT>你妈打了个电话给我
<48-9,BECKETT>Your mom called.

989
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,140
<48-9,BECKETT>她说你跟她说你爱她
<48-9,BECKETT>She said that you told her that you loved her,

990
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,420
<48-9,BECKETT>她就知道肯定大事不妙了
<48-9,BECKETT>and she figured something must be terribly wrong.

991
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,290
<48-10,CASTLE>我就知道她会明白的
<48-10,CASTLE>I figured she might.

992
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,120
<48-10,CASTLE>干得好
<48-10,CASTLE>Good girl.

993
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,390
<49-1,BECKETT>给
<49-1,BECKETT>Here you go.

994
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:57,980
<49-2,CASTLE>谢谢
<49-2,CASTLE>Thanks.

995
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:03,900
<49-3,BECKETT>跟我说说  卡塞尔
<49-3,BECKETT>Tell me something, Castle.

996
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,400
<49-3,BECKETT>他为什么留你活口
<49-3,BECKETT>Why did he let you live?

997
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,250
<49-4,CASTLE>为了惩罚我
<49-4,CASTLE>To punish me.

998
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,750
<49-4,CASTLE>让我为毁了他的计划而付出代价
<49-4,CASTLE>To make me pay for ruining his plan.

999
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,530
<49-4,CASTLE>现在他又要开始杀戮了
<49-4,CASTLE>Now he's gonna kill again,

1000
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,790
<49-4,CASTLE>就因为我没能阻止他
<49-4,CASTLE>all because I couldn't stop him.

1001
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,340
<49-4,CASTLE>而我觉得如此
<49-4,CASTLE>And I feel so...

1002
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,460
<49-5,BECKETT>我了解你的感受
<49-5,BECKETT>I know the feeling.

1003
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,490
<49-6,CASTLE>我知道你了解
<49-6,CASTLE>I know you do.
