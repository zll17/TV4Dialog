<1-13,CASTLE>That's the point.

39
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,570
<1-13,CASTLE>这是块糖心蛋饼
<1-13,CASTLE>It's a s'morelet.

46
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,610
<1-16,CASTLE>大卫·哈塞尔霍夫
<1-16,CASTLE>"海滩救护队"主演

47
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,610
<1-16,CASTLE>就像大卫·哈塞尔霍夫
<1-16,CASTLE>it's kinda like David Hasselhoff.

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,610
<1-16,CASTLE>开始你很反感  但是之后很奇怪的
<1-16,CASTLE>At first you're repulsed, but then strangely,

49
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,560
<1-16,CASTLE>你就喜欢上了

51
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,160
<1-18,CASTLE>真不知道阿丽克西斯是怎么了
<1-18,CASTLE>Wonder what's up with Alexis?

52
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,160
<1-18,CASTLE>她看上去有点心不在焉的
<1-18,CASTLE>She seems a little out of it.

53
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,310
<1-19,MARTHA>多明显啊
<1-19,MARTHA>Isn't it obvious?

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,410
<1-20,CASTLE>-怎么了  -她恋爱了
<1-20,CASTLE>- What? - Oh, she's in love.

<1-22,CASTLE>-阿丽克西斯吗  -当然了  亲爱的
<1-22,CASTLE>- Alexis? - Oh, come on, darling.

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,860
<1-23,MARTHA>你不会还没意识到吧
<1-23,MARTHA>In case you haven't noticed,

57
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,240
<1-23,MARTHA>她已经不是个小女孩儿了
<1-23,MARTHA>she's not a little girl anymore.

58
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,180
<1-24,CASTLE>谢谢您提醒了  老妈
<1-24,CASTLE>Thank you, mother.

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,690
<1-24,CASTLE>我觉得阿丽克西斯要是恋爱了
<1-24,CASTLE>I think if Alexis were in love,

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,310
<1-25,MARTHA>-肯定会告诉我的  -那可不一定
<1-25,MARTHA>- she would've told me. - Ah, ah, ah, ah.

61
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,410
<1-25,MARTHA>她没告诉你就证明她恋爱了
<1-25,MARTHA>The fact that she hasn't told you is how we know it's real.

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,620
<1-26,CASTLE>老妈
<1-26,CASTLE>Mother.

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,900
<1-27,MARTHA>其实昨天晚上她已经告诉我了
<1-27,MARTHA>Okay, and the fact that she... mentioned it to me last night.

64
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,280
<1-28,CASTLE>这个男孩子是谁  在哪认识的
<1-28,CASTLE>Who is he? W-where did she meet him?

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,260
<1-29,MARTHA>我不知道  她不肯说
<1-29,MARTHA>I don't know. She wouldn't say.

66
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,250
<1-29,MARTHA>我发誓  她什么也没告诉我
<1-29,MARTHA>No, diva's honor. She didn't tell me anything.

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,130
<1-29,MARTHA>连名字也没说
<1-29,MARTHA>She didn't even tell me his name.

68
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,820
<1-30,CASTLE>真不敢相信她连你都告诉了却没告诉我
<1-30,CASTLE>I can't believe she told you and not me.

69
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,750
<1-30,CASTLE>我才应该是她的"倾诉伙伴"
<1-30,CASTLE>I'm supposed to be her go-to guy.

70
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,220
<1-31,MARTHA>亲爱的  你当然是
<1-31,MARTHA>Oh, darling, of course you are.

71
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,140
<1-31,MARTHA>但是  你知道的  这是初恋
<1-31,MARTHA>It's just, you know, it's first love.

72
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,230
<1-31,MARTHA>很神奇  很难以捉摸
<1-31,MARTHA>It's magical, ethereal.

73
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,500
<1-31,MARTHA>不能以常理来判断的
<1-31,MARTHA>It defies logic.

74
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,370
<1-32,MARTHA>理查德  你电话
<1-32,MARTHA>Richard, your phone?

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,540
<1-33,CASTLE>奥  是贝克特
<1-33,CASTLE>Oh, Beckett.

77
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,470
<1-34,MARTHA>可能又有迷离谋杀案了  亲爱的
<1-34,MARTHA>Maybe it's a nice murder, darling.

78
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,430
<1-34,MARTHA>你今天又有事情可做了
<1-34,MARTHA>Brighten your day.

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,540
<1-35,MARTHA>好孩子
<1-35,MARTHA>Good boy.

80
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,500
<1-36,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<1-36,CASTLE>Castle.

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,150
<2-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯刚开始学走路的时候
<2-1,CASTLE>When Alexis took her first steps,

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,390
<2-1,CASTLE>我扶着她怕她摔倒
<2-1,CASTLE>I was there to catch her when she fell.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,860
<2-1,CASTLE>她第一次学骑没有练习轮子的自行车
<2-1,CASTLE>The first time she rode her bike without training wheels,

84
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,670
<2-1,CASTLE>也是我像疯子似的
<2-1,CASTLE>I was the maniac

85
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,700
<2-1,CASTLE>在后面跟着她在大街上跑
<2-1,CASTLE>chasing her down the street

86
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,700
<2-1,CASTLE>大喊着让她不要撞到
<2-1,CASTLE>screaming for her to watch out

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,180
<2-1,CASTLE>拄拐棍的老太太
<2-1,CASTLE>for the old lady with the walker.

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
<2-1,CASTLE>甚至她刚学会说话的时候
<2-1,CASTLE>Even her first word--

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
<2-2,BECKETT>我猜猜  学会的是叫爸爸
<2-2,BECKETT>Let me guess. "Daddy"?

90
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,720
<2-3,CASTLE>-不是  是"结局"  -奥
<2-3,CASTLE>- No, it was "Denouement." - Oh.

91
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,270
<2-3,CASTLE>从幼儿抓起  我就给她强调
<2-3,CASTLE>I stressed story structure

92
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,250
<2-3,CASTLE>-故事结构的重要性  -是吗
<2-3,CASTLE>- from an early age. - Uh-huh.

93
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,260
<2-3,CASTLE>不管怎么说  我担心以后
<2-3,CASTLE>Anyway, I'm afraid that

94
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,240
<2-3,CASTLE>我们之间的那种特殊的情感
<2-3,CASTLE>this is the beginning of the end

95
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,110
<2-3,CASTLE>会就此消失了
<2-3,CASTLE>of our special thing.

96
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,500
<2-4,BECKETT>你知道吗  我可不担心  卡塞尔
<2-4,BECKETT>Well, you know, I wouldn't worry, Castle.

97
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,510
<2-4,BECKETT>我看到过她看你的那种眼神
<2-4,BECKETT>I mean, I've seen the way that she looks at you.

98
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,300
<2-4,BECKETT>你的真正问题是
<2-4,BECKETT>Your real problem is

99
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,680
<2-4,BECKETT>特别崇拜自己父亲的女孩子
<2-4,BECKETT>that girls who adore their daddies

100
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,660
<2-4,BECKETT>通常会嫁个一个和自己父亲很像的人
<2-4,BECKETT>usually end up marrying guys just like them.

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,990
<2-6,BECKETT>-是吗  -帕里什医生
<2-6,BECKETT>- They do? - Dr. Parish.

<2-7,LANIE>你们还没来我就开始干活了
<2-7,LANIE>I'm here before you doing all the work.

<2-8,CASTLE>我这还有剩下的
<2-8,CASTLE>You can have the rest of mine.

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,920
<2-9,LANIE>其实  我不喝咖啡
<2-9,LANIE>Actually, I don't drink coffee.

108
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,030
<2-9,LANIE>可是给我带块熊掌糕能要你命啊
<2-9,LANIE>But would it kill you to bring me a bear claw?

109
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,860
<2-10,BECKETT>说到要命
<2-10,BECKETT>Speaking of killing.

110
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,730
<2-11,LANIE>胸部中一枪
<2-11,LANIE>Single G.S.W. to the chest,

111
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,300
<2-11,LANIE>大枪口径  大约45毫米
<2-11,LANIE>large caliber, probably a .45.

112
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,670
<2-11,LANIE>尸斑显示死亡时间大概是半夜
<2-11,LANIE>Lividity suggests time of death around midnight.

113
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,440
<2-11,LANIE>嘿
<2-11,LANIE>Hey.

114
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,520
<2-12,CASTLE>我也有条那样的拳击短裤
<2-12,CASTLE>I have those boxers.

115
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,710
<2-12,CASTLE>托马斯·纳什的
<2-12,CASTLE>Thomas Nash.

116
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,670
<2-12,CASTLE>英国非常贵的一个牌子
<2-12,CASTLE>Very pricey British brand.

117
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,070
<2-12,CASTLE>非常的柔软  是丝绸的
<2-12,CASTLE>Amazingly soft. They're silk.

118
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,420
<2-13,CASTLE>我只是说  他被打死的时候
<2-13,CASTLE>I'm just saying, he was probably very comfortable

119
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,520
<2-13,CASTLE>应该挺舒服的
<2-13,CASTLE>when he was shot and killed.

120
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,720
<2-14,BECKETT>深更半夜的他几乎裸着
<2-14,BECKETT>So what was this guy doing out here

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,930
<2-14,BECKETT>在这儿是做什么呢
<2-14,BECKETT>practically naked at midnight?

122
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,330
<2-15,LANIE>卡塞尔  少提你那些谬论了
<2-15,LANIE>Don't bother with any of your perverted theories, Castle.

123
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,240
<2-15,LANIE>我在伤口弹孔里找到了衣物纤维
<2-15,LANIE>I found fibers in the bullet hole.

124
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,630
<2-16,BECKETT>也就是说他死时
<2-16,BECKETT>Which means he was wearing clothes

125
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,680
<2-16,BECKETT>-是穿着衣服的  -这说不通啊
<2-16,BECKETT>- when he was shot. - That doesn't make any sense.

126
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,330
<2-17,CASTLE>凶手杀了人
<2-17,CASTLE>The killer shot him

127
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,260
<2-17,CASTLE>又把血淋淋得衣服脱下来
<2-17,CASTLE>and then hung around to take his bloody clothes off him?

128
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,960
<2-18,BECKETT>可能凶手是担心衣服上会留下
<2-18,BECKETT>Well, maybe the killer was worried that there was

129
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,100
<2-18,BECKETT>暴露自己和死者关系的法医证据
<2-18,BECKETT>forensic evidence on the clothes that would connect them.

130
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,120
<2-19,JAVIER ESPOSITO>警员在第五大街附近的垃圾桶里
<2-19,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo. Uni found this wallet

131
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,190
<2-19,JAVIER ESPOSITO>找到了这个钱包
<2-19,JAVIER ESPOSITO>out in a garbage can near fifth.

133

179
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,110

191
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,460
<4-1,BECKETT>你打断过N个人的肋骨
<4-1,BECKETT>You inflicted dozens of broken bones,

192
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
<4-1,BECKETT>把其中一个人眼睛挖了出来
<4-1,BECKETT>gouged out one of your victim's eyes,

193
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,270
<4-1,BECKETT>还咬掉过别人的耳朵
<4-1,BECKETT>bit off part of an ear of another one.

194
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,130
<4-1,BECKETT>看起来你这种人不犯罪才不正常呢
<4-1,BECKETT>Sounds like committing murder was inevitable.

195
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,190
<4-1,BECKETT>我只是很好奇
<4-1,BECKETT>I'm just curious.

196
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,770
<4-1,BECKETT>你为什么要拿走死者的衣服
<4-1,BECKETT>Why did you take his clothes?

197
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,410
<4-2,BECKETT>不是我拿的
<4-2,BECKETT>Wasn't me.

198
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,410
<4-2,BECKETT>那为什么死者的钱包上
<4-2,BECKETT>Well, then why were your fingerprints

199
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,350
<4-2,BECKETT>有你的指纹
<4-2,BECKETT>on a dead man's wallet?

200
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,840
<4-2,BECKETT>别告诉我他刚好掉了钱包
<4-2,BECKETT>Did he just happen to drop it,

201
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,780
<4-2,BECKETT>你就好心的捡起来还给了他
<4-2,BECKETT>and you politely picked it up for him?

202
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,810
<4-2,BECKETT>为什么我的手下在你的住所
<4-2,BECKETT>And why did my detectives find

203
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,120
<4-2,BECKETT>找到了这把45口径的没注册的手枪
<4-2,BECKETT>this unregistered 45 in your apartment,

204
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,050
<4-2,BECKETT>这把手枪又这么巧
<4-2,BECKETT>which just happens to match

205
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,820
<4-2,BECKETT>和死者伤口的枪口直径大小一致
<4-2,BECKETT>the size of the bullet hole in my victim?

206
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,740
<4-4,BECKETT>-嘿  -你要是清白的
<4-4,BECKETT>- Hey. - If you're so innocent,

207
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,640
<4-4,BECKETT>唐瑞德先生
<4-4,BECKETT>Mr. D'andrad,

208
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,110
<4-4,BECKETT>你为什么拒捕
<4-4,BECKETT>why did you resist arrest

209
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,890
<4-4,BECKETT>还把我一个手下的头往墙上撞
<4-4,BECKETT>and try to put one of my detectives through a wall?

210
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
<5-1,RYAN>兄弟  你知道  穿个合适的高领绒衣
<5-1,RYAN>You know, the right turtleneck,

211
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,570
<5-1,RYAN>别人也看不出来
<5-1,RYAN>and no one is even gonna notice, bro.

212
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,480
<5-2,RYAN>或者围条围巾
<5-2,RYAN>Maybe a scarf.

213
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,300
<5-2,RYAN>你干脆说实话吧
<5-2,RYAN>Why don't you just confess to the truth?

214
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,770
<6-1,BECKETT>反正迟早你也要招供的
<6-1,BECKETT>It's gonna come out sooner or later.

215
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,060
<6-1,BECKETT>我看见的时候他已经死了
<6-1,BECKETT>He was already dead.

216
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,110
<6-2,BECKETT>钱包就那么碰巧放在他的旁边吗
<6-2,BECKETT>With a wallet lying conveniently next to him?

217
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,450
<6-3,CASTLE>听着  如果你不想承认你的罪行
<6-3,CASTLE>Uh, look, if you're not going to admit to it,

218
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,360
<6-3,CASTLE>至少也要编个像样点的故事
<6-3,CASTLE>you might at least want to try coming up with a story

219
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,570
<6-3,CASTLE>-出来啊  -我说的是实话
<6-3,CASTLE>- that's a little more convincing. - It's what happened!

220
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,900
<7-1,CASTLE>难道你没害怕吗
<7-1,CASTLE>Like you weren't scared.

221
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,150
<7-2,ESPOSITO>这家伙应该关起来  贝克特
<7-2,ESPOSITO>I want this guy to fry, Beckett.

222
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,240
<7-3,BECKETT>他会的
<7-3,BECKETT>Oh, he will,

223
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,740
<7-3,BECKETT>只要蕾妮能确定子弹口径是点45
<7-3,BECKETT>as soon as Lanie confirms that that bullet is a .45.

224
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,010
<8-3,LANIE>-不是点45  -你确定吗
<8-3,LANIE>- It's not a .45. - Are you sure?

225
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,140
<8-4,CASTLE>-很确定  -点38
<8-4,CASTLE>- I'm positive. - .38?

226
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,510
<8-5,LANIE>不是  也不是点44或是点357
<8-5,LANIE>Nope. It's not a .44 or a .357

227
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,730
<8-5,LANIE>也不是点22或是9毫米口径
<8-5,LANIE>or a .22 or a 9 millimeter

228
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,730
<8-5,LANIE>是一种我根本就没见过的子弹
<8-5,LANIE>or any other kind of bullet I've ever seen.

229
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,290
<8-6,CASTLE>这么说就是一种新型子弹咯
<8-6,CASTLE>So it's a new kind of bullet.

230
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,080
<8-7,LANIE>不是  一点都不新  看看吧
<8-7,LANIE>Oh, no. Not new at all. Check it out.

231
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,190
<8-9,LANIE>- 是圆形子弹  - 你看到那种白色的外壳了吗
<8-9,LANIE>- Oh, it's round. - You see that white coating?

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
<8-10,BECKETT>看见了  那是什么  氧化物吗
<8-10,BECKETT>Yeah. What is it, oxidation?

233
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,360
<8-11,LANIE>- 准确的说是氧化铅  -锈吗
<8-11,LANIE>- Lead oxide, to be exact. - Rust?

234
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,530
<8-12,CASTLE>是的  根据氧化铅的含量
<8-12,CASTLE>Yep. Based on the amount of it,

235
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,700
<8-13,LANIE>我判断那子弹有200年的历史
<8-13,LANIE>I'd say that bullet is 200 years old.

236
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,450
<8-14,CASTLE>一颗有200年历史子弹只可能意味着一件事
<8-14,CASTLE>A 200-year-old bullet can only mean one thing.

237
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,880
<8-14,CASTLE>一位时间旅行的凶手
<8-14,CASTLE>Time-traveling killer.

238
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,590
<9-1,CASTLE>因此  凶手可能是通过时间涟漪
<9-1,CASTLE>Ergo, the killer could've entered present time

239
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,600
<9-1,CASTLE>来到我们这个时代  杀掉古德斯坦
<9-1,CASTLE>through a time ripple, killed Goldstein,

240
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,940
<9-1,CASTLE>再通过时间涟漪返回
<9-1,CASTLE>and then gone back through the time ripple,

241
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,650
<9-1,CASTLE>也就是说我们要找到那个时间涟漪
<9-1,CASTLE>which means we just have to find the time ripple.

242
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,850
<9-2,BECKETT>求你别再提"时间涟漪"了
<9-2,BECKETT>Could you please stop saying "Time ripple"?

243
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,250
<9-3,CASTLE>好吧  听起来有点下流  是不是
<9-3,CASTLE>Yeah. It sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?

244
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,720
<9-3,CASTLE>要是那个时间涟漪关闭了呢
<9-3,CASTLE>What if the ripple closed?

245
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,910
<9-3,CASTLE>时间机器
<9-3,CASTLE>Time machine.

246
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,210
<9-3,CASTLE>-我们需要一座时间机器  -当下
<9-3,CASTLE>- We need a time machine. - Well, in this century,

247
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,940
<9-4,BECKETT>我们还没有排除大块头唐瑞德的嫌疑
<9-4,BECKETT>we still haven't ruled out our big buddy Mr. D'andrad.

248
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,360
<9-5,CASTLE>是啊  不过他看起来不像是会时间旅行那种人
<9-5,CASTLE>Yeah, he just doesn't seem like the time-travel type to me.

249
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,090
<9-6,RYAN>凶手一定不是时间旅行者
<9-6,RYAN>Can't be a time-traveling killer.

250
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,230
<9-6,RYAN>那子弹有200年的历史呢
<9-6,RYAN>Bullet had 200 years of rust on it.

251
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,590
<9-6,RYAN>如果凶手是时间旅行者
<9-6,RYAN>If the killer had been a time traveler,

252
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,360
<9-6,RYAN>子弹应该是新的
<9-6,RYAN>the bullet would've been brand-new.

253
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,760
<9-7,CASTLE>除非时间旅行也能造成生锈
<9-7,CASTLE>Unless time travel causes rust.

254
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,170
<9-8,BECKETT>我看你是脑袋生锈了  你询问
<9-8,BECKETT>On your brain. Have you followed up

255
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,240
<9-8,BECKETT>死者的姐姐有关古董子弹的事情了吗
<9-8,BECKETT>with the victim's sister regarding the antique bullet?

256
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,650
<9-9,RYAN>问了  她不知道古董子弹和古董枪的事
<9-9,RYAN>Yep. She has no clue about antique bullets or guns,

257
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,490
<9-9,RYAN>但是有人对那些很了解
<9-9,RYAN>But there's somebody who does.

258
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,730
<9-9,RYAN>阿贝·桑维奇  你要找的古董武器专家
<9-9,RYAN>Abe Sandrich--antique weapons expert you requested.

260
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,130
<9-10,CASTLE>这名字让我感觉很饿
<9-10,CASTLE>That reminds me, I'm starving.

261
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,020
<10-1,ABE>我喜欢点45
<10-1,ABE>I like .45s.

262
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,670
<10-1,ABE>找到好的角度
<10-1,ABE>Catch the right angle,

263
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,320
<10-1,ABE>这家伙能把你的脑袋轰下来
<10-1,ABE>this sucker could take your head clean off.

264
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,510
<10-1,ABE>但是
<10-1,ABE>But...

265
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,450
<10-1,ABE>这把不是你要找的枪
<10-1,ABE>It's not the gun you're looking for.

266
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,950
<10-3,ABE>-为什么  -枪管必须重新组装
<10-3,ABE>- Why is that? - Barrel would've had to be modified.

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,690
<10-3,ABE>这把还跟出厂时一模一样
<10-3,ABE>This one's factory fresh.

268
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,790
<10-4,CASTLE>你觉得"巨人"唐瑞德说他在草地上
<10-4,CASTLE>Well, do you think D'andrad the giant was telling the truth

269
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,140
<10-4,CASTLE>找到钱包  说的是真话吗
<10-4,CASTLE>when he said he found the wallet in the grass?

270
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,610
<10-5,BECKETT>凶手的确是拿走了古德斯坦的衣服
<10-5,BECKETT>Well, the killer did take Goldstein's clothes,

271
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,840
<10-5,BECKETT>所以说在凶手离开犯罪现场的时候
<10-5,BECKETT>so it's possible that the wallet might have fallen out

272
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,240
<10-5,BECKETT>钱包有可能掉出来了
<10-5,BECKETT>when he left the crime scene.

273
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,660
<10-5,BECKETT>什么样的武器能发射这种子弹
<10-5,BECKETT>What kind of a pistol would've fired that bullet?

274
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,990
<10-6,ABE>通常我们管这个叫铅弹  原因显而易见
<10-6,ABE>We usually just call 'em lead balls for, uh, obvious reasons.

275
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,140
<10-6,ABE>很多18世纪的燧发枪都可以发射这种子弹
<10-6,ABE>I'd say a whole lot of 18th century flintlocks--

276
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,000
<10-6,ABE>但是枪种过多  无从推测
<10-6,ABE>too many brands to even speculate.

277
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,780
<10-6,ABE>你要找到那把枪
<10-6,ABE>You'll need to find the actual pistol

278
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,400
<10-6,ABE>才能有办法和这枚铅弹比对
<10-6,ABE>to match it this lead ball.

279
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,250
<10-7,BECKETT>有多少人
<10-7,BECKETT>And how many people

280
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,880
<10-7,BECKETT>有这种类型的古董枪呢
<10-7,BECKETT>would own that kind of antique pistol?

281
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,870
<10-8,ABE>很难讲
<10-8,ABE>It's hard to say.

282
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,350
<10-8,ABE>它们都被当做是收藏品
<10-8,ABE>They're considered collectibles,

283
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,800
<10-8,ABE>所以也就不用注册
<10-8,ABE>so they don't have to be registered.

284
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,660
<10-9,CASTLE>用它来杀人是聪明的选择
<10-9,CASTLE>Making it pretty smart to kill someone with one.

285
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,930
<10-10,ABE>那是当然  枪的年头可能有些久
<10-10,ABE>Oh, yeah. The guns may be old,

286
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,860
<10-10,ABE>但是其杀意可是丝毫不减
<10-10,ABE>but, uh, they got plenty of killing left in 'em.

287
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,850
<11-1,ESPOSITO>唐瑞德是凶手吗
<11-1,ESPOSITO>So is, uh, D'andrad our guy?

288
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,310
<11-3,ESPOSITO>-不是  -那他干嘛非要拒捕  害我受伤
<11-3,ESPOSITO>- I'm afraid not. - W-why did he go all Hulk Hogan on me?

289
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,150
<11-4,CASTLE>蝎子为什么要刺青蛙呢  那是他的本性
<11-4,CASTLE>Well, why did the scorpion sting the frog? It's his nature.

290
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,770
<11-5,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>唐瑞德只能在监狱
<11-5,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>Yeah, well, D'andrad will be seeing nature

291
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,240
<11-5,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>当蝎子了  他可是袭警了
<11-5,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>from behind bars from now on for assaulting an officer.

292
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,050
<11-5,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>我会争取给他上限惩罚的  警探
<11-5,CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY>I'll see he gets the max, detective.

293
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,680
<11-6,ESPOSITO>谢谢  队长
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Thank you, Captain.

294
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,450
<11-7,MONTGOMERY>你可以休几天假的
<11-7,MONTGOMERY>You can take a couple days if you like,

295
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,920
<11-8,CASTLE>-看点电影  -读读《赤裸热浪》
<11-8,CASTLE>- catch some movies. - Read "Naked Heat."

296
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,700
<11-9,ESPOSITO>不  不用了  长官
<11-9,ESPOSITO>No. No need, sir.

297
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,590
<11-10,RYAN>还是没找到死者衣服
<11-10,RYAN>Still no luck with the clothes.

298
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,850
<11-10,RYAN>警队搜寻了公园以外
<11-10,RYAN>Units looked in every garbage can

299
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,410
<11-10,RYAN>5个街区范围内的垃圾桶
<11-10,RYAN>within 5-block radius of the park.

300
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,990
<11-11,BECKETT>到底因为什么  凶手非要拿走
<11-11,BECKETT>What is so special about these clothes

301
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,380
<11-11,BECKETT>死者的衣服呢
<11-11,BECKETT>that our killer would take them?

302
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,950
<11-12,CASTLE>也许凶手时间旅行来了之后  是光着身子的
<11-12,CASTLE>Maybe the killer came through the time ripple naked

303
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,780
<11-12,CASTLE>需要死者的衣服
<11-12,CASTLE>and needed the clothes...

304
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,480
<11-12,CASTLE>就跟《终结者》情节一样
<11-12,CASTLE>Like in "The Terminator."

305
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,700
<11-13,BECKETT>很遗憾  目前我也没什么更好的推断
<11-13,BECKETT>Sadly, I don't have a better theory at this point.

306
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,340
<11-13,BECKETT>问题在于
<11-13,BECKETT>So the question is,

307
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,990
<11-14,BECKETT>一个像古德斯坦这样的华尔街数据处理员
<11-14,BECKETT>What did a wall street number cruncher like Goldstein

308
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,360
<11-14,BECKETT>到底惹上了什么麻烦
<11-14,BECKETT>get himself into?

309
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
<11-14,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去他的公司调查一下
<11-14,BECKETT>Castle and I will go to his firm.

310
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,770
<11-14,BECKETT>你们查查相关社会媒体
<11-14,BECKETT>You guys see if you can track down

311
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,630
<11-14,BECKETT>和当地俱乐部
<11-14,BECKETT>any antique gun enthusiasts

312
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,530
<11-14,BECKETT>能不能找到古董枪的线索
<11-14,BECKETT>on social media sites or local clubs.

313
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,680
<11-14,BECKETT>也许能找到和古德斯坦生活有交集的人
<11-14,BECKETT>Maybe someone from Goldstein's life will pop.

314
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:50,940
<11-15,RYAN>好的
<11-15,RYAN>You got it.

315
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,660
<11-16,BECKETT>我就是想不通
<11-16,BECKETT>You know, I just don't get

316
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,800
<11-16,BECKETT>为什么凶手会射杀古德斯坦  偷他的衣服
<11-16,BECKETT>how someone could shoot Goldstein, steal his clothes,

317
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,970
<11-16,BECKETT>却偏偏留下了他的钱包
<11-16,BECKETT>and then not hang on to his wallet.

318
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,290
<11-16,BECKETT>不符合常理啊
<11-16,BECKETT>It just doesn't make any sense.

319
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,230
<11-17,CASTLE>是啊
<11-17,CASTLE>No.

320
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,210
<11-18,BECKETT>也许是巨蛾杀了他  把他的衣服吃掉了
<11-18,BECKETT>Maybe giant moths killed him and then ate his clothes.

321
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,490
<11-19,CASTLE>有可能
<11-19,CASTLE>Could be.

322
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
<11-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<11-20,BECKETT>Hey, Castle.

323
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,140
<11-20,BECKETT>如果这个案子你不感兴趣
<11-20,BECKETT>If this case is boring for you,

324
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,970
<11-20,BECKETT>你可以回家玩去
<11-20,BECKETT>you don't have to stay.

325
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,970
<11-21,CASTLE>没有  我在看我的邮箱
<11-21,CASTLE>No, I-I'm just checking

326
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,840
<11-21,CASTLE>短信  看看阿丽克西斯有没有打给我
<11-21,CASTLE>my e-mails, my texts, see if Alexis called.

327
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,810
<11-21,CASTLE>我不敢相信她竟然告诉我妈说她恋爱了
<11-21,CASTLE>I can't believe she told my mother she's in love

328
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,580
<11-21,CASTLE>-却没告诉我  -这样啊
<11-21,CASTLE>- and is holding out on me. - Oh.

329
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,240
<11-23,CASTLE>-我打给她  -别  你要等她告诉你
<11-23,CASTLE>- I'm gonna call her. - No, no. You have to let her tell you

330
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,490
<11-24,BECKETT>给她时间  等她准备好
<11-24,BECKETT>in her own time, when she's ready.

331
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,010
<11-25,CASTLE>我是超酷老爸  她还要准备什么
<11-25,CASTLE>I'm the cool dad. Why can't she be ready?

332
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,460
<11-25,CASTLE>听我说
<11-25,CASTLE>Listen to me.

333
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,740
<11-26,BECKETT>我小时候  我老爸也是这么干的
<11-26,BECKETT>My dad tried to do the same thing when I was her age,

334
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,850
<11-26,BECKETT>结果我和车库摇滚歌手约会了7个月
<11-26,BECKETT>and I ended up dating a grunge rocker who smelled like

335
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,580
<11-26,BECKETT>他身上的味道就像湿的法兰绒和丁香香烟
<11-26,BECKETT>wet flannel and clove cigarettes for seven months.

336
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,620
<11-26,BECKETT>你可不要招惹青春期的少女
<11-26,BECKETT>You do not mess with a teenage girl and her hormones.

337
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,930
<11-26,BECKETT>你说得对
<11-26,BECKETT>You're right.

338
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,490
<11-27,CASTLE>我不会给她打电话的
<11-27,CASTLE>I won't call her.

339
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,860
<11-27,CASTLE>-你刚刚说巨蛾了是吗  -没有
<11-27,CASTLE>- Did you say something about a giant moth? - Nope.

340
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,260
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>穿着内裤被发现了
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>In his underwear?

341
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,910
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>丹尼为我工作两年了
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>Danny is working for me for two years.

342
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,500
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>我不知道他去公园干什么
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>But I just don't know what he'd have been up to in the park.

343
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,500
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>他不是那种喜欢户外运动的人
<12-1,ADAM MURPHY>He wasn't exactly the outdoors type.

344
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,150
<12-2,BECKETT>那古董枪呢  墨菲先生
<12-2,BECKETT>What about antique guns, Mr. Murphy?

345
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,360
<12-2,BECKETT>你知道这方面的事情吗
<12-2,BECKETT>Do you know anything about them?

346
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,890
<12-3,ADAM>古董  不不  他也不喜欢枪什么的
<12-3,ADAM>Antiques? No. No, he wasn't into guns at all.

347
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,430
<12-4,BECKETT>据我了解  他很晚下班
<12-4,BECKETT>Well, I understand that he worked long hours.

348
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,280
<12-4,BECKETT>昨晚他什么时候离开的
<12-4,BECKETT>Do you know when he left last night?

349
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
<12-5,ADAM>大概在晚上九点半
<12-5,ADAM>Uh, yeah, right around 9:30.

350
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
<12-6,CASTLE>让我来帮帮你
<12-6,CASTLE>Oh, hey. Let me help you with that.

<12-7,JULIA>Thanks. This is Julia Foster, Danny's assistant.

<12-8,ADAM>这两位是贝克特探长和理查德·卡塞尔
<12-8,ADAM>This is Detective Beckett and Richard Castle.

353
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,670
<12-9,CASTLE>-你好  -你好
<12-9,CASTLE>- Hi. - Hi.

354
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,080
<12-11,CASTLE>古德斯坦昨晚离开的时候你也在场啊
<12-11,CASTLE>Were you here last night when Goldstein left?

355
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,070
<12-12,JULIA>-当然  -知道他去哪了吗
<12-12,JULIA>- Of course. - Any idea where he was heading?

356
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,970
<12-14,JULIA>不知道  他只是道了晚安
<12-14,JULIA>No, he just said good night.

357
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,480
<12-15,BECKETT>白天的时候呢
<12-15,BECKETT>And what about during the day,

358
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,570
<12-15,BECKETT>有什么反常的行为吗
<12-15,BECKETT>was there anything out of the ordinary,

359
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,000
<12-15,BECKETT>或是奇怪的电话吗
<12-15,BECKETT>any strange phone calls?

360
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,190
<12-16,JULIA>没有  不过是那些愤怒的投资者  不过
<12-16,JULIA>No, just the usual unhappy investor. Although...

361
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,700
<12-17,CASTLE>不过什么
<12-17,CASTLE>Although what?

<12-22,ADAM>就是一种冒险
<12-22,ADAM>A really big bet that

368
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,350
<12-22,ADAM>汇率能够回到原来的样子
<12-22,ADAM>prices would return to historical norms.

<12-28,ADAM>我们接到了
<12-28,ADAM>We fielded scores

<12-28,ADAM>客户几份比较"生动"的语音留言
<12-28,ADAM>of less-than-complimentary messages from clients.

375
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,080
<12-29,JULIA>简直是气得脸红脖子粗
<12-29,JULIA>More like apoplectic,

376
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,430
<12-29,JULIA>他们都埋怨丹尼
<12-29,JULIA>and a lot of them blamed Danny.

377
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,680
<12-30,BECKETT>好吧  我们需要语音留言的副本
<12-30,BECKETT>All right, well, I'll need a copy of all of these messages

380
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,920
<13-1,MONTGOMERY>和古德斯坦赔钱的基金客户有交集吗
<13-1,MONTGOMERY>to investors in Goldstein's failed fund, detectives?

381

<13-2,RYAN>没有  目前为止就在社区媒体网站上
<13-2,RYAN>Nah. So far I've seen a lot of cool, old guns

382
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,130
<13-2,RYAN>看到一些古董枪收藏者的很酷的古董枪
<13-2,RYAN>on these social media sites for antique gun lovers,

383
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,620
<13-2,RYAN>但是没人和古德斯坦有关联
<13-2,RYAN>But none of the owners pop in Goldstein's life.

384
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,330

389
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,270
<13-4,ESPOSITO>那个时候  枪更讲究其艺术性
<13-4,ESPOSITO>See, back then, they were into the artistry of it all.

390

<13-6,ESPOSITO>they all lost more than a million bucks apiece.

393
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,020
<13-6,ESPOSITO>一百万
<13-6,ESPOSITO>$1 million?

394
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,830
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>如果我有那么多钱
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>If I had that kind of scratch,

395
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,220
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>我会找个安全点的地方藏起来
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>I'd put it in something safe,

396
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,420
<13-8,RYAN>-比如说我的床垫里  -看看这个
<13-8,RYAN>- like my mattress. - Check it out.

<13-9,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. Ivan Podofski?

<13-11,ESPOSITO>找到了
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Boom.

401
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,860
<13-12,MONTGOMERY>看来找到赢家了
<13-12,MONTGOMERY>Looks like we have a winner.

402
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,930
<14-1,BECKETT>说的对  他真挺像山姆大叔的
<14-1,BECKETT>You're right. He does kinda look like Yosemite Sam.

403
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,510
<14-2,MONTGOMERY>头发不太像
<14-2,MONTGOMERY>On a bad hair day.

404
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,610
<14-3,RYAN>除了这把古董枪收藏
<14-3,RYAN>Yeah, well, in addition to having an antique gun collection,

405
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,460
<14-3,RYAN>普多斯基先生因为投资了被害人的基金
<14-3,RYAN>Mr. Podofski here lost more than 4 million bucks

406
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,810
<14-3,RYAN>赔了四百万美元
<14-3,RYAN>in our vic's lower tide fund.

407
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,140
<14-4,ESPOSITO>他在基金赔钱的当天
<14-4,ESPOSITO>He also left this message for Goldstein

408
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,600
<14-4,ESPOSITO>给古德斯坦留了语音信息
<14-4,ESPOSITO>the day the fund flatlined.

409
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,580
<14-5,PODOFSKI>古德斯坦  在古时候
<14-5,PODOFSKI>They had a way of handling folks like you

410
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,320
<14-5,PODOFSKI>人们有专门的方法对付你这种人
<14-5,PODOFSKI>in the old country, Goldstein.

411
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,640
<14-5,PODOFSKI>那就是行刑队
<14-5,PODOFSKI>It's called a firing squad.

412
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,960
<14-6,CASTLE>你觉得他会给他遮眼布和香烟吗
<14-6,CASTLE>Do you think he offered him a blindfold and a cigarette?

413
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,840
<14-4,ESPOSITO>在古时候  人们有专门的方法
<14-4,ESPOSITO>They had a way of handling folks like you

414
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,690
<14-5,PODOFSKI>对付你这种人  古德斯坦
<14-5,PODOFSKI>in the old country, Goldstein.

415
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,960
<14-5,PODOFSKI>那就是行刑队
<14-5,PODOFSKI>It's called a firing squad.

416
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,380
<15-1,PODOFSKI>我觉得你们该弄清楚来龙去脉
<15-1,PODOFSKI>I think some context is in order.

417
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,430
<15-1,PODOFSKI>我只不过损失了四百万美元
<15-1,PODOFSKI>I had only just lost $4 million.

418
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,970
<15-2,CASTLE>没错  来龙去脉就是
<15-2,CASTLE>Yes, and in that context,

419
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,900
<15-2,CASTLE>你威胁要杀了古德斯坦
<15-2,CASTLE>you threatened to kill Mr. Goldstein,

420
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,920
<15-2,CASTLE>然后他果然就死了
<15-2,CASTLE>and then he was killed.

421
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,100
<15-3,BECKETT>昨晚11点到1点之间你在哪儿
<15-3,BECKETT>Where were you last night between 11:00 and 1:00?

422
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,810
<15-6,PODOFSKI>-在家睡觉  -有人能证明吗
<15-6,PODOFSKI>- Asleep in my bed.  - And can anyone vouch for that?

423
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,510
<15-7,CASTLE>-我  -要不要再加上我和我自己啊
<15-7,CASTLE>- Me.  - Myself and I got your back, too?

424
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,440
<15-8,PODOFSKI>好吧  这是有无法让人信服
<15-8,PODOFSKI>Okay, look, I know how this appears.

425
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,810
<15-8,PODOFSKI>但  我能解释
<15-8,PODOFSKI>But I think there's, uh, an explanation.

426
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,870
<15-9,BECKETT>说来听听
<15-9,BECKETT>Fire away.

427
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,630
<15-10,PODOFSKI>几个月前  我去伯曼罗斯做咨询
<15-10,PODOFSKI>Several months ago, I had a consultation at Berman Rose.

428
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,070
<15-10,PODOFSKI>当我提到枪时  古德斯坦问我怎样能
<15-10,PODOFSKI>When I mentioned my guns, Goldstein asked if I knew

429
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,460
<15-10,PODOFSKI>搞到一把福尔摩斯那样的枪
<15-10,PODOFSKI>how he could get ahold of a Sherlock Holmes gun.

430
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,460
<15-11,CASTLE>你是在指证阿瑟·柯南·道尔先生吗
<15-11,CASTLE>So you're pointing the finger at sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

431
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,910
<15-12,PODOFSKI>我是说古德斯坦对古董枪
<15-12,PODOFSKI>I'm saying that Goldstein clearly had an interest

432
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,190
<15-12,PODOFSKI>有很浓厚的兴趣
<15-12,PODOFSKI>in antique guns.

433
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,190
<15-12,PODOFSKI>可能是好奇害死猫
<15-12,PODOFSKI>Maybe that interest got him killed.

434
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,300
<15-13,BECKETT>既然你这么确信
<15-13,BECKETT>You are so confident that

435
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,850
<15-13,BECKETT>古德斯坦和别的人有过节
<15-13,BECKETT>Goldstein got mixed up with someone else.

436
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,290
<15-13,BECKETT>那么你应该不会介意
<15-13,BECKETT>I'm sure you won't mind

437
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,680
<15-13,BECKETT>把你的收藏品拿来给我们做检测吧
<15-13,BECKETT>submitting your collection for testing with ballistics.

438
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,450
<15-14,PODOFSKI>那可是古董啊  警探
<15-14,PODOFSKI>These are antiques, detective.

439
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,320
<15-15,BECKETT>你想因谋杀罪而被捕吗
<15-15,BECKETT>Would you prefer being arrested for murder?

440
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,320
<16-1,RYAN>已经在对普多斯基的枪做弹道检测了
<16-1,RYAN>Ballistics has taken possession of Podofski's guns.

441
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,100
<16-1,RYAN>明天应该就能拿到初步结果
<16-1,RYAN>They should have preliminary results by tomorrow.

442
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,780
<16-2,CASTLE>没人喜欢摊上谋杀的罪名啊
<16-2,CASTLE>They never prefer to be arrested for murder.

443
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,300
<16-3,BECKETT>-好  继续追查  -好的
<16-3,BECKETT>- All right.  - Keep at it. Yeah.

444
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,080
<16-4,RYAN>哟  刚从交通执法部门
<16-4,RYAN>Yo. Just got a hit from Goldstein's car

445
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,520
<16-5,ESPOSITO>弄到一张古德斯坦的罚单
<16-5,ESPOSITO>from traffic enforcement.

446
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,620
<16-5,ESPOSITO>昨晚开的违规停车罚单
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Parking ticket from last night.

447
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,290
<16-6,CASTLE>-不可能  -怎么了
<16-6,CASTLE>- No way.  - What?

448
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,160
<16-7,BECKETT>这绝对不可能
<16-7,BECKETT>This has gotta be a joke.

449
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,260
<16-9,ESPOSITO>你说什么呢  卡塞尔
<16-9,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about, Castle?

450
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,420
<16-10,CASTLE>古德斯坦开的是德罗林
<16-10,CASTLE>Goldstein drives a Delorean.

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,490
<16-10,CASTLE>就是《回到未来》里
<16-10,CASTLE>The car used as a time machine

452
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,990
<16-10,CASTLE>可以当作时光机器的那辆车
<16-10,CASTLE>in "Back to the future"?

453
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,480
<16-10,CASTLE>不可能  肯定是巧合
<16-10,CASTLE>There's no way. That's a coincidence.

454
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,410
<16-11,BECKETT>罚单是凌晨2点开的
<16-11,BECKETT>The ticket was written at 2:00 in the morning.

455
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,330
<16-12,ESPOSITO>即遇害之后  那车应该还在那儿
<16-12,ESPOSITO>That's postmortem. Car should still be there.

456
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,640
<16-13,BECKETT>没错  在东82区  列克星敦和第三大道之间
<16-13,BECKETT>Yeah, east 82nd between Lex and third.

457
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,330
<16-13,BECKETT>离公园只有几个街区
<16-13,BECKETT>That's a few blocks from the park.

458
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,640
<16-14,CASTLE>对  但既然要非法停车
<16-14,CASTLE>Yeah, but if you're gonna park illegally,

459
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,380
<16-14,CASTLE>为什么不停近一点呢
<16-14,CASTLE>why not park closer?

460
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,490
<16-16,BECKETT>因为  他要到那一街区的某个地方去
<16-16,BECKETT>Because he was going somewhere on that block.

461
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,570
<16-15,ESPOSITO>过去几个月内还有三张停车罚单
<16-15,ESPOSITO>Three more parking tickets in the last several months,

462
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,350
<16-15,ESPOSITO>都是在同一个区域
<16-15,ESPOSITO>all on 82nd between Lex and third.

463
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,770
<16-16,BECKETT>也就是说他定期去拜访那个地方
<16-16,BECKETT>So he was going somewhere regularly on that block.

464
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,840
<16-17,ESPOSITO>可能他女朋友在那儿
<16-17,ESPOSITO>Maybe a girlfriend.

465
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,830
<16-18,BECKETT>你觉得时间涟漪有可能在那儿吗
<16-18,BECKETT>Unless you think that's where that time ripple is.

466
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,730
<16-19,CASTLE>有可能
<16-19,CASTLE>Could be.

467
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,660
<16-20,BECKETT>继续调查  把那车弄走
<16-20,BECKETT>Look into it. Pick that car up.

468
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,790
<16-20,BECKETT>明白
<16-20,BECKETT>Got you.

469
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,650
<17-1,ESPOSITO>不是吧
<17-1,ESPOSITO>You gotta be kidding me.

470
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,170
<17-2,RYAN>没错  这就是古德斯坦的车
<17-2,RYAN>Well, it's definitely Goldstein's car...

471
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,600
<17-2,RYAN>或者是  时间机器
<17-2,RYAN>Or a... Time machine.

472
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,130
<17-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  若我没看错的话
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Yep. If I'm not mistaken,

473
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,040
<17-3,ESPOSITO>那儿有个通量电容器
<17-3,ESPOSITO>that's a flux capacitor in there.

474
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,110
<17-4,RYAN>这儿还有个反应堆堆芯
<17-4,RYAN>And that is the reactor core.

475
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,580
<17-4,RYAN>也许卡塞尔是对的
<17-4,RYAN>Maybe Castle was right.

476
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,040
<17-4,RYAN>古德斯坦穿越到了现代
<17-4,RYAN>Goldstein came back to the future,

477
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,170
<17-4,RYAN>结果有来无回了
<17-4,RYAN>and he got whacked, huh?

478
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,310
<17-5,RYAN>-他为什么要来这儿呢  -不知道
<17-5,RYAN>- Why'd he keep coming here?  - I don't know.

479
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,820
<17-6,ESPOSITO>可能车里会有些线索
<17-6,ESPOSITO>Maybe there's something in the car that'll help.

480
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,980
<17-7,RYAN>希望如此吧  还有的忙呢
<17-7,RYAN>Hope so. Lot of doors to knock on.

481
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,970
<17-8,ESPOSITO>哟  帕蒂  这儿有辆死者的车
<17-8,ESPOSITO>Yo, Patty. I got a vic's car

482
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,370
<17-8,ESPOSITO>来拖走吧
<17-8,ESPOSITO>that needs towing.

483
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,060
<17-8,ESPOSITO>在东82街的238号
<17-8,ESPOSITO>It's at 238 east 82nd.

484
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,280
<17-8,ESPOSITO>是一辆81或82年的德罗林
<17-8,ESPOSITO>It's an '81 to '82 Delorean.

485
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,760
<17-8,ESPOSITO>车牌号为纽约JLD
<17-8,ESPOSITO>New York plates j-l-d--

486
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,560
<17-9,RYAN>过来一下  哈维
<17-9,RYAN>Hey, Javi.

487
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,590
<17-10,ESPOSITO>我再打给你
<17-10,ESPOSITO>Let me call you back.

488
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,160
<17-10,ESPOSITO>先生  打扰一下
<17-10,ESPOSITO>Excuse us, sir.

489
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,750
<17-11,RYAN>我是莱恩警探  这位是埃斯波西托警探
<17-11,RYAN>I'm detective Ryan. This is detective Esposito.

490
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,220
<17-11,RYAN>我们能问您几个问题吗
<17-11,RYAN>Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?

491
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,540
<17-12,LORD HENRY>啊  警察先生  早上愉快
<17-12,LORD HENRY>Ah! Top of the morning to you, constables.

492
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,700
<17-12,LORD HENRY>亨利勋爵愿意为您服务
<17-12,LORD HENRY>Lord Henry at your service.

493
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,640
<17-13,RYAN>谢谢  您能告诉我们
<17-13,RYAN>Uh, thanks. You mind telling us

494
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,850
<17-13,RYAN>这衣服哪儿来的吗
<17-13,RYAN>where you got those clothes?

495
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,370
<17-14,LORD HENRY>哦  没问题  孩子  是我在公园对面的
<17-14,LORD HENRY>Oh, not at all, dear boy. I picked them up

496
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,300
<17-14,LORD HENRY>服饰用品店附近捡的
<17-14,LORD HENRY>at the haberdashery across the park.

497
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,220
<17-14,LORD HENRY>先生们  问完了的话
<17-14,LORD HENRY>Well, gentlemen, if that is all,

498
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,990
<17-14,LORD HENRY>那么日安啦
<17-14,LORD HENRY>I shall bid you good day.

499
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,180
<17-15,ESPOSITO>再等一下  老兄
<17-15,ESPOSITO>Just a second, pal.

500
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,520
<17-15,ESPOSITO>是这样的  我们认为这衣服
<17-15,ESPOSITO>You know, we think those clothes

501
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,090
<17-16,LORD HENRY>-可能和某个  -我说了日安
<17-16,LORD HENRY>- might have been involved--  - I said "Good day."

502
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,110
<17-17,ESPOSITO>-先生  我们想请您跟我们  -日安
<17-17,ESPOSITO>- Sir, we need you to come down--  - Good day!

503
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,950
<17-19,RYAN>你没事吧  兄弟
<17-19,RYAN>You all right, bro?

504
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,930
<17-20,ESPOSITO>没事
<17-20,ESPOSITO>I'm fine.

505
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,040
<17-21,LORD HENRY>放开我  你这恶棍
<17-21,LORD HENRY>Unhand me, you rogue!

506
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,970
<18-1,BECKETT>好  谢谢  莱恩
<18-1,BECKETT>All right. Thank you, Ryan.

507
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,930
<18-2,CASTLE>埃斯波西托怎么样
<18-2,CASTLE>How's Esposito?

508
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,200
<18-3,BECKETT>在家休息
<18-3,BECKETT>At home resting.

509
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,950
<18-3,BECKETT>那个亨利勋爵的话得到了证实
<18-3,BECKETT>So our lord Henry's story checks out.

510
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,880
<18-3,BECKETT>莱恩在亨利说的那个地方的垃圾桶里
<18-3,BECKETT>Ryan found a matching ascot in a garbage can

511
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,980
<18-3,BECKETT>找到了一条和衣服相匹配的领带
<18-3,BECKETT>where henry said that he found the clothes.

512
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,610
<18-3,BECKETT>那家伙是有点可疑  但他不是凶手
<18-3,BECKETT>Our guy might be unstable, but he is not our killer.

513
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,250
<18-3,BECKETT>古德斯坦为什么要穿成这样呢
<18-3,BECKETT>So why was Goldstein wearing this costume?

514
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,700
<18-4,CASTLE>这可是维多利亚时代的啊  样式很老了
<18-4,CASTLE>Well, it's Victorian, antique...

515
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,660
<18-4,CASTLE>完全符合时光穿越之说
<18-4,CASTLE>Kind of fits with the whole time traveler theory,

516
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,560
<18-4,CASTLE>不是吗
<18-4,CASTLE>don't you think?

517
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,780
<18-5,LANIE>我真是搞不懂了  事情越来越复杂了
<18-5,LANIE>I don't know what to think, but the plot thickens.

518
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,040
<18-6,BECKETT>衣服检测结果出来啦
<18-6,BECKETT>Forensics came back on the clothes?

519
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,240
<18-7,LANIE>遭受了垃圾箱和流浪汉两轮劫难后
<18-7,LANIE>Between the garbage can and our homeless guy,

520
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,500
<18-7,LANIE>衣服上粘了很多恶心的东西
<18-7,LANIE>there was quite a list of gross-out substances,

521
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,010
<18-7,LANIE>那些我就不细说了  不过在
<18-7,LANIE>of which I will spare you the details, but I did find

522
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,840
<18-7,LANIE>右手套和衬衣袖口处
<18-7,LANIE>something interesting on the right hand glove

523
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,550
<18-7,LANIE>我发现了一些有趣的东西
<18-7,LANIE>and the right sleeve of the shirt--

524
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,520
<18-8,BECKETT>-钾  硝酸盐和硫  -弹药残留物
<18-8,BECKETT>- Potassium, nitrate and sulfur.  - Gunshot residue?

525
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,220
<18-9,CASTLE>古德斯坦并不是空手去的
<18-9,CASTLE>So Goldstein did not go quietly into the night,

526
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,890
<18-10,BECKETT>-他拿着枪  -而且还击了
<18-10,BECKETT>- He had a gun.  - And he fired back.

527
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,540
<19-1,CSU TECH>这里有发现
<19-1,CSU TECH>I got something here.

529
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,420
<20-2,BECKETT>又一颗老式子弹
<20-2,BECKETT>Another antique.

530
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,350
<20-3,RYAN>-和古德斯坦身上的那颗很像  -确实
<20-3,RYAN>- Looks exactly like the one that killed Goldstein. - It does.

531
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,060
<20-4,CASTLE>假设凶手
<20-4,CASTLE>Let's say that our killer...

532
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,960
<20-5,CASTLE>假设凶手站在
<20-5,CASTLE>Let's say that our killer is standing...

533
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,610
<20-5,CASTLE>这里
<20-5,CASTLE>Over here.

534
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,260
<20-5,CASTLE>而古德斯坦是在那里被杀害的
<20-5,CASTLE>Goldstein was killed all the way over there.

535
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,400
<20-5,CASTLE>他们中间是一片平地
<20-5,CASTLE>A nice flat area between them.

536
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,140
<20-6,RYAN>你在说什么  卡塞尔  某种游戏吗
<20-6,RYAN>What are you getting at, Castle, some kind of game?

537
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,460
<20-6,RYAN>不是游戏
<20-6,RYAN>Not a game.

538
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,050
<20-7,CASTLE>古德斯坦穿着很正式的衣服
<20-7,CASTLE>Goldstein was wearing formal turn-of-the-century clothes.

539
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,470
<20-7,CASTLE>他用的是老式子弹
<20-7,CASTLE>He shot an antique bullet

540
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,340
<20-7,CASTLE>和杀他的那颗一样
<20-7,CASTLE>identical to the one he was killed with,

541
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,650
<20-7,CASTLE>说不定来自同一把枪
<20-7,CASTLE>Probably fired from an identical gun.

542
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,160
<20-7,CASTLE>4  5  6  7
<20-7,CASTLE>Four, five, six, seven.

543
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,000
<20-7,CASTLE>蕾妮说他大概是在午夜被杀害的
<20-7,CASTLE>Lanie said he was killed at about midnight?

544
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,760
<20-7,CASTLE>圣·詹姆斯教堂在那边
<20-7,CASTLE>St. James church is right over there--

545
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,170
<20-7,CASTLE>谢谢  在麦迪逊大街上
<20-7,CASTLE>Thanks--on madison.

546
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,880
<20-7,CASTLE>我猜他们从这儿可以清楚的听到
<20-7,CASTLE>I bet they could hear the bells chiming

547
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,500
<20-5,CASTLE>教堂的乐钟
<20-5,CASTLE>all the way from over here.

548
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,980
<20-6,RYAN>39  40
<20-6,RYAN>39, 40...

549
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,740
<20-7,CASTLE>他们相聚大概40步
<20-7,CASTLE>They stood at about 40 paces from one another.

550
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,990
<20-7,CASTLE>这不是游戏是什么
<20-7,CASTLE>It wasn't a game.

551
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,690
<20-7,CASTLE>是种古老的决斗游戏
<20-7,CASTLE>It was an old-fashioned duel.

552
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,770
<21-1,CASTLE>竟敢诽谤
<21-1,CASTLE>Who dares besmirch...

553
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,590
<21-2,ASHLEY>-哦  别开枪  -我可真荣幸
<21-2,ASHLEY>- Oh, God, don't shoot!  - My honor?

554
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,900
<21-3,ALEXIS>别紧张  阿什利  他不会开枪的
<21-3,ALEXIS>It's okay, Ashley. He's not gonna shoot you.

555
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,220
<21-3,ALEXIS>你干什么呢  老爸
<21-3,ALEXIS>What the heck, dad?!

556
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,590
<21-4,CASTLE>我还想问你这个问题呢
<21-4,CASTLE>I might be asking you the same...

557
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,240
<21-4,CASTLE>阿什利  这就是阿什利
<21-4,CASTLE>Ashley? This is Ashley?

558
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,930
<21-5,ALEXIS>阿什  这是我爸爸  里克
<21-5,ALEXIS>Ash, this is my dad, Rick.

559
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,630
<21-5,ALEXIS>你拿着把枪干嘛
<21-5,ALEXIS>And I have no idea why he's waving a gun.

560
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,710
<21-6,ASHLEY>很高兴见到你卡塞尔先生
<21-6,ASHLEY>So nice to meet you, Mr. Castle.

561
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,630
<21-7,CASTLE>我也是  阿什利
<21-7,CASTLE>You, too, Ashley,

562
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,860
<21-7,CASTLE>同时我也完全可以解释
<21-7,CASTLE>And I have a perfectly good reason

563
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,580
<21-7,CASTLE>为啥我拿着枪
<21-7,CASTLE>why I'm waving a gun.

564
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,910
<21-8,ALEXIS>不好意思
<21-8,ALEXIS>Excuse us.

565
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,990
<21-9,ALEXIS>好好儿解释一下
<21-9,ALEXIS>Explain yourself.

566
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,630
<21-10,CASTLE>我拿这把枪是为了查个案子
<21-10,CASTLE>I got this gun for research for a case,

567
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,820
<21-10,CASTLE>如果你今天和我联系过
<21-10,CASTLE>which you might know if you had

568
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,590
<21-10,CASTLE>这事儿就不难知道
<21-10,CASTLE>checked in with me today.

569
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,450
<21-11,ALEXIS>这话什么意思
<21-11,ALEXIS>What's that supposed to mean?

570
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,830
<21-12,CASTLE>就是说  我什么都会向你坦白
<21-12,CASTLE>Let's just say, one of us has nothing to hide.

571
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,730
<21-12,CASTLE>也许你才该解释一下这是什么情况
<21-12,CASTLE>Perhaps you'd like to explain yourself?

572
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,770
<21-13,ALEXIS>解释什么  我和男生接吻吗
<21-13,ALEXIS>What, that I was kissing a boy?

573
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,830
<21-13,ALEXIS>-这很重要吗  -你说呢
<21-13,ALEXIS>- Is that a problem?  - You tell me.

574
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,630
<21-15,ALEXIS>爸爸  今晚我请阿什利过来
<21-15,ALEXIS>Dad, the only reason I invited Ashley over tonight

575
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,800
<21-15,ALEXIS>是想让你见见他
<21-15,ALEXIS>was so you could meet him.

576
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,780
<21-16,CASTLE>好吧  让我见阿什利
<21-16,CASTLE>Yes, well, me meeting Ashley

577
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,950
<21-16,CASTLE>竟然把你的唇彩都弄到脸上去了
<21-16,CASTLE>has smeared the lip gloss all over your face.

578
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,000
<21-17,ASHLEY>我  我应该告辞了
<21-17,ASHLEY>Uh, I-I-I really should be going.

579
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,590
<21-18,ALEXIS>可以再坐会儿  阿什利
<21-18,ALEXIS>You can stay, Ashley.

580
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,020
<21-19,CASTLE>哦  关于枪
<21-19,CASTLE>Oh, the gun.

581
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:16,880
<21-19,CASTLE>是我的不对
<21-19,CASTLE>My bad.

582

592
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,920
<21-24,ASHLEY>我会不尊敬她
<21-24,ASHLEY>worry about issues of respect.

593
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,750
<21-24,ASHLEY>她是我认识的最值得尊敬的人了
<21-24,ASHLEY>She's probably the most respectable person I know,

<21-24,ASHLEY>我也很尊敬你
<21-24,ASHLEY>and I-I respect you, too.

00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,420
<21-26,CASTLE>小伙子挺尊老爱幼的
<21-26,CASTLE>He's respectful.

600
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,600
<22-2,CASTLE>嘿
<22-2,CASTLE>Hey.

601
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,710
<22-3,BECKETT>嘿  经过弹道检查  伊万·普多斯基的枪
<22-3,BECKETT>Hey. So Ivan Podofski's antique gun collection

602
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,630
<22-3,BECKETT>都没问题
<22-3,BECKETT>all cleared ballistics.

603
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,660
<22-4,CASTLE>好吧  至少检查人员拿着古董枪
<22-4,CASTLE>Well, at least some guy in ballistics

604
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,940
<22-4,CASTLE>过了把瘾
<22-4,CASTLE>had fun firing 'em off.

605
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,520
<22-5,BECKETT>我也查了古德斯坦的妹妹和工作伙伴
<22-5,BECKETT>I also checked with Goldstein's sister and coworkers.

606
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,740
<22-5,BECKETT>他们都不知道
<22-5,BECKETT>None of them know anything about

607
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,040
<22-5,BECKETT>决斗和衣服的事
<22-5,BECKETT>duels or Victorian clothes

608
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,450
<22-5,BECKETT>也不知道他在东82街干什么
<22-5,BECKETT>or what goldstein was doing on east 82nd.

609
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,990
<22-6,CASTLE>听起来他有不可告人的秘密
<22-6,CASTLE>Sounds like he had a secret life.

610
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,670
<22-7,BECKETT>导致他参加决斗
<22-7,BECKETT>That somehow led to a duel.

611
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,880
<22-8,CASTLE>或者他发现某人玷污了他的荣誉
<22-8,CASTLE>Maybe he figured someone besmirched his honor.

612
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,830
<22-8,CASTLE>也有可能是为了女人  事实上
<22-8,CASTLE>Maybe it was about a girl. Matter of fact, Alexis,

613
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,270
<22-8,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯那个起了女人名字的新男友
<22-8,CASTLE>Her new boyfriend--who has a girl's name, by the way--

614
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,560
<22-8,CASTLE>昨晚以为我会对他开枪
<22-8,CASTLE>He thought I was gonna shoot him last night.

615
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,470
<22-10,CASTLE>-嘿  -嘿  埃斯波西托怎么样了
<22-10,CASTLE>- Hey. - Hey. How's esposito?

616
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,610
<22-11,RYAN>他睡了  主要是因为他不睡也干不了啥事
<22-11,RYAN>He's sleeping in, mostly because he can't move.

617
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,670
<22-12,BECKETT>你弄清古德斯坦在东82街干什么了吗
<22-12,BECKETT>Did you figure out what Goldstein was doing on east 82nd?

618
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,520
<22-13,RYAN>不  但我搜查了古德斯坦的车子
<22-13,RYAN>No, but get this. I'm going through Goldstein's car,

619
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,480
<22-13,RYAN>找到了一叠收据  他肯定是准备
<22-13,RYAN>And I find a pile of receipts he must have been planning

620
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,230
<22-13,RYAN>拿去报销
<22-13,RYAN>To submit for reimbursement,

621
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,420
<22-13,RYAN>有一张是在三周前的咖啡馆
<22-13,RYAN>One of 'em from three weeks ago at a cafe.

622
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,820
<22-13,RYAN>这里  他写下了与特洛伊·肯沃西喝咖啡
<22-13,RYAN>On it, he wrote "Coffee with Troy Kenworth,"

623
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,660
<22-13,RYAN>那名字令我想起了某件事
<22-13,RYAN>And that name kinda rings a bell.

624
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,810
<22-14,CASTLE>其中一个愤怒的低潮基金投资者
<22-14,CASTLE>One of the angry lower tide fund investors?

625
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,990
<22-15,RYAN>不  但他的父亲查尔斯·肯沃西是
<22-15,RYAN>No, but his father Charles Kenworth was.

626
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,720
<22-15,RYAN>那家伙输了两百万
<22-15,RYAN>Guy loses 2 million bucks,

627
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,690
<22-15,RYAN>失去了他的房子  他的婚姻
<22-15,RYAN>And then he loses his house, his marriage,

628
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,460
<22-15,RYAN>然后在两个月前自杀了
<22-15,RYAN>And then two months ago, he killed himself.

629
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,190
<22-16,BECKETT>特洛伊有任何前科吗
<22-16,BECKETT>Did Troy have any priors?

630
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,320
<22-17,RYAN>是的  但都是之后的事
<22-17,RYAN>Yeah, more like afters.

631
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,170
<22-17,RYAN>他的父亲自杀之后
<22-17,RYAN>After his father committed suicide,

632
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,390
<22-17,RYAN>他被控分别在四间酒吧进行殴斗
<22-17,RYAN>He was charged with assault in four separate bar fights.

633
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,680
<22-18,CASTLE>复仇  书里记载最古老的杀人动机
<22-18,CASTLE>Revenge... Oldest motive for murder in the book.

634
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,260
<22-18,CASTLE>或者特洛伊觉得
<22-18,CASTLE>Maybe Troy thought someone

635
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,700
<22-18,CASTLE>某人玷污了他父亲的荣誉
<22-18,CASTLE>besmirched his father's honor.

636
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,170
<22-19,BECKETT>然后他逼古德斯坦负上责任
<22-19,BECKETT>And then he forced Goldstein to settle the score.

637
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,360
<23-1,TROY>没错  是我发现他的尸体
<23-1,TROY>Yeah, I was the one who found his body.

638
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,120
<23-2,BECKETT>报告说他有一把猎枪
<23-2,BECKETT>the report says that he used a shotgun.

639
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,870
<23-2,BECKETT>嘿
<23-2,BECKETT>Hey.

640
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,770
<23-3,MONTGOMERY>你为什么不进去
<23-3,MONTGOMERY>Why aren't you in there?

641
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,860
<23-4,CASTLE>贝克特正在母爱泛滥
<23-4,CASTLE>Beckett's doing a mothering thing.

642
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,270
<23-4,CASTLE>想要减少房间里的男性荷尔蒙
<23-4,CASTLE>Wanted to limit the testosterone on the room.

643
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,150
<23-5,BECKETT>我无法想象你遭受的痛苦
<23-5,BECKETT>I can't imagine walking in on that.

644
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,150
<23-5,BECKETT>是的
<23-5,BECKETT>Yeah.

645
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,540
<23-6,TROY>太糟了  我尽量不去想起
<23-6,TROY>Pretty messy. I try not to think about it.

646
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,420
<23-7,BECKETT>我明白
<23-7,BECKETT>I understand.

647
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,330
<24-1,BECKETT>但自从那之后  肯沃西先生
<24-1,BECKETT>But since then, mr. Kenworth,

648
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,610
<24-1,BECKETT>你被四起待审的袭击案件指控
<24-1,BECKETT>You have charges pending in four assault cases.

649
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,180
<24-2,TROY>我喝多了  打架而已
<24-2,TROY>I started drinking too much, lashed out.

650
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,330
<24-3,BECKETT>但那些只是普通群众
<24-3,BECKETT>But those were just random people at bars.

651
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,090
<24-3,BECKETT>我是说  他们跟你父亲的死
<24-3,BECKETT>I mean, they weren't even responsible

652
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,620
<24-3,BECKETT>一点关系也没有
<24-3,BECKETT>For your father's suicide.

653
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,920
<24-3,BECKETT>但古德斯坦
<24-3,BECKETT>But Goldstein...

654
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,680
<24-3,BECKETT>他说服你父亲投资基金
<24-3,BECKETT>He put your father in the fund

655
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,820
<24-3,BECKETT>结果输光了他所有的财产
<24-3,BECKETT>That lost him all of his money.

656
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,300
<24-3,BECKETT>我能理解你责怪他
<24-3,BECKETT>I could understand blaming him.

657
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,680
<24-4,TROY>我有  但后来我跟他谈过了  他说
<24-4,TROY>I did, but then I talked to him, and he said

658
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,410
<24-4,TROY>他警告过我父亲要分拆资金
<24-4,TROY>That he warned pop to diversify.

659
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,320
<24-4,TROY>事实是  我父亲和母亲
<24-4,TROY>And the fact is, dad and mom

660
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,680
<24-4,TROY>多年前就一直有矛盾
<24-4,TROY>Have been having problems for years.

661
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,110
<24-4,TROY>当他输掉了房子后
<24-4,TROY>When we lost the house,

662
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,020
<24-4,TROY>而我又必须退学
<24-4,TROY>and I had to drop out of school,

663
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,670
<24-4,TROY>她承受不起  于是我母亲离开了他
<24-4,TROY>It was the last straw, and mom left him.

664
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,500
<24-4,TROY>这事把他逼上了绝路
<24-4,TROY>That's what pushed him over the edge,

665
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,820
<24-4,TROY>自从他死了之后  我妈努力挣钱
<24-4,TROY>And ever since his death, mom's been struggling

666
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,170
<24-4,TROY>支付我们的租金
<24-4,TROY>To make payments on our apartment.

667
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,330
<24-5,BECKETT>这就是你三周前
<24-5,BECKETT>Is that why you went to go

668
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,910
<24-5,BECKETT>见古德斯坦的理由吗
<24-5,BECKETT>see Goldstein three weeks ago?

669
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,100
<24-6,TROY>我想知道户口还有没有剩余的钱
<24-6,TROY>I wanted to find out if any money was

670
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,070
<24-7,BECKETT>那古德斯坦说什么了
<24-7,BECKETT>left in the account. And what did Goldstein tell you?

671
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,250
<24-8,TROY>事实  所有钱都输光了
<24-8,TROY>The truth. All the money's gone.

672
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,950
<24-9,BECKETT>那么你肯定很生气吧
<24-9,BECKETT>Well, that must have made you pretty angry.

673
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,610
<24-9,BECKETT>好吧  我知道你想说什么
<24-9,BECKETT>Okay, I know what you're getting at,

674
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,130
<24-10,TROY>但这次谈话改变了我
<24-10,TROY>But that meeting is what turned me around.

675
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,150
<24-10,TROY>自从那时候起我没喝过酒
<24-10,TROY>I haven't had a drink since,

676
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,790
<24-10,TROY>我母亲和我得以继续住在那里
<24-10,TROY>Mom and I have been able to stay in our place.

<24-10,TROY>我下学期甚至可以回学校读书
<24-10,TROY>I might even go back to school next semester.

678
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,070
<24-10,TROY>这全因为丹尼是一个正直的人
<24-10,TROY>All because Danny's a stand-up guy,

679
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,070
<24-10,TROY>他给我找了一份工作
<24-10,TROY>and he gave me a job.

<24-15,BECKETT>- I could be fired. - Or you could be arrested.

714
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,650
<27-1,OWEN>我们昨天听说了丹尼的事  难以置信
<27-1,OWEN>We all heard about Danny yesterday. Hard to believe.

<27-3,OWEN>我们只是比较浪漫派  探长
<27-3,OWEN>We're just romantics, detective.

<27-6,CASTLE>- Did he tell you what he was doing? - No.

726
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,880
<27-8,BECKETT>他去公园决斗了
<27-8,BECKETT>He went to the park for a duel.

727
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,420
<27-9,OWEN>什么意思  决斗
<27-9,OWEN>What do you mean, a duel?

728
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,060
<27-10,CASTLE>人们向对方开枪的那种
<27-10,CASTLE>The kind where people shoot at each other.

729
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,380
<27-10,CASTLE>他们用的是古董枪
<27-10,CASTLE>They were using antique guns.

730
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,470
<27-10,CASTLE>你有任何头绪吗
<27-10,CASTLE>Do you know anything about that?

731
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,620
<28-1,OWEN>决斗用手枪
<28-1,OWEN>Dueling pistols.

732
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,870
<28-2,CASTLE>还有  呃  氧化铅外壳的子弹
<28-2,CASTLE>With, uh, lead balls with white coating?

733
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,240
<28-3,BECKETT>最近开过枪
<28-3,BECKETT>This has been fired recently.

734
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,670
<28-4,OWEN>但那是为了表演用的
<28-4,OWEN>But they're just for show.

735
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,510
<28-5,BECKETT>亚当  停下  停下
<28-5,BECKETT>Adam, stop! Stop!

<28-6,BECKETT>快让开  快让开
<28-6,BECKETT>Out of the way! Get out of the way!

738
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,450
<28-7,CASTLE>我想他要去时间机器那里了
<28-7,CASTLE>I think he's going for the time machine!

739
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,810
<29-1,RYAN>只是一些问讯工作
<29-1,RYAN>It's just a bunch of interviews.

740
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,100
<29-1,RYAN>我不晓得你为什么不请假算了
<29-1,RYAN>I don't know why you didn't take the whole day off.

741
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,930
<29-2,ESPOSITO>因为我没事
<29-2,ESPOSITO>Because I'm fine.

742
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:23,840
<29-2,ESPOSITO>墨菲
<29-2,ESPOSITO>Murphy!

743
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,930
<29-3,BECKETT>把他拦下
<29-3,BECKETT>Stop him!

744
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,610
<29-4,CASTLE>嘿  埃斯波西托
<29-4,CASTLE>Hey, esposito.

745
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,350
<29-4,CASTLE>你的脖子怎么样
<29-4,CASTLE>How's your neck?

746
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,770
<29-4,CASTLE>没错  我开枪了
<29-4,CASTLE>Yeah, I shot him.

747
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,380
<30-1,ADAM>他就只是那样向后倒下了
<30-1,ADAM>He just kinda crumpled over backwards,

748
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,550
<30-1,ADAM>我以为他在开玩笑
<30-1,ADAM>But I thought he was kidding.

749
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
<30-1,ADAM>我跑过去以为他随时会跳起来
<30-1,ADAM>I jogged over expecting him to jump up any second,

750
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,400
<30-1,ADAM>但他只是  躺在那里
<30-1,ADAM>But he was just-- just lying there so still,

751
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,910
<30-1,ADAM>然后我看见了血  听到茱莉亚尖叫
<30-1,ADAM>A-and then I saw the blood, and I hear Julia.

752
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,300
<30-1,ADAM>她跪在地上尖叫  不  上帝  不
<30-1,ADAM>She's on her knees screaming, "No. Please, god, no."

753
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,390
<30-1,ADAM>我  我吓坏了
<30-1,ADAM>I-I-I freaked out.

754
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,460
<30-2,BECKETT>我们拿了他的衣服  然后  然后逃跑了
<30-2,BECKETT>We took his clothes, and--and I just ran.

755
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,850
<30-2,BECKETT>茱莉亚  你是说古德斯坦的助理
<30-2,BECKETT>Julia? You mean Goldstein's assistant?

756
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,320
<30-3,ADAM>他爱上了她
<30-3,ADAM>He was in love with her.

757
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,910
<30-4,CASTLE>他们好上很久了吗
<30-4,CASTLE>Had they been seeing each other a long time?

758
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,830
<30-5,ADAM>不  不  丹只亲过她一次
<30-5,ADAM>No, no, Dan just kissed her once,

759
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,030
<30-5,ADAM>几周前在酒吧外面
<30-5,ADAM>A couple weeks ago out at a bar,

760
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,000
<30-5,ADAM>但她  她对他没有兴趣
<30-5,ADAM>But she--she wasn't interested in him.

761
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,450
<30-6,BECKETT>所以你跟她好上了
<30-6,BECKETT>So you were involved with her?

762
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,420
<30-7,ADAM>也不算是
<30-7,ADAM>Not really involved,

763
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,070
<30-7,ADAM>但丹上周晚上抓到我们
<30-7,ADAM>But Dan caught us fooling around in my office

764
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,030
<30-7,ADAM>在我办公室里鬼混
<30-7,ADAM>Late one night last week.

765
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,310
<30-8,BECKETT>除了决斗以外
<30-8,BECKETT>And you couldn't think of a better way of

766
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,470
<30-8,BECKETT>你们就想不到其他更好的方法了吗
<30-8,BECKETT>settling this other than a duel?

767
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,950
<30-9,ADAM>我们只是觉得那会很有趣
<30-9,ADAM>We--we--we just thought it would be funny.

768
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,750
<30-9,ADAM>丹尼发誓没人会受伤
<30-9,ADAM>Danny swore that we couldn't get hurt.

769
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,460
<30-10,CASTLE>向对方开枪
<30-10,CASTLE>Shooting at each other?

770
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,140
<30-11,ADAM>他计算过那些复杂的公式
<30-11,ADAM>He--he ran all these complex equations.

771
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,270
<30-11,ADAM>他说我们隔着四十步的距离
<30-11,ADAM>He said--said that at 40 paces, there was no chance

772
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,910
<30-11,ADAM>是不可能伤害到对方的
<30-11,ADAM>That we could actually hit each other, something about

773
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
<30-11,ADAM>什么十八世纪的枪  枪管里没有装膛线
<30-11,ADAM>18th century guns having no rifling in the barrel.

774
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,990
<30-12,CASTLE>那如果你们不能伤害对方的话
<30-12,CASTLE>So if you couldn't kill each other,

775
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,290
<30-12,CASTLE>决斗还有什么意义
<30-12,CASTLE>What was the point of the duel?

776
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,990
<30-13,ADAM>讨茱莉亚的欢心
<30-13,ADAM>to impress Julia.

777
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,610
<30-13,ADAM>她从来不会对我们这样的怪胎认真的
<30-13,ADAM>she would never get serious with geeks like us.

778
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,530
<30-13,ADAM>但我们觉得  如果她看见我们为她决斗
<30-13,ADAM>But we figured that maybe if-- if she saw us duel over her,

779
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,350
<30-13,ADAM>那  或许我们  我们其中
<30-13,ADAM>Then... maybe that one--that one of--

780
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,550
<30-13,ADAM>我们其中一个可以
<30-13,ADAM>One of us c--

781
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,960
<31-1,RYAN>茱莉亚证实了她是
<31-1,RYAN>Julia confirmed that she was

782
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,370
<31-1,RYAN>决斗时唯一的目击者
<31-1,RYAN>The only other person present at the duel.

783
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,340
<31-1,RYAN>没其他人知道
<31-1,RYAN>No one else knew.

784
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,460
<31-2,BECKETT>好的  让她走
<31-2,BECKETT>All right. Let her go.

785
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,260
<31-3,RYAN>你怎么可以把枪口对着某人
<31-3,RYAN>how do you point the gun at someone

786
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,120
<31-4,BECKETT>开枪  却没想过会杀死他
<31-4,BECKETT>And shoot and not expect to kill them?

787
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,370
<31-5,CASTLE>他们被那些浪漫蒙蔽了双眼
<31-5,CASTLE>Well, they were blinded by the romance of it all,

788
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,680
<31-5,CASTLE>而且古德斯坦计算过了
<31-5,CASTLE>And Goldstein did the math.

789
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,070
<31-6,BECKETT>决斗的事还有低潮基金
<31-6,BECKETT>Well, between this and the lower tide fund,

790
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,720
<31-6,BECKETT>或者他并不是天才
<31-6,BECKETT>Maybe he wasn't such a genius.

791
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,880
<31-7,CASTLE>又或者只是运气差
<31-7,CASTLE>Or maybe he's just unlucky.

792
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,940
<31-8,BECKETT>那我就遇上难题了
<31-8,BECKETT>Well, then I've got a problem,

793
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,210
<31-8,BECKETT>因为我要给检察官一份报告
<31-8,BECKETT>Because I have to make a recommendation to the D.A.

794
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,790
<31-8,BECKETT>谋杀和误杀分别
<31-8,BECKETT>Between murder and manslaughter,

795
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:37,380
<31-8,BECKETT>被判的刑期可是终身监禁
<31-8,BECKETT>The difference being life in prison

796
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,560
<31-8,BECKETT>或者几年
<31-8,BECKETT>Or just a couple of years.

797
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,070
<31-8,BECKETT>我是说  古董枪真的那么不准吗
<31-8,BECKETT>I mean, are antique guns really so inaccurate?

798
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,960
<31-9,CASTLE>只有一个方法可以知道
<31-9,CASTLE>Only one way to find out.

799
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,710
<32-1,UNIFORM>那是你的靶子  这是我的
<32-1,UNIFORM>That's your target. That's my target.

800
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,560
<32-1,UNIFORM>是的  我
<32-1,UNIFORM>Yeah, well, I--

801
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,550
<32-1,UNIFORM>打你自己的靶子
<32-1,UNIFORM>Shoot your target.

802
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,780
<32-2,CASTLE>绝对是误杀
<32-2,CASTLE>Manslaughter it is.

803
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,880
<32-2,CASTLE>没错
<32-2,CASTLE>Yeah.

804
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,300
<33-1,ALEXIS>爸
<33-1,ALEXIS>Hey, dad.

805
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,700
<33-2,CASTLE>我的宝贝女儿
<33-2,CASTLE>Hey, there's my girl.

806
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,840
<33-2,CASTLE>过来
<33-2,CASTLE>Come here.

807
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,550
<33-3,CASTLE>对不起  稍等
<33-3,CASTLE>Sorry. Hang on.

808
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,020
<33-3,CASTLE>好了  搞掂了
<33-3,CASTLE>Okay. There we go.

809
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,780
<33-3,CASTLE>昨天晚上
<33-3,CASTLE>Hey, about, uh, last night,

810
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,140
<33-3,CASTLE>我  有点事出突然
<33-3,CASTLE>Um, I was... It was unexpected.

811
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,720
<33-5,CASTLE>对不起
<33-5,CASTLE>Yeah. I'm -- I'm sorry.

812
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,750
<33-6,ALEXIS>我也很抱歉
<33-6,ALEXIS>I'm sorry, too.

813
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,670
<33-6,ALEXIS>我应该告诉你阿什利是男生的
<33-6,ALEXIS>I should've told you Ashley was a boy.

814
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,120
<33-7,CASTLE>不  为什么要破坏掉这个惊喜呢
<33-7,CASTLE>No, why, uh, why spoil the surprise?

815
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,000
<33-8,ALEXIS>我有个问题想问你
<33-8,ALEXIS>So I have a question for you,

816
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,440
<33-8,ALEXIS>但是有点尴尬
<33-8,ALEXIS>but it's a little embarrassing.

817
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,480
<33-9,CASTLE>-我最喜欢你尴尬的样子了  -爸
<33-9,CASTLE>- Ooh. I love when you embarrass yourself.  - Dad.

818
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,080
<33-10,ALEXIS>听着  你可以
<33-10,ALEXIS>Well, hey, listen, you can, uh...

819
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,540
<33-11,CASTLE>你可以问我任何事情
<33-11,CASTLE>You can ask me whatever you want,

820
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,910
<33-11,CASTLE>而且  我保证  我会尽力
<33-11,CASTLE>and... I promise, I'll do my best

821
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,170
<33-11,CASTLE>缓解所有的尴尬
<33-11,CASTLE>to make it as unembarrassing as possible.

822
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,310
<33-12,ALEXIS>你怎么知道自己是不是恋爱了呢
<33-12,ALEXIS>How do you know when you're in love?

823
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,430
<33-13,CASTLE>我知道这是一种情绪
<33-13,CASTLE>I know it's an emotion...

824
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,950
<33-14,ALEXIS>一种你无法确切描述的感觉
<33-14,ALEXIS>a feeling, and you can't exactly define,

825
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,540
<33-14,ALEXIS>只有你亲身经历才知道感觉对了
<33-14,ALEXIS>like, technically, how you know when you're feeling it,

826
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,960
<33-14,ALEXIS>但是因为我以前从来没有过这种感觉
<33-14,ALEXIS>but since I've never felt it before,

827
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,690
<33-14,ALEXIS>我怎么知道我现在感觉到的是不是爱情呢
<33-14,ALEXIS>how do I know what I'm feeling is even it at all?

828
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,590
<33-14,ALEXIS>当然  除了我现在
<33-14,ALEXIS>Except, of course, for the fact

829
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,350
<33-14,ALEXIS>体会到了这些前所未有过的感觉
<33-14,ALEXIS>that I'm feeling all these things I've never felt before,

830
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,640
<33-14,ALEXIS>我的胃  我的喉咙
<33-14,ALEXIS>like in my stomach and my throat

831
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,060
<33-14,ALEXIS>好像就连我的耳朵都感觉到了
<33-14,ALEXIS>and even kind of in my ears.

832
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,800
<33-14,ALEXIS>这些只能说明这就是爱  对吧
<33-14,ALEXIS>I mean, which just has to mean that it's love, right?

833
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,210
<33-14,ALEXIS>特别是我只有在跟阿什利在一起
<33-14,ALEXIS>Considering I only feel them when I'm with Ashley

834
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,320
<33-15,CASTLE>或是想到他的时候  才有这些感觉
<33-15,CASTLE>or thinking about him,

835
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,430
<33-15,CASTLE>这只能说明我恋爱了  对吧
<33-15,CASTLE>I mean, that's gotta be love, right?

836
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,700
<33-16,ALEXIS>-如果  -因为以前
<33-16,ALEXIS>- If --  - 'Cause I'm feeling all these things

837
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,730
<33-16,ALEXIS>我在诗歌里读到过
<33-16,ALEXIS>I've read about in poems

838
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,810
<33-16,ALEXIS>还有在歌曲里听到过
<33-16,ALEXIS>and heard about in songs

839
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,780
<33-16,ALEXIS>但却不全然理解的东西
<33-16,ALEXIS>but never completely understood,

840
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,380
<33-16,ALEXIS>我现在全理解了  我能体会了
<33-16,ALEXIS>but now I do. I understand. And I'm listening

841
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,120
<33-16,ALEXIS>我现在对这些音乐和诗歌
<33-16,ALEXIS>to all this music and reading all this poetry

842
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,530
<33-16,ALEXIS>有了一个全新的喜人的理解了
<33-16,ALEXIS>in a completely new and glorious light,

843
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,720
<33-16,ALEXIS>这只能说明我恋爱了
<33-16,ALEXIS>which I think just has to mean that it's love.

844
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,610
<33-17,CASTLE>-你觉得呢  -我
<33-17,CASTLE>- What do you think?  - I --

845
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,690
<33-18,ALEXIS>我无法不想他  爸
<33-18,ALEXIS>I can't stop thinking about him, daddy.

846
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:33,660
<33-18,ALEXIS>我也乐意时刻惦记着他
<33-18,ALEXIS>I don't even want to,

847
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,410
<33-18,ALEXIS>因为他是最好  最体贴  最可爱的人
<33-18,ALEXIS>'cause he's the greatest, sweetest, most adorable guy,

848
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,470
<33-18,ALEXIS>他笑得时候鼻子会皱起来
<33-18,ALEXIS>and his nose crinkles when he laughs,

849
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,850
<33-18,ALEXIS>然后我也就跟着开心
<33-18,ALEXIS>and I'm just so happy.

850
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,030
<33-19,ALEXIS>谢谢老爸  我爱你
<33-19,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad. I love you.

851
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,270
<33-19,ALEXIS>我现在觉得舒服多了
<33-19,ALEXIS>I feel so much better now.

852
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,320
<33-20,CASTLE>跟你聊天很高兴
<33-20,CASTLE>I'm glad we had that talk.

854
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,890
<33-21,CASTLE>你怎么知道自己是否恋爱了
<33-21,CASTLE>How do you know when you're in love?

855
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,090
<33-22,BECKETT>所有歌都听得懂了
<33-22,BECKETT>All the songs make sense.

856
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,000
<33-23,BECKETT>亚当 墨菲没杀古德斯坦
<33-23,BECKETT>Adam Murphy didn't kill Goldstein.

857
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,410
<33-24,CASTLE>但是他认罪了
<33-24,CASTLE>But he confessed.

858
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,860
<33-25,BECKETT>我认为他也相信是自己干的
<33-25,BECKETT>And I believe that he believes he did it,

859
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,710
<33-24,CASTLE>但其实不是
<33-24,CASTLE>but he didn't.

860
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,990
<33-26,CASTLE>-说来听听  -我一直在想
<33-26,CASTLE>- Do tell.  - It bothered me

861
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,570
<33-27,BECKETT>我们在射击场怎么也打不中靶子的事
<33-27,BECKETT>that we couldn't hit the target at the shooting range,

862
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,440
<33-27,BECKETT>所以我就对那两把枪做了弹道测试
<33-27,BECKETT>and so I ran ballistics on the dueling pistols.

863
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,980
<33-27,BECKETT>射中丹尼尔·古德斯坦的子弹
<33-27,BECKETT>The bullet that hit Daniel Goldstein

864
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,060
<33-27,BECKETT>不符合任何一把枪的弹道测试结果
<33-27,BECKETT>didn't match either one of them.

865
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,920
<33-27,BECKETT>亚当不可能是凶手
<33-27,BECKETT>Adam couldn't have killed him.

866
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,230
<33-28,CASTLE>你是在说公园里的阴谋论
<33-28,CASTLE>You're talking full-on, grassy knoll conspiracy theory.

867
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,090
<33-29,BECKETT>不是理论  是事实
<33-29,BECKETT>Not theory, fact.

868
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,510
<33-29,BECKETT>当时有第三个枪手在场
<33-29,BECKETT>There was a third shooter,

869
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,690
<33-29,BECKETT>他才是我们要找的凶手
<33-29,BECKETT>and that's our killer.

870
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,730
<34-1,RYAN>贝克特
<34-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett!

871
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,990
<34-2,BECKETT>找到亚当 墨菲的子弹了吗
<34-2,BECKETT>Did you find Adam Murphy's bullet?

872
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,740
<34-3,CASTLE>那个铅球
<34-3,CASTLE>Lead ball.

873
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,810
<34-4,RYAN>找到了  他没打中古德斯坦
<34-4,RYAN>Yep. He didn't kill Goldstein.

874
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,750
<34-4,RYAN>却打中了松鼠
<34-4,RYAN>But he did kill squirrelstein.

875
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,710
<34-5,RYAN>够巧的吧
<34-5,RYAN>What are the odds, huh?

876
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,860
<34-6,CASTLE>不  它也被扒光了
<34-6,CASTLE>Oh, no. They took his clothes, too.

877
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,920
<34-6,CASTLE>你把它拿回去吧
<34-6,CASTLE>- Could you?  - Aww.

878
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,860
<34-7,RYAN>我明白  不好意思
<34-7,RYAN>Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

879
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,550
<35-1,BECKETT>那么我们知道
<35-1,BECKETT>Okay, so we know that

880
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,160
<35-1,BECKETT>古德斯坦当晚站在这
<35-1,BECKETT>Goldstein was standing right over here...

881
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,930
<35-2,CASTLE>面对着站在那边的亚当
<35-2,CASTLE>facing Adam, who was right over there.

882
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,530
<35-3,BECKETT>没错  那么如果我们的凶手想要杀他
<35-3,BECKETT>Right, and if our killer wanted to shoot him

883
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,110
<35-3,BECKETT>却又不能被这两个人看见
<35-3,BECKETT>without either of them seeing him,

884
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,260
<35-3,BECKETT>他就只能站在
<35-3,BECKETT>he would be standing right over...

885
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,970
<35-3,BECKETT>那  那个树丛边
<35-3,BECKETT>there, by that clump of trees.

886
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,880
<36-1,CSU TECH>探员  我发现了衣物纤维
<36-1,CSU TECH>Detective, I've got clothing fibers.

887
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,190
<36-2,BECKETT>这根线看上去眼熟吧
<36-2,BECKETT>This thread looks familiar?

888
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,580
<36-3,CASTLE>我无论到哪都能认出这种红色天鹅绒
<36-3,CASTLE>Oh, I'd recognize that burgundy velvet anywhere.

889
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,310
<36-4,BECKETT>让人想起了19世纪科幻小说  不是吗
<36-4,BECKETT>Kinda says "steampunk", doesn't it?

890
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,530
<36-5,CASTLE>实际上
<36-5,CASTLE>Matter of fact,

891
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,740
<36-5,CASTLE>我想我知道凶器是什么了
<36-5,CASTLE>I think I know the murder weapon.

892
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,600
<37-1,CASTLE>《地心历险记》里的火山
<37-1,CASTLE>Volcano in "Journey to the center of the earth"--

893
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,240
<37-1,CASTLE>是斯奈山吗
<37-1,CASTLE>Snaefells?

894
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,850
<37-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<37-2,BECKETT>Castle.

895
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,920
<37-3,TROY>离不开这里是吧  有什么可以帮忙的吗
<37-3,TROY>Couldn't stay away, huh? Can I get you guys something?

896
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,670
<37-4,BECKETT>当然  特洛伊
<37-4,BECKETT>Sure, Troy.

897
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,180
<37-4,BECKETT>我们在找一个枪手
<37-4,BECKETT>We're looking for a shooter.

898
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,560
<37-5,CASTLE>事实上  我想我们已经找到了
<37-5,CASTLE>Actually, I think we already found one.

899
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,130
<37-5,CASTLE>顺便说一句  制服不错
<37-5,CASTLE>Nice uniform, by the way.

900
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,100
<37-6,BECKETT>我们找到了你父亲的猎枪
<37-6,BECKETT>We found your father's shotgun.

901
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,410
<37-6,BECKETT>我们知道你为了打老式的铅弹
<37-6,BECKETT>We know that you modified it

902
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,170
<37-6,BECKETT>而改过那把枪
<37-6,BECKETT>in order to shoot antique lead ball bullets.

903
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,450
<37-7,TROY>你们在说什么
<37-7,TROY>What are you talking about?

904
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,750
<37-7,TROY>亚当 墨菲已经认罪了对吧
<37-7,TROY>Adam Murphy already confesse right?

905
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
<37-8,CASTLE>结果发现不可能是亚当 墨菲干的
<37-8,CASTLE>Turns out Adam Murphy couldn't have done it.

906
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,950
<37-8,CASTLE>是那种科学弹道之类的东西证明的
<37-8,CASTLE>It's a sciencey ballistics thing.

907
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,870
<37-9,BECKETT>在亚当和古德斯坦开枪的那一瞬间
<37-9,BECKETT>It was pretty clever, firing your father's shotgun

908
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
<37-9,BECKETT>扣动你父亲的枪
<37-9,BECKETT>at the exact moment that

909
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,140
<37-9,BECKETT>真是很聪明的做法
<37-9,BECKETT>Adam and Goldstein fired their guns.

910
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:32,960
<37-10,CASTLE>使亚当相信
<37-10,CASTLE>Making Adam believe

911
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,460
<37-10,CASTLE>是他杀了古德斯坦的
<37-10,CASTLE>that he was the one that killed Goldstein,

912
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,880
<37-10,CASTLE>就在教堂敲响午夜钟声的时候
<37-10,CASTLE>right as the church bells chimed midnight.

913
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,550
<37-10,CASTLE>难道不是吗
<37-10,CASTLE>Isn't that right?

914
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,390
<37-11,TROY>每天晚上看着他在这里
<37-11,TROY>Seeing him in here every night

915
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,270
<37-11,TROY>穿着那荒唐的衣服
<37-11,TROY>in that ridiculous outfit...

916
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,110
<37-11,TROY>然后大把大把地扔钱
<37-11,TROY>just throwing around all that money?

917
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,820
<37-11,TROY>为什么他可以那样活着
<37-11,TROY>Why should he get to live like that

918
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,890
<37-11,TROY>而我父亲却死了

919
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,400
<38-1,BECKETT>得知凶手是俱乐部的工作人员
<38-1,BECKETT>Knowing that our shooter was a staff member at the club

920
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,910

00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,640
<38-3,BECKETT>推翻了特洛伊的不在场证明
<38-3,BECKETT>as soon as we started interviewing other staff members

925
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,150
<38-3,BECKETT>在决斗前后的半个小时里
<38-3,BECKETT>who couldn't remember seeing him there
