1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,310
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>激动吧激动吧
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Isn't this exciting?

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,530
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>只是个周末而已  老妈
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>It's just a weekend, mother.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,590
<1-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸  这是你与贝克特第一次共度浪漫周末
<1-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad, it's your first romantic weekend away with Beckett.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,420
<1-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>这可是大事
<1-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>It's a big deal.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,150
<1-4,CASTLE>别给我压力  希望能成行吧
<1-4,CASTLE>Okay, well, no pressure, and let's just hope it happens.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,480
<1-4,CASTLE>现在是四点半  如果到五点都没有凶案发生
<1-4,CASTLE>4:30 now. If she doesn't catch a murder by 5:00,

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,480
<1-4,CASTLE>那我们就能去了
<1-4,CASTLE>We are in the clear.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,130
<1-5,MARTHA>说说看  有什么计划
<1-5,MARTHA>So what do you have planned?

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,210
<1-6,CASTLE>-我...什么意思  -你居然没计划
<1-6,CASTLE>- I--what do you mean? - You don't have a plan?

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,220
<1-6,CASTLE>-计划就是什么也不做  去放松  -理查德
<1-6,CASTLE>- The plan is to do nothing, to relax. - Richard--

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,900
<1-7,ALEXIS>这可不是计划
<1-7,ALEXIS>That's not a plan.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,260
<1-10,ALEXIS>女生不喜欢男生没计划
<1-10,ALEXIS>Women don't like it when men don't have a plan.

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,930
<1-10,ALEXIS>我现在上大学了  活在现实世界中
<1-10,ALEXIS>Hey, I'm in college now. I'm living in the world.

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,150
<1-10,ALEXIS>而且我看了很多杂志
<1-10,ALEXIS>Plus, I read a lot of magazines.

15
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,580
<1-10,ALEXIS>没有计划真的很糟糕
<1-10,ALEXIS>Not planning is really bad.

16
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,770
<1-11,CASTLE>-好吧  -她说的对
<1-11,CASTLE>- Okay-- - She's right.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,170
<1-12,MARTHA>如果有男人对我说  "晚餐去哪里吃"
<1-12,MARTHA>A man says, "So what are we gonna do for dinner?"

18
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,410
<1-12,MARTHA>切  果断不会有下文了
<1-12,MARTHA>Pfft. He's dead to me.

19
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,160
<1-13,CASTLE>好吧  我会在餐厅订位的
<1-13,CASTLE>Okay. I will make reservations.

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,230
<1-14,ALEXIS>有浪漫情调的地方
<1-14,ALEXIS>Somewhere romantic.

21
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,160
<1-16,MARTHA>-好的  -有档次的
<1-16,MARTHA>- Right. - And classy,

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,010
<1-16,MARTHA>因为凯特·贝克特是个有品位的女生
<1-16,MARTHA>because Kate Beckett is a classy kind of gal, you know?

23
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,570
<1-15,CASTLE>对
<1-15,CASTLE>Right.

24
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,840
<1-18,ALEXIS>在星空下会很浪漫
<1-18,ALEXIS>Under the stars would be nice.

25
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,590
<1-19,MARTHA>你知道在星空下还能做什么吗
<1-19,MARTHA>Oh, and you know what else you can do under the stars--

26
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,850
<1-19,MARTHA>好啦  不听不听不听
<1-19,MARTHA>Okay. La la la la la la la

27
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,240
<2-1,CASTLE>倒计时一分钟开始
<2-1,CASTLE>T-minus one minute and counting.

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,380
<2-1,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你来这里做什么
<2-1,CASTLE>Castle, what are you doing here?

29
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,320
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>你应该在街角等我
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>You were supposed to wait around the corner

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,300
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>这样没人会看见
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>so that nobody'd see us.

31
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,640
<2-3,CASTLE>我知道  但我觉得这样会很有意思
<2-3,CASTLE>I know, but I thought it would be fun

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,610
<2-3,CASTLE>在这里陪你看着时钟走到五点
<2-3,CASTLE>to be here with you when the clock strikes 5:00.

33
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,160
<2-3,CASTLE>就像过新年倒数一样
<2-3,CASTLE>You know, just like new year's eve,

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,670
<2-3,CASTLE>可惜不能亲吻  原因就不用多说了
<2-3,CASTLE>except without the kissing for obvious reasons.

35
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,340
<2-3,CASTLE>但这周末将会有无数的亲吻
<2-3,CASTLE>But there will be plenty of that this weekend.

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,710
<2-4,BECKETT>你小声点儿
<2-4,BECKETT>Can you just shush?

37
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,100
<2-5,CASTLE>没人会听到的
<2-5,CASTLE>No one is going to hear me.

38
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,890
<2-5,CASTLE>看看周围
<2-5,CASTLE>Look around you.

39
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,160
<2-5,CASTLE>满屋子的警探
<2-5,CASTLE>You are in a room full of detectives...

40
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,050
<2-5,CASTLE>完全没人发现蛛丝马迹
<2-5,CASTLE>and not one of them has a clue.

41
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,550
<2-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<2-6,BECKETT>Wow, Castle.

42
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,120
<2-6,BECKETT>多谢你提醒我
<2-6,BECKETT>Thank you for reminding me that I'm lying

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,590
<2-6,BECKETT>我在对很多自己关心的人撒谎
<2-6,BECKETT>to a bunch of people that I really care about

44
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,510
<2-6,BECKETT>这样才不会因为和你约会
<2-6,BECKETT>so I don't get fired on an ethics violation

45
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,400
<2-6,BECKETT>违反了职业操守而被炒鱿鱼
<2-6,BECKETT>'cause I'm dating you.

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,070
<2-7,CASTLE>你很快就会忘掉这些了  再过三
<2-7,CASTLE>Well, you can put all that out of your mind in three...

47
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,790
<2-7,CASTLE>二  一秒
<2-7,CASTLE>two... one.

48
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,900
<2-7,CASTLE>没有凶案
<2-7,CASTLE>No murder.

49
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,090
<2-8,CASTLE>怎样  有意思吧
<2-8,CASTLE>There. Wasn't that fun?

50
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,450
<2-9,CASTLE>好吧  我马上走  没人甚至会发现我来...
<2-9,CASTLE>Okay, fine. I will go. And no one will even know I was--

51
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,140
<2-10,RYAN>卡塞尔
<2-10,RYAN>Hey, Castle.

52
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,380
<2-11,ESPOSITO>你怎么来了  哥们儿
<2-11,ESPOSITO>What you doing here, bro?

53
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,180
<2-12,CASTLE>我正要去汉普顿
<2-12,CASTLE>I was just on my way to the Hamptons

54
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,580
<2-12,CASTLE>周末在那里写作
<2-12,CASTLE>to write for the weekend,

55
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,450
<2-12,CASTLE>我就想着顺路过来  看看有没有凶案发生
<2-12,CASTLE>and--and I thought I'd drop by, see if we caught a murder.

56
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,940
<2-13,BECKETT>哇  抓住一切机会逃避写作啊
<2-13,BECKETT>Wow. Anything to avoid writing, huh?

57
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,110
<2-15,ESPOSITO>-正是  -你听说了贝克特的周末计划吗
<2-15,ESPOSITO>- Exactly. - Hey, did you hear about Beckett's weekend?

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,390
<2-16,CASTLE>没有  有安排吗
<2-16,CASTLE>No. Big plans?

59
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,390
<2-17,RYAN>她要和男朋友去度周末
<2-17,RYAN>She's going away with her boyfriend.

60
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,820
<2-18,CASTLE>男朋友
<2-18,CASTLE>A boyfriend?

61
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,400
<2-18,CASTLE>贝克特  真的吗
<2-18,CASTLE>Beckett! Really?

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,350
<2-19,CASTLE>这个幸运的家伙是谁啊
<2-19,CASTLE>Who is the lucky guy?

63
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,760
<2-20,ESPOSITO>出于某些原因  她不说
<2-20,ESPOSITO>For some reason, she's not telling.

64
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,310
<2-21,BECKETT>各位  你们不是吧
<2-21,BECKETT>Okay, seriously, guys?

65
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,320
<2-22,CASTLE>事实上  我觉得被鄙视了
<2-22,CASTLE>Actually, I for one am offended

66
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,410
<2-22,CASTLE>你居然不告诉我们
<2-22,CASTLE>that you're not sharing with us.

67
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,670
<2-23,RYAN>在我们同生共死那么多年后
<2-23,RYAN>After all we've been through.

68
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,540
<2-24,ESPOSITO>就是  我们有知道真相的权利
<2-24,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I think we deserve better.

69
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,620
<2-25,BECKETT>知道吗  关于你们的权利
<2-25,BECKETT>You know, I have a couple of ideas

70
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,990
<2-25,BECKETT>我倒是有些不错的想法
<2-25,BECKETT>about what you guys deserve.

71
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,240
<2-26,RYAN>拜托  贝克特  透露一下嘛
<2-26,RYAN>Come on, Beckett. Just give us something.

72
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
<2-27,CASTLE>他长得帅吗
<2-27,CASTLE>Is he handsome?

73
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,910
<2-27,CASTLE>对  他帅吗
<2-27,CASTLE>Yeah, I-is he handsome?

74
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,970
<2-28,ESPOSITO>还是说他是个野性爷们
<2-28,ESPOSITO>Or is he more of a badass?

75
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,440
<2-29,CASTLE>是这样吗  贝克特  他是野性爷们吗
<2-29,CASTLE>Yeah, is that it, Beckett? Is he, like, a bad boy?

76
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,740
<2-29,CASTLE>像詹姆士·迪恩吗  他是亡命之徒吗
<2-29,CASTLE>James Dean, huh? Is he a desperado?

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,630
<2-30,CASTLE>我闪了
<2-30,CASTLE>I'm gonna...

78
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,670
<2-31,ESPOSITO>过来聊两句
<2-31,ESPOSITO>Let me holla at you.

79
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,090
<3-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特为什么要瞒着我们
<3-1,ESPOSITO>Why would Beckett be holding out on us?

80
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,130
<3-2,RYAN>也许这男的有什么问题
<3-2,RYAN>Maybe there's something wrong with the guy.

81
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,680
<3-2,RYAN>也许是个麻烦鬼
<3-2,RYAN>Maybe he's bad news.

82
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,560
<3-3,ESPOSITO>那么作为她的搭档
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Well, then as her partners,

83
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,800
<3-3,ESPOSITO>我们有责任调查出这男的是谁
<3-3,ESPOSITO>it's our obligation to find out who this guy is.

84
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,340
<3-4,RYAN>如果不调查出来  我们还算什么搭档
<3-4,RYAN>And what kind of partners would we be if we didn't?

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,690
<3-4,RYAN>她的安全可能有危险
<3-4,RYAN>Her safety could be at stake.

86
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,520
<3-5,ESPOSITO>正是  既然现在没有凶案要破
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Exactly, and with no active murder case going on,

87
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,420
<3-5,ESPOSITO>我们就用这段时间去调查吧
<3-5,ESPOSITO>I say we use this time to find him.

96
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,340
<3-5,ESPOSITO>到了
<3-5,ESPOSITO>And here we are.

97
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,230
<3-5,ESPOSITO>我的天  卡塞尔
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Oh, my goodness, Castle.

98
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,020
<4-1,CASTLE>哇
<4-1,CASTLE>Wow.

99
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,750
<4-2,BECKETT>看来...你是阔佬啊
<4-2,BECKETT>So, um... are you rich or something?

100
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,390
<4-3,CASTLE>没有詹姆斯·帕特森[惊悚小说大师]那么富有
<4-3,CASTLE>Well, I'm not James Patterson rich,

101
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,420
<4-3,CASTLE>不过还算有几个钱
<4-3,CASTLE>but I do okay.

102
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,150
<4-5,CASTLE>-来吧  带你参观下  -好的
<4-5,CASTLE>- Come on. I'll show you around. - Yeah.

103
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,670
<4-5,CASTLE>在重新装修厨房后
<4-5,CASTLE>After I finished remodeling the kitchen,

104
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,960
<5-1,CASTLE>我发誓我想收工了  但我的设计师打电话来
<5-1,CASTLE>I swore I was done, but then my designer called.

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,520
<5-1,CASTLE>她说客厅也要翻新
<5-1,CASTLE>She said I had to tie in the living room,

106
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,740
<5-1,CASTLE>我也照办了
<5-1,CASTLE>so I did that, too.

107
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,990
<5-1,CASTLE>接着就是二楼  然后是地下室
<5-1,CASTLE>That led to the second floor, and then the basement.

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,010
<5-2,CASTLE>来看看吗
<5-2,CASTLE>You coming?

109
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,220
<32-31,OFFICER>好的
<32-31,OFFICER>Yeah.

110
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,580
<5-4,CASTLE>这是我最喜欢的部分
<5-4,CASTLE>This is actually my favorite part.

111
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,060
<5-4,CASTLE>大海的波涛声  完全的私人空间
<5-4,CASTLE>The sound of the ocean, complete privacy--

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,770
<5-4,CASTLE>好平静
<5-4,CASTLE>Oh, the serenity.

113
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,700
<5-4,CASTLE>泳池在这边
<5-4,CASTLE>The pool is right down here.

114
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,570
<5-4,CASTLE>很多人觉得很吸引人
<5-4,CASTLE>Most people find it magical.

115
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,300
<5-5,CASTLE>你还好吗
<5-5,CASTLE>Everything okay?

116
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,680
<5-6,BECKETT>没事  这里...
<5-6,BECKETT>Yeah. It's, um...

117
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,450
<5-6,BECKETT>这里太壮观了  卡塞尔
<5-6,BECKETT>It's spectacular, Castle.

118
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,090
<5-7,CASTLE>这...不好吗
<5-7,CASTLE>And is that a problem?

119
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,150
<5-8,BECKETT>只是  我情不自禁会想
<5-8,BECKETT>It's just, I can't help wondering

120
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,540
<5-8,BECKETT>曾经有多少女人参观过这间房子
<5-8,BECKETT>how many... other girls have gotten this tour.

121
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,840
<5-8,BECKETT>对
<5-8,BECKETT>Right.

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,990
<5-9,CASTLE>我不会否认
<5-9,CASTLE>Well, I'm not gonna deny

123
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,170
<5-9,CASTLE>我曾经带其他女人来过这里
<5-9,CASTLE>that I've brought other women up here.

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,690
<5-9,CASTLE>但是
<5-9,CASTLE>But, um...

125
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,160
<5-9,CASTLE>她们都不是你
<5-9,CASTLE>None of them were you.

126
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,470
<5-10,BECKETT>你想  过去看下泳池吗
<5-10,BECKETT>You want to, um, go and check out that pool?

127
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,130
<5-10,BECKETT>要去吗
<5-10,BECKETT>Yeah?

128
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,670
<6-1,CASTLE>我敢肯定你会觉得水温很适宜
<6-1,CASTLE>I'm sure you will find the temperature suitable...

129
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,900
<6-1,CASTLE>但如果你想水温更高些
<6-1,CASTLE>But if you would like it any warmer,

130
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,060
<6-1,CASTLE>我可以调  或是我直接...
<6-1,CASTLE>I can change the temperature or I could just...

131
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,910
<6-2,CASTLE>闭嘴
<6-2,CASTLE>Stop talking.

132
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,430
<6-2,CASTLE>你忘了带泳衣
<6-2,CASTLE>You forgot your suit.

133
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,910
<6-3,BECKETT>我知道
<6-3,BECKETT>I know.

134
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
<6-4,BECKETT>怎么了
<6-4,BECKETT>What?

135
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,230
<6-4,BECKETT>有人过来了
<6-4,BECKETT>Somebody's coming.

<6-5,CASTLE>快报警
<6-5,CASTLE>Call 9-1-1.

138
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,510
<6-5,CASTLE>还要你说
<6-5,CASTLE>Ya think?

148
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,210
<7-1,CASTLE>他从海滩上跌跌撞撞地走过来
<7-1,CASTLE>Yeah, he came stumbling up from the beach,

149
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,570
<7-1,CASTLE>当时刚过10:15
<7-1,CASTLE>Uh, just after 10:15.

150
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,600
<7-1,CASTLE>他跌进了泳池  我想给他急救  但是...
<7-1,CASTLE>Uh, collapsed into the pool. I tried to revive him, but--

151
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,220
<7-2,CHIEF JOHN BRADY>你当时也在现场吗  女士
<7-2,CHIEF JOHN BRADY>Were you here as well, ma'am?

152
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:43,970
<7-3,BECKETT>是的
<7-3,BECKETT>Yeah.

153
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,900
<7-4,BRADY>你的姓名是
<7-4,BRADY>Name, please.

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,060
<7-5,BECKETT>凯瑟琳·贝克特
<7-5,BECKETT>Um, Katherine Beckett,

155
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,270
<7-5,BECKETT>但你能不能不要记录在案
<7-5,BECKETT>But do you think we could keep that out of the public record?

156
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
<7-6,BRADY>当然
<7-6,BRADY>Of course.

157
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,190
<7-7,BECKETT>不是说我们在做什么见不得人的事  只是
<7-7,BECKETT>Not that we're doing anything wrong. I j--

158
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,870
<7-8,BRADY>明白
<7-8,BRADY>Right.

159
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,070
<7-9,BECKETT>你这话是什么意思
<7-9,BECKETT>What's that supposed to mean?

160
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,560
<7-10,BRADY>别担心  这里是汉普顿
<7-10,BRADY>Don't worry. It's the Hamptons.

161
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,280
<7-10,BRADY>我们会很谨慎的
<7-10,BRADY>We'll be discreet.

162
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,230
<7-10,BRADY>我们对你的"情趣安排"没有兴趣
<7-10,BRADY>We're--we're not interested in your arrangement.

163
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,970
<7-12,CASTLE>-"情趣安排"  -警长
<7-12,CASTLE>- Arrangement? - Chief, chief,

164
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,370
<7-12,CASTLE>我  我不是  她不是...
<7-12,CASTLE>Uh, I'm--I'm not-- I don't--she's not a--

165
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,030
<7-13,BECKETT>我不是卖淫的
<7-13,BECKETT>I'm not a prostitute.

166
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,590
<7-14,BRADY>那当然了
<7-14,BRADY>Oh, I'm sure.

167
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,850
<7-15,BRADY>那么  你对卡塞尔先生的陈述
<7-15,BRADY>So is there anything you'd like to add

168
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,520
<7-15,BRADY>有什么要补充的吗  女士
<7-15,BRADY>to Mr. Castle's statement, madam--ma'am?

169
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,550
<7-15,BRADY>是的
<7-15,BRADY>Yes.

170
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,970
<7-16,BECKETT>我们并没有听到任何枪声
<7-16,BECKETT>Only that we didn't hear any gunshots,

171
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,860
<7-16,BECKETT>那很可能意味着凶手使用了消音器
<7-16,BECKETT>So that probably means that the killer used a silencer.

172
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,210
<7-17,BRADY>平常没少看罪案剧吧
<7-17,BRADY>Watch a lot of cop shows, do we?

173
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,340
<7-18,CASTLE>知道死者的身份了吗
<7-18,CASTLE>Y-- uh, do we know who the victim is yet?

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,830
<7-19,BRADY>兰德尔·富兰克林
<7-19,BRADY>Uh, Randall Franklin.

175
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,340
<7-19,BRADY>他是从曼哈顿过来度周末的
<7-19,BRADY>He's a weekender, out here from Manhattan.

176
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,790
<7-19,BRADY>我们只知道  他今晚早些时候
<7-19,BRADY>All we know is that he was at a party up the beach

177
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,760
<7-19,BRADY>在道格拉斯·沙皮罗家的海滩上参加了派对
<7-19,BRADY>at Douglas Shapiro's house earlier this evening.

178
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,570
<7-20,DEPUTY ADAM JONES>嘿  长官
<7-20,DEPUTY ADAM JONES>Hey, chief!

179

<7-20,DEPUTY ADAM JONES>We got him.

180
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,240
<7-21,BRADY>失陪
<7-21,BRADY>Excuse me.

<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>Local meth user.

183
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,920
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>我们发现他
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>Found him asleep in the tall grass

184
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,300
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>在向东几百码的草丛中呼呼大睡
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>couple hundred yards to the east

185
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,710
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>他身上还藏有被害人的钱包
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>with the victim's wallet.

186
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,780
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>这货已经不省人事  嗑药嗑高了
<8-1,DEPUTY JONES>Guy's out of it, high as a kite.

187
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,920
<8-2,BRADY>简直难以置信
<8-2,BRADY>That's unbelievable.

188
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,280
<8-3,CASTLE>什么意思
<8-3,CASTLE>What's that?

189
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,410
<8-4,BRADY>冰毒  那些富二代  什么都敢吸
<8-4,BRADY>Meth. These rich kids, they're into everything these days.

190
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,730
<8-4,BRADY>过去六个月  因吸毒被抓的数量已经翻倍了
<8-4,BRADY>Drug arrests have doubled in the last six months.

191
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,060
<8-4,BRADY>好吧  行了
<8-4,BRADY>Okay. Well...

192

<8-4,BRADY>谢谢你们的协助
<8-4,BRADY>Thanks for your help.

193
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,040
<8-5,CASTLE>那血迹呢
<8-5,CASTLE>Uh, what about blood spatter?

194
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,480
<8-5,CASTLE>你们在海滩或是嫌疑人身上有发现血迹吗
<8-5,CASTLE>Did you find any on the beach or on the suspect?

195
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,980
<8-6,DEPUTY JONES>没  但还有必要找吗
<8-6,DEPUTY JONES>No. But w-why would I even look?

196
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,920
<8-6,DEPUTY JONES>我是说  我们已经抓到案犯了
<8-6,DEPUTY JONES>I mean, we got the guy.

197
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,480
<8-7,BRADY>是啊  我相信一定会发现的
<8-7,BRADY>Yeah, I-I'm sure we will.

198
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,090
<8-7,BRADY>他身上有被害人的钱包
<8-7,BRADY>He had the victim's wallet.

199
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,080
<8-8,CASTLE>是啊
<8-8,CASTLE>Right.

200
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,850
<8-9,CASTLE>话说  他可能是在沙滩上无意捡到那个钱包的
<8-9,CASTLE>Y-you know, he could've found that wallet on the beach.

201
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,890
<8-10,BRADY>你是在质疑我的判断吗  卡塞尔先生
<8-10,BRADY>Are you questioning my judgment, Mr. Castle?

202
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,910
<8-11,CASTLE>我
<8-11,CASTLE>I...

203
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,870
<8-12,BRADY>-我觉得已经抓到案犯了  -好吧
<8-12,BRADY>- Think we got the guy. - Right.

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,340
<8-12,BRADY>-晚安  -晚安
<8-12,BRADY>- Good night. - Good night.

<8-12,BRADY>好了  走吧
<8-12,BRADY>All right. Come on. Let's go.

206
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,410
<8-12,BRADY>快点
<8-12,BRADY>Move.

207
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,840
<9-1,CASTLE>什么样的冷血杀手
<9-1,CASTLE>What kind of cold-blooded killer

208
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,270
<9-1,CASTLE>会在射杀人之后还在沙滩上呼呼大睡
<9-1,CASTLE>takes a nap on the beach after shooting someone?

209
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,070
<9-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我是来度假的
<9-2,BECKETT>Castle, I'm on vacation.

210
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,120
<9-2,BECKETT>如果我想调查凶杀案
<9-2,BECKETT>If I wanted to investigate a murder,

211
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,290
<9-2,BECKETT>我直接留在市里就好了
<9-2,BECKETT>I would've stayed in the city.

212
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,210
<9-3,CASTLE>那家伙死在我的后院里
<9-3,CASTLE>The guy died in my backyard.

213
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,790
<9-4,BECKETT>这不是我们的案子
<9-4,BECKETT>It's not our case.

214
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,890
<9-5,CASTLE>但你必须承认  就案子来说
<9-5,CASTLE>Still, you have to admit, as cases go,

215
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,780
<9-5,CASTLE>此案实在弱爆了
<9-5,CASTLE>it's pretty weak.

216
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,740
<9-6,BECKETT>那也不是我们的案子  如果你继续纠结于此
<9-6,BECKETT>It's still not our case, and if you keep obsessing over this,

217
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,940
<9-6,BECKETT>会毁了我们的周末的
<9-6,BECKETT>It's gonna ruin the weekend.

218
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,130
<9-7,CASTLE>那我们该怎么做
<9-7,CASTLE>So what do we do?

219
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,010
<9-8,BECKETT>或许我们该试着不去想这件事
<9-8,BECKETT>Maybe we just try putting it out of our minds, hmm?

220
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,220
<9-9,CASTLE>好吧  但枪又是怎么回事
<9-9,CASTLE>Yeah, but what about the gun?

221
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,570
<9-9,CASTLE>他们应该在他身上找到枪才对的
<9-9,CASTLE>They would've found the gun on him.

222
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,300
<9-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你这可不叫不去想它
<9-10,BECKETT>Castle, that's not putting it out of your mind.

223
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,390
<9-11,CASTLE>你说得对  不好意思  我在纠结
<9-11,CASTLE>You're right. I'm sorry. I'm obsessing.

224
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,600
<9-13,CASTLE>-我不会再纠结了  -好的
<9-13,CASTLE>- I won't obsess. - Okay.

225
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,750
<9-14,CASTLE>但是你自己也说了没有听到枪声
<9-14,CASTLE>Except you said it yourself about not hearing the shots.

226
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,910
<9-14,CASTLE>什么样的吸毒犯
<9-14,CASTLE>What kind of meth head

227
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,420
<9-14,CASTLE>吸得都晕头转向  不知所以了
<9-14,CASTLE>who obviously doesn't know what planet he's on

228
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,890
<9-14,CASTLE>竟然会携带一把装有消音器的枪
<9-14,CASTLE>carries a gun with a silencer?

229
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,340
<9-14,CASTLE>那表明  他可是预谋作案啊
<9-14,CASTLE>Which, by the way, indicates premeditation.

230
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,280
<9-15,BECKETT>看来我们是没法好好度周末了
<9-15,BECKETT>We're not gonna get on with our weekend

231
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,940
<9-15,BECKETT>除非你找到答案  是吧
<9-15,BECKETT>until you've gotten some answers, are we?

232
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,920
<9-16,CASTLE>我去煮咖啡
<9-16,CASTLE>I'll get the coffee.

233
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,020
<10-1,CASTLE>好的  谢谢  道格
<10-1,CASTLE>All right, thank you, Dougie.

234
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,280
<10-1,CASTLE>我很遗憾错过了你的派对
<10-1,CASTLE>And I'm sorry I missed the party.

235
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,150
<10-1,CASTLE>我听说棒极了[杀手]
<10-1,CASTLE>I heard it was killer.

236
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,720
<10-1,CASTLE>抱歉  说错话了  明白
<10-1,CASTLE>Yeah, sorry. Gotcha.

237
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,070
<10-1,CASTLE>听好了  沙皮罗最后一次见到活着的富兰克林
<10-1,CASTLE>Okay, last time Shapiro saw Franklin alive

238
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,280
<10-1,CASTLE>是8:15分时在他的派对上
<10-1,CASTLE>was at his party at 8:15.

239
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,660
<10-2,BECKETT>就是他被杀前2小时
<10-2,BECKETT>That's two hours before he was killed.

240
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,070
<10-2,BECKETT>是的  他当时在海滩上
<10-2,BECKETT>Right. He was on the beach

241
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,570
<10-3,CASTLE>跟一个穿着白裙子的女人发生争吵
<10-3,CASTLE>having an argument with a woman in a white dress,

242
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,040
<10-3,CASTLE>但由于当时天很黑
<10-3,CASTLE>But because it was already dark,

243
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,890
<10-3,CASTLE>沙皮罗没认出那女人是谁
<10-3,CASTLE>Shapiro couldn't tell who it was.

244
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,070
<10-3,CASTLE>他知道那不是富兰克林的妻子
<10-3,CASTLE>He knew it wasn't Franklin's wife,

245
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,470
<10-3,CASTLE>因为她当时还在市里
<10-3,CASTLE>because she was still back in the city.

246
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,780
<10-3,CASTLE>你查到任何
<10-3,CASTLE>Any luck finding a reason

247
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,030
<10-3,CASTLE>令人想置富兰克林于死地的动机吗
<10-3,CASTLE>why someone would want franklin dead?

248
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,180
<10-4,BECKETT>实际上  他曾是雷曼兄弟公司的财务顾问
<10-4,BECKETT>As a matter of fact, he was a banker at Lehman Brothers...

249
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,720
<10-4,BECKETT>而且他曾在雷曼兄弟破产之前
<10-4,BECKETT>And he was involved in an insider trading scandal

250
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,800
<10-4,BECKETT>卷入内线交易丑闻
<10-4,BECKETT>before they went belly up.

251
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,740
<10-4,BECKETT>他为求自保  作证出卖同事
<10-4,BECKETT>He cut a deal for his freedom by testifying against his colleagues.

252
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,260
<10-5,CASTLE>蕾切尔·罗森博格  杰夫·福辛
<10-5,CASTLE>Rachel Rosenberg, Jeff Forshim,

253
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,300
<10-5,CASTLE>艾米丽·门罗  安琪拉·克拉伯  阿伦·勒纳
<10-5,CASTLE>Emily Monroe, Angela Colabro, and Aaron Lerner.

254
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,770
<10-5,CASTLE>他们都坐了牢  但现在都放出来了
<10-5,CASTLE>Well, they all did time, but now that they're out,

255
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,520
<10-5,CASTLE>他们当中的任何一个人都有可能复仇
<10-5,CASTLE>Any one of 'em could have wanted revenge.

256
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,340
<10-6,BECKETT>那三个女人中的一个可能就是白衣女人
<10-6,BECKETT>And three of them could've been our mystery woman.

257
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,520
<10-7,CASTLE>我们要去找富兰克林的妻子谈谈
<10-7,CASTLE>We need to talk to Franklin's wife,

258
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,920
<10-7,CASTLE>看看他有没有仇家
<10-7,CASTLE>find out if he had any enemies.

259
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,660
<10-7,CASTLE>不
<10-7,CASTLE>No.

260
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,150
<10-8,BECKETT>我们才刚到这儿  我才不要回市里呢
<10-8,BECKETT>We just got here. I am not going back to the city.

261
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,610
<10-9,CASTLE>幸运的是  我们不必回去
<10-9,CASTLE>Well, fortunately, we don't have to.

262
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,780
<10-9,CASTLE>我知道该打电话找谁
<10-9,CASTLE>I know just who to call.

263
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,380
<10-9,CASTLE>贝克特的男友
<10-9,CASTLE>Beckett's boyfriend?

264
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,130
<11-1,LANIE PARISH>你们没有其他事可做了吗
<11-1,LANIE PARISH>Don't you two have something better to do?

265
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,180
<11-2,ESPOSITO>实际上  真没有
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Actually, no.

266
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,740
<11-3,RYAN>我们推测贝克特肯定是
<11-3,RYAN>We figure Beckett must have

267
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,580
<11-3,RYAN>在停职期间和那家伙勾搭上的
<11-3,RYAN>started up with the guy during her suspension.

268
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,990
<11-4,ESPOSITO>那段时间她比较多愁善感
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Pretty emotional time for her.

269
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,380
<11-4,ESPOSITO>肯定需要一个男人的肩膀去依靠
<11-4,ESPOSITO>I bet she needed a shoulder to lean on.

270
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,090
<11-5,RYAN>一个前任
<11-5,RYAN>An ex.

271
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,240
<11-6,ESPOSITO>所以她才觉得很尴尬  不好意思告诉我们
<11-6,ESPOSITO>It would explain why she's too embarrassed to tell us who it is.

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,090
<11-6,ESPOSITO>那会让她显得很懦弱
<11-6,ESPOSITO>It makes her look weak.

273
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,040
<11-7,RYAN>我们推测最可能的情况是
<11-7,RYAN>We're thinking the most likely scenario

274
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,140
<11-7,RYAN>她最近才分手的前一任
<11-7,RYAN>is that it was the last guy that she was with.

275
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,480
<11-8,ESPOSITO>乔舒亚·戴维森医生
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Dr. Joshua Davidson.

276
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,500
<11-8,ESPOSITO>就是他  不是吗
<11-8,ESPOSITO>It's him, isn't it?

277
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,840
<11-9,LANIE>好吧  我明白你生活空虚  哈维
<11-9,LANIE>Okay, I get that you don't have a life, Javi,

278
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,000
<11-9,LANIE>但你都结婚了  凯文  你又为何管闲事
<11-9,LANIE>But you're married, Kevin, so what's your excuse?

279
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,760
<11-10,RYAN>-我  -不管贝克特的男友是谁
<11-10,RYAN>- I-- - whoever Beckett's boyfriend is

280
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,100
<11-11,LANIE>都不关你们的事
<11-11,LANIE>is none of your business.

281
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,930
<11-12,ESPOSITO>拜托  蕾妮  你肯定知道是谁
<11-12,ESPOSITO>Come on, Lanie. You must know who it is.

282
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,110
<11-12,ESPOSITO>她重回乔什的怀抱了  是吧
<11-12,ESPOSITO>She went back to Josh, didn't she?

283
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,010
<11-13,LANIE>你就是这样审问犯人的吗
<11-13,LANIE>Is this how you interrogate people?

284
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,470
<11-13,LANIE>你这样什么都问不出来  只会把我惹得火大
<11-13,LANIE>'cause you ain't doing nothing but pissing me off.

285
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,940
<11-13,LANIE>我不知道那人是谁  而且我尊重贝克特的隐私
<11-13,LANIE>Now I don't know who it is, and I respect Beckett's privacy,

286
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,160
<11-13,LANIE>但我知道肯定不是乔什
<11-13,LANIE>but I do know it's not Josh

287
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,480
<11-13,LANIE>因为他从去年就一直在亚马逊河域
<11-13,LANIE>because he's been in the Amazon setting up free clinics

288
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,820
<11-13,LANIE>建免费诊所
<11-13,LANIE>for the last year.

289
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,450
<11-14,ESPOSITO>你确定吗
<11-14,ESPOSITO>Are you sure about that?

290
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
<11-15,RYAN>-我想她很确定  -是的
<11-15,RYAN>- I think she's sure. - Yeah.

291
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,900
<11-16,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<11-16,ESPOSITO>Hey, Castle.

292
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,370
<11-17,RYAN>我开扬声器
<11-17,RYAN>Yeah, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone

293
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,450
<11-17,RYAN>好让你也一起来讨论下
<11-17,RYAN>so you can weigh in on this.

294
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,720
<11-18,CASTLE>讨论什么
<11-18,CASTLE>Weigh in on what?

295
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,390
<11-19,RYAN>我们在太平间  和蕾妮一起
<11-19,RYAN>Well, we're in the morgue with Lanie

296
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,090
<11-19,RYAN>想找出谁是贝克特的男朋友
<11-19,RYAN>trying to figure out who Beckett's boyfriend is.

297
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,230
<11-20,LANIE>我和这些废话没一点关系
<11-20,LANIE>I have nothing to do with this nonsense.

298
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,180
<11-21,CASTLE>没错  等贝克特发现了
<11-21,CASTLE>Yeah, until you're

299
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,650
<11-21,CASTLE>你就该为他们的碎尸装袋了
<11-21,CASTLE>bagging their mangled bodies when Beckett finds out.

300
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,410
<11-22,ESPOSITO>说得我们好像怕贝克特一样
<11-22,ESPOSITO>Pfft. Like we're afraid of Beckett.

301
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,710
<11-23,RYAN>再说了  她怎么会知道
<11-23,RYAN>Besides, how's she gonna find out?

302
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,130
<11-24,CASTLE>总之  我需要你们的帮助
<11-24,CASTLE>Anyway, I need your guys' help.

303
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,360
<11-24,CASTLE>在汉普顿  我家后院里发生了一起谋杀案
<11-24,CASTLE>There has been a homicide out here in the Hamptons in my backyard.

304
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,690
<11-25,RYAN>真的假的  卡塞尔
<11-25,RYAN>Seriously, Castle?

305
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,080
<11-25,RYAN>你难道在拍《女作家与谋杀案》吗
<11-25,RYAN>What, are you in-- in an episode of "Murder, she wrote"?

306
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,220
<11-26,CASTLE>更像《男作家与谋杀案》  但不幸的是
<11-26,CASTLE>More like "Murder, he wrote," but unfortunately,

307
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,210
<11-26,CASTLE>不像杰西卡·弗莱彻
<11-26,CASTLE>unlike Jessica Fletcher,

308
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,010
<11-26,CASTLE>当地警长可不是我的朋友
<11-26,CASTLE>the local police chief-- not a friend of mine,

309
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,700
<11-26,CASTLE>而且我觉得他很可能抓错人了  所以
<11-26,CASTLE>and I think he may have the wrong guy, so...

310
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,000
<11-26,CASTLE>我需要你们在城里审问被害人的妻子
<11-26,CASTLE>I need you guys to question the victim's wife in the city,

311
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,920
<11-26,CASTLE>看看她知道些什么
<11-26,CASTLE>find out what she knows.

312
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,600
<11-27,ESPOSITO>这可是很大一个忙啊  卡塞尔
<11-27,ESPOSITO>Mm. That's a pretty big favor to ask, Castle.

313
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,520
<11-27,ESPOSITO>我们需要点回报
<11-27,ESPOSITO>We're gonna need something in return.

314
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,160
<11-29,RYAN>-法拉利车  -借一周  -每人一周
<11-29,RYAN>- The Ferrari. - For a week. - Each.

315
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,400
<11-31,CASTLE>没搞错吧  伙计们
<11-31,CASTLE>Seriously? Guys.

316
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,330
<11-32,CASTLE>伙计们
<11-32,CASTLE>Guys.

317
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,400
<8-11,CASTLE>我不明白
<8-11,CASTLE>I don't understand.

318
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,540
<8-12,BRADY>他们已经抓住凶手了  不是吗
<8-12,BRADY>They already caught the guy, didn't they?

319
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,260
<8-12,BRADY>警方告诉我  他是个瘾君子
<8-12,BRADY>I'm told he was some kind of drug addict.

320
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,260
<8-12,BRADY>出于对汉普顿警局的尊重
<8-12,BRADY>Well, with all due respect to the Hamptons P.D.,

321
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,980
<12-1,RYAN>我们想确保万无一失
<12-1,RYAN>we would like to make absolutely sure.

322
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,590
<12-2,ESPOSITO>我们知道你丈夫
<12-2,ESPOSITO>We know your husband

323
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,750
<12-2,ESPOSITO>指证了几个雷曼兄弟公司的同事
<12-2,ESPOSITO>testified against several colleagues at Lehman.

324
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,570
<12-2,ESPOSITO>他和其中的谁还有联系吗
<12-2,ESPOSITO>Has he been in contact with any of 'em?

325
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,200
<12-2,ESPOSITO>为什么这么问
<12-2,ESPOSITO>Why are you asking?

326
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,240
<12-3,ESPOSITO>也许是他们中的某人找他报仇了
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Maybe one of them came after him for revenge.

327
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,540
<12-3,ESPOSITO>没有
<12-3,ESPOSITO>No.

328
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,170
<12-3,ESPOSITO>破产之后他就离开了银行业  再没回头
<12-3,ESPOSITO>He left banking after the crash and never looked back.

329
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,660
<12-4,RYAN>转而投身了商业地产
<12-4,RYAN>Got into commercial real estate.

330
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,850
<12-4,RYAN>这样我们才得以生存下来
<12-4,RYAN>That's how we managed to stay afloat.

331
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,620
<12-4,RYAN>富兰克林夫人
<12-4,RYAN>Mrs. Franklin,

332
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,360
<12-4,RYAN>在你丈夫被杀前几小时  有人目击到
<12-4,RYAN>your husband was seen arguing with a woman on a beach

333
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,060
<12-4,RYAN>他和一个女人发生了争执
<12-4,RYAN>a couple of hours before he was killed.

334
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,060
<12-4,RYAN>你知道她会是谁吗
<12-4,RYAN>Do you have any idea who it could have been?

335
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,600
<19-7,CASTLE>不知道
<19-7,CASTLE>No.

336
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,680
<12-3,ESPOSITO>但如果要我猜
<12-3,ESPOSITO>But if I were to guess,

337
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,690
<12-4,RYAN>可能是他的女朋友
<12-4,RYAN>I'd say it was his girlfriend.

338
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
<12-5,RYAN>女朋友
<12-5,RYAN>Girlfriend?

339
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,650
<12-5,RYAN>他有外遇
<12-5,RYAN>He was having an affair?

340
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,840
<12-5,RYAN>某个叫娜塔莉娅·罗斯福的女人
<12-5,RYAN>With a Natalia Roosevelt.

341
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,820
<13-1,BECKETT>她是当地人
<13-1,BECKETT>She's a local.

342
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,840
<13-2,CASTLE>妻子知道后  要他来这里和她分手
<13-2,CASTLE>The wife got wind of it, sent him up here to break it off.

343
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,810
<13-2,CASTLE>这可能是烂俗的汉普顿经典桥段
<13-2,CASTLE>It's probably your typical tawdry Hamptons story.

344
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,340
<13-2,CASTLE>外出度周末  遇见当地美女
<13-2,CASTLE>Weekender meets local beauty,

345
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,760
<13-2,CASTLE>减轻城市生活压力的灵丹妙药
<13-2,CASTLE>the elixir to his stressful city life.

346
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,850
<13-2,CASTLE>接着便是闪电般坠入爱河...
<13-2,CASTLE>Whirlwind romance ensues...

347
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,030
<13-2,CASTLE>但接着妻子发现了
<13-2,CASTLE>But then the wife gets wind of it,

348
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,170
<13-2,CASTLE>要他结束这段关系
<13-2,CASTLE>forces him to end it,

349
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,840
<13-2,CASTLE>这时灵丹妙药反倒成了毒药
<13-2,CASTLE>and that's when the elixir becomes a poison...

350
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,790
<13-2,CASTLE>用一把枪  只是...
<13-2,CASTLE>with a gun, only...

351
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,620
<13-2,CASTLE>结尾部分我还得想想
<13-2,CASTLE>I'm gonna have to work on that last part.

352
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,860
<13-3,BECKETT>不  故事不错  但我们要如何证明
<13-3,BECKETT>No, it's a great story, but how do we prove

353
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,180
<13-3,BECKETT>就是她在沙滩上和他发生争执的呢
<13-3,BECKETT>that it was her that he was arguing with on the beach?

354
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,290
<13-4,CASTLE>首先得查出
<13-4,CASTLE>Well, the first step is to determine

355
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,600
<13-4,CASTLE>当时她是否在派对上
<13-4,CASTLE>whether she was at the party.

356
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,640
<13-4,CASTLE>我来查下网上邀请
<13-4,CASTLE>I'll check the e-vite.

357
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,840
<13-4,CASTLE>娜塔莉娅·罗斯福  她在这里  在"参加"一列
<13-4,CASTLE>And there she is-- Natalia Roosevelt... in the "Yes" column.

358
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,870
<13-4,CASTLE>真是典型的蛇蝎美女啊
<13-4,CASTLE>And, ooh, looking every bit the femme fatale.

359
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,080
<13-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她曾是一名汉普顿的女议员
<13-5,BECKETT>Castle, she was a Hamptons town councilwoman

360
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,330
<13-5,BECKETT>也是汉普顿沙滩酒吧的老板
<13-5,BECKETT>and the owner of the Hamptons sand bar.

361
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,830
<13-6,CASTLE>那可是当地著名的酒吧
<13-6,CASTLE>That is a popular local watering hole.

362
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,840
<13-6,CASTLE>我能请你喝杯酒吗
<13-6,CASTLE>Can I buy you a drink?

363
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,270
<14-1,CASTLE>她在那儿
<14-1,CASTLE>There she is...

364
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,120
<14-1,CASTLE>我们要找的白裙女子
<14-1,CASTLE>our lady in the white dress.

365
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,010
<14-1,CASTLE>只是现在她衣着血红  令人炫目
<14-1,CASTLE>Only now she's looking dazzling in blood red.

366
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,120
<14-1,CASTLE>有什么计划
<14-1,CASTLE>So what's our play?

367
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,430
<14-2,BECKETT>低调点  卡塞尔
<14-2,BECKETT>Just keep it light, Castle.

368
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,360
<14-2,BECKETT>自然地过渡到谋杀案上
<14-2,BECKETT>Find a natural way of bringing up the murder.

369
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,490
<14-2,BECKETT>看她作何反应
<14-2,BECKETT>See how she reacts.

370
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,250
<14-3,CASTLE>我知道该做什么
<14-3,CASTLE>I know just what to do.

371
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,280
<14-4,CASTLE>我认得你
<14-4,CASTLE>Hey, I recognize you.

372
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,460
<14-4,CASTLE>你昨晚在道格拉斯·沙皮罗的派对上
<14-4,CASTLE>You were at Douglas Shapiro's party last night.

373
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,820
<14-5,NATALIA ROOSEVELT>谁不在呢
<14-5,NATALIA ROOSEVELT>Ah, who wasn't?

374
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,860
<14-6,CASTLE>是吗  但我又看见你在沙滩上
<14-6,CASTLE>Right? But I saw you on the beach.

375
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,710
<14-6,CASTLE>那时你不是在和兰德尔·富兰克林起争执吗
<14-6,CASTLE>Weren't you arguing with Randall Franklin?

376
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,370
<14-7,BECKETT>低调  卡塞尔  我说要低调
<14-7,BECKETT>Light, Castle. I said light.

377
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,710
<14-8,NATALIA>你在暗示什么
<14-8,NATALIA>What are you implying?

378
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,180
<14-9,CASTLE>没什么  只是在想你一定觉得怪怪的
<14-9,CASTLE>Nothing, no. Only it must be weird for you.

379
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,620
<14-9,CASTLE>毕竟你是最后一个见到他还活着的人
<14-9,CASTLE>You had to be the last person to see him alive.

380
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,420
<14-10,NATALIA>警长
<14-10,NATALIA>Hey, uh, chief.

381
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
<14-11,BRODY>是的  娜塔莉娅
<14-11,BRODY>Yeah, Natalia.

382
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,920
<14-12,NATALIA>-过来  -糟糕
<14-12,NATALIA>- Come here. - Oops.

383
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
<14-14,BECKETT>你认识这两个人吗
<14-14,BECKETT>Do you know these guys?

384
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,600
<14-15,NATALIA>因为他们基本是在指控我谋杀了
<14-15,NATALIA>Because they are practically accusing me of murder.

385
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,410
<14-16,BRODY>卡塞尔  你在这里做什么
<14-16,BRODY>Castle, what are you doing here?

386
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,960
<14-17,CASTLE>就聊聊天
<14-17,CASTLE>Uh, just having a conversation.

387
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,760
<14-18,BRODY>聊富兰克林的谋杀案
<14-18,BRODY>About Franklin's murder?

388
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,290
<14-18,BRODY>你对我办案的方法有意见吗
<14-18,BRODY>Hey, you got a problem with the way I do my job?

389
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,770
<14-19,CASTLE>我绝不会那样说的
<14-19,CASTLE>Uh-- now I would never use those words exactly.

390
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,640
<14-20,BRODY>是吗  那这句如何
<14-20,BRODY>Oh, well, how about these words?

391
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,040
<14-20,BRODY>你和你的妓女朋友
<14-20,BRODY>You and your hooker friend are under arrest

392
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,230
<14-20,BRODY>因涉嫌妨碍凶案调查而被捕了
<14-20,BRODY>for interfering with my murder investigation.

393
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,420
<14-20,BRODY>转过去
<14-20,BRODY>Turn around.

394
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,760
<14-21,BECKETT>多谢你的酒
<14-21,BECKETT>Thanks for the drink.

395
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,930
<14-22,CASTLE>干杯
<14-22,CASTLE>Cheers.

396
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,660
<15-1,BECKETT>真不敢相信我竟然被你说服
<15-1,BECKETT>I cannot believe I let you talk me into

397
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,500
<15-1,BECKETT>干涉了另一个警局的凶案调查
<15-1,BECKETT>getting involved in another department's murder investigation.

398
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,870
<15-2,CASTLE>说得好像我强迫你一样
<15-2,CASTLE>Oh, like I needed to twist your arm.

399
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,110
<15-2,CASTLE>至少我们对这家伙的看法是正确的
<15-2,CASTLE>And at least we know we were right about this guy.

400
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,270
<15-2,CASTLE>你觉得他看起来像是有负罪感的样子吗
<15-2,CASTLE>I mean, does he look like he has a guilty conscience to you?

401
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,470
<15-2,CASTLE>他睡得像个婴儿一样香
<15-2,CASTLE>He's sleeping like a little baby.

402
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,270
<15-3,BECKETT>更像是个小声的电锯
<15-3,BECKETT>More like a baby chainsaw.

403
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,260
<15-4,DEPUTY JONES>卡塞尔  贝克特  布雷迪警长想见你们
<15-4,DEPUTY JONES>Castle, Beckett, Chief Brady wants to see you.

404
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,830
<15-4,DEPUTY JONES>警长
<15-4,DEPUTY JONES>Chief.

405
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,840
<16-1,JONES>谢了  琼斯
<16-1,JONES>Hey, thanks, Jones.

406
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,110
<16-2,BRADY>你们好  伙计们
<16-2,BRADY>Hi, guys.

407
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,890
<16-2,BRADY>要来点咖啡吗  刚泡的
<16-2,BRADY>You want some coffee? It's fresh.

408
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,220
<16-3,CASTLE>好的  谢谢
<16-3,CASTLE>Yeah, thanks.

409
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,390
<16-4,BRADY>我谷歌过你了  贝克特女士
<16-4,BRADY>So I googled you, Ms. Beckett.

410
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,710
<16-4,BRADY>我不知道你是名凶案科警探
<16-4,BRADY>I didn't realize you were a homicide detective.

411
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,070
<16-4,BRADY>我之前从没真正碰到过谋杀案
<16-4,BRADY>I've never actually worked a homicide before.

412
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,510
<16-4,BRADY>除了逮捕毒贩  我处理的大部分案子都是
<16-4,BRADY>Other than drug arrests, I deal mostly with folks

413
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,130
<16-4,BRADY>人们抱怨邻居家的狗在他们的花园里拉屎
<16-4,BRADY>complaining about their neighbor's dog pooping in their garden.

414
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,310
<16-4,BRADY>我甚至连枪都没掏过
<16-4,BRADY>I've never even pulled my gun.

415
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,190
<16-4,BRADY>对不起
<16-4,BRADY>I'm sorry.

416
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,790
<16-5,CASTLE>为什么要跟我们说这些
<16-5,CASTLE>Uh, why are you telling us this?

417
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,760
<16-6,BRADY>关于那个嗑药的人  你说对了
<16-6,BRADY>Because you were right about the meth addict.

418
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,060
<16-6,BRADY>化验结果显示他手上没有射击后的残留物
<16-6,BRADY>The lab results came back negative for gunshot residue,

419
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,650
<16-6,BRADY>也就是说真正的凶手仍然在逃
<16-6,BRADY>which means that the killer is still at large.

420
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,470
<16-6,BRADY>市长给了我很大压力
<16-6,BRADY>Look... I'm getting a lot of pressure from the mayor.

421
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,320
<16-6,BRADY>有钱的游客被谋杀了
<16-6,BRADY>Rich weekender getting murdered,

422
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,700
<16-6,BRADY>这对我们的旅游业可不好
<16-6,BRADY>not exactly good for business.

423
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,950
<16-7,BECKETT>我还是不明白你跟我们说这些干嘛
<16-7,BECKETT>Still not getting why you're telling us this.

424
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,980
<16-7,BECKETT>直说了吧
<16-7,BECKETT>Okay.

425
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,060
<16-8,BRADY>如果你们帮我调查这起谋杀
<16-8,BRADY>I will drop the interference charge

426
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,750
<16-8,BRADY>我就不再起诉你们干涉我查案
<16-8,BRADY>if you help out with the investigation.

427
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,970
<16-9,CASTLE>我可以接受
<16-9,CASTLE>Sounds good to me.

428
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,390
<16-10,BECKETT>失陪一会
<16-10,BECKETT>Excuse me for a second.

429
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,930
<16-9,CASTLE>可以接受
<16-9,CASTLE>Sounds good?

430
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,990
<16-11,BECKETT>我们刚刚在拘留室度过了两个小时的假期时光
<16-11,BECKETT>We just spent two hours of our vacation in lockup.

431
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,450
<16-11,BECKETT>你还嫌不够吗
<16-11,BECKETT>Isn't that enough?

432
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,980
<16-12,CASTLE>你真的觉得
<16-12,CASTLE>Well, do you really think

433
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,460
<16-12,CASTLE>我们不抓到凶手  不把他绳之以法
<16-12,CASTLE>we'll be able to relax without getting any answers...

434
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,770
<16-12,CASTLE>还能享受这个假期吗
<16-12,CASTLE>without... getting justice?

435
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,240
<16-13,BECKETT>好吧
<16-13,BECKETT>Fine.

436
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,120
<16-14,BECKETT>只要不让我辖区的人知道  我就帮你
<16-14,BECKETT>As long as word doesn't get back to my precinct that I'm doing this.

437
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,470
<16-15,BRODY>没问题
<16-15,BRODY>Works for me.

438
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,480
<16-15,BRODY>那么我们下一步该做什么
<16-15,BRODY>So what do we do next?

439
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,860
<16-16,BECKETT>弹道分析结果出来了吗
<16-16,BECKETT>Did you get ballistics back?

440
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,660
<16-17,BRODY>出来了
<16-17,BRODY>Oh, yes. Uh...

441
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,250
<16-17,BRODY>上面说
<16-17,BRODY>Let's see.

442
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,980
<16-17,BRODY>死者体内的子弹口径是30毫米
<16-17,BRODY>Bullets pulled from the victim were 30 caliber.

443
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,760
<16-18,CASTLE>30毫米  这种子弹很少见啊
<16-18,CASTLE>30 caliber. Those are pretty rare, aren't they?

444
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,300
<16-19,BECKETT>对  一般用于打猎
<16-19,BECKETT>Yeah, that's usually used for hunting small game.

445
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,910
<16-19,BECKETT>我能看一下法医对富兰克林做的尸检报告吗
<16-19,BECKETT>Can I see the M.E.'s report on Franklin's body?

446
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,740
<16-20,BRODY>报告还没来
<16-20,BRODY>It has not come in yet.

447
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,150
<16-21,BECKETT>那我建议你去催一下法医让他快点
<16-21,BECKETT>Then I suggest you pressure the M.E. to get it back.

448
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,360
<16-21,BECKETT>与此同时
<16-21,BECKETT>In the meantime,

449
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,860
<16-21,BECKETT>我们应该审问一下娜塔莉娅·罗斯福
<16-21,BECKETT>we should interrogate Natalia Roosevelt.

450
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,000
<16-22,BRODY>我已经盘问过她了
<16-22,BRODY>Oh, I already spoke to her.

451
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,100
<16-22,BRODY>她没有杀富兰克林的动机
<16-22,BRODY>She has no motive for killing Franklin.

452
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,700
<16-23,BECKETT>你问过她当富兰克林情妇的事了吗
<16-23,BECKETT>And did you ask her about being his mistress?

453
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,170
<16-23,BECKETT>没有
<16-23,BECKETT>No.

454
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,160
<16-24,BRODY>她没跟我说这事啊
<16-24,BRODY>She didn't mention that.

455
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,350
<16-24,BRODY>是啊
<16-24,BRODY>Yeah.

456
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,100
<16-25,CASTLE>嫌疑人一般不会主动说这些事的
<16-25,CASTLE>Suspects tend to hold back on stuff like that.

457
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,380
<16-25,CASTLE>真有乡村风味
<16-25,CASTLE>Flavor country.

458
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,930
<17-1,NATALIA>我还以为你把他们抓起来了呢  约翰
<17-1,NATALIA>I thought you arrested these guys, John.

459
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,830
<17-2,BRADY>这位是
<17-2,BRADY>Um, that's--

460
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,200
<17-3,BECKETT>你应该称他布雷迪警长  罗斯福小姐
<17-3,BECKETT>That's Chief Brady to you, Ms. Roosevelt,

461
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,040
<17-3,BECKETT>你还是担心一下你自己
<17-3,BECKETT>And shouldn't you be more concerned about the fact that

462
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,550
<17-3,BECKETT>在跟兰德尔·富兰克林有染的事上撒了谎吧
<17-3,BECKETT>you lied to him about your affair with Randall Franklin?

463
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,140
<17-4,NATALIA>我没有撒谎
<17-4,NATALIA>I didn't lie to him.

464
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,700
<17-4,NATALIA>布雷迪警长从没问过我这件事
<17-4,NATALIA>Chief Brady never asked me about it.

465
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,250
<17-5,BECKETT>昨晚在海滩上兰德尔是不是要跟你分手
<17-5,BECKETT>Didn't Randall break up with you on the beach last night?

466
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,260
<17-6,NATALIA>是又怎么样
<17-6,NATALIA>So what if he did?

467
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,790
<17-7,BECKETT>那你就有杀人动机了  罗斯福小姐
<17-7,BECKETT>So that gives you motive, Ms. Roosevelt.

468
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,990
<17-8,NATALIA>听我说  我并不否认
<17-8,NATALIA>Look... I am not denying

469
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,490
<17-8,NATALIA>我当时跟兰德尔起了争执
<17-8,NATALIA>that I was fighting with Randall.

470
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,250
<17-8,NATALIA>我指责他
<17-8,NATALIA>I accused him of...

471
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,210
<17-8,NATALIA>利用我来获得委员会的投票
<17-8,NATALIA>using me to get my council vote.

472
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,390
<17-9,CASTLE>关于什么的投票
<17-9,CASTLE>Your vote on what?

473
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,140
<17-10,NATALIA>他那宝贝的直升机降落场
<17-10,NATALIA>His beloved helipad.

474
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,550
<17-10,NATALIA>六个月前他在自家后院建起来的
<17-10,NATALIA>He put the thing in his backyard six months ago.

475
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,990
<17-10,NATALIA>但是他想要做些变动
<17-10,NATALIA>But he needed a variance.

476
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,010
<17-10,NATALIA>我们上周批准同意了
<17-10,NATALIA>We approved it last week.

477
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,040
<17-10,NATALIA>之后  他就把我甩了
<17-10,NATALIA>Next thing you know, he dumps me.

478
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,380
<17-11,CASTLE>两个小时后他就被枪杀了
<17-11,CASTLE>Then he was shot and killed two hours later.

479
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,630
<17-12,NATALIA>那个时候我已经回到我的酒吧了
<17-12,NATALIA>Two hours later, I was back at my bar.

480
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,320
<17-12,NATALIA>我最后看见他是在海滩上
<17-12,NATALIA>Look, the last time I saw him was on that beach.

481
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,090
<17-12,NATALIA>当时我们正在争吵  他突然接到一条短信
<17-12,NATALIA>We were still arguing when he got a text

482
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,310
<17-12,NATALIA>然后就立马闪人了
<17-12,NATALIA>and he suddenly ran off.

483
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,830
<17-13,BECKETT>那时候是几点
<17-13,BECKETT>And what time was that?

484
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
<17-14,NATALIA>大约八点半
<17-14,NATALIA>About 8:30.

485
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,550
<17-15,CASTLE>他往哪去了
<17-15,CASTLE>Which way did he go?

486
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,330
<17-16,NATALIA>往海滩上方
<17-16,NATALIA>Up the beach.

487
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,950
<17-17,BRODY>先到这吧
<17-17,BRODY>Okay, then.

488
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,370
<18-1,RYAN>我查到了富兰克林离开罗斯福小姐前
<18-1,RYAN>So I tracked down that text that Franklin got

489
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,240
<18-1,RYAN>在海滩上收到的那条短信
<18-1,RYAN>before leaving Ms. Roosevelt on the beach.

490
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,410
<18-1,RYAN>看不到短信的内容
<18-1,RYAN>Couldn't get the content,

491
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,080
<18-1,RYAN>但是能确定是发自一部一次性手机
<18-1,RYAN>But it was sent from a burner phone.

492
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,170
<18-1,RYAN>发信息的人不想暴露身份
<18-1,RYAN>Whoever sent it wished to remain anonymous.

493
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,760
<18-2,ESPOSITO>可能是关于一些糟糕的生意
<18-2,ESPOSITO>Maybe it was about bad business deals.

494
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,440
<18-2,ESPOSITO>之前他们就是因为那些生意才陷入困境的
<18-2,ESPOSITO>That's what got him in trouble with his colleagues in the past.

495
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,420
<18-3,RYAN>他的过去还真是阴魂不散啊
<18-3,RYAN>The past does have a funny way of repeating itself.

496
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,800
<18-4,ESPOSITO>说到这个
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Speaking of which,

497
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,950
<18-4,ESPOSITO>我给盗窃组的熟人打了电话
<18-4,ESPOSITO>I have calls into my sources at robbery

498
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,300
<18-4,ESPOSITO>想看看贝克特是不是和老情人
<18-4,ESPOSITO>to try to link Beckett to her old beau--

499
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,770
<18-4,ESPOSITO>戴明探长有联系
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Detective Demming.

500
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,710
<18-4,ESPOSITO>戴明  别逗了
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Demming? Come on.

501
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,820
<19-1,CASTLE>贝克特能找到比他好得多的
<19-1,CASTLE>Beckett could do so much better.

502
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,900
<19-1,CASTLE>谢谢你们的汇报  我得挂了
<19-1,CASTLE>Uh, thank you for the update. I gotta go.

503
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,020
<19-2,BECKETT>你为什么要帮他们呢
<19-2,BECKETT>Why are you even helping them?

504
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,210
<19-3,CASTLE>好消息是
<19-3,CASTLE>Well, come on. The good news is,

505
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,730
<19-3,CASTLE>他们完完全全地被我们骗了
<19-3,CASTLE>they're completely fooled about us.

506
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,500
<19-4,BECKETT>我都不理解他们为什么那么八卦
<19-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I don't understand why they even care.

507
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,810
<19-5,CASTLE>是啊  为什么人们喜欢八卦布拉吉丽娜呢
<19-5,CASTLE>Ah, why do people care about Brangelina?

508
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,260
<19-6,BECKETT>我们现在成了布拉吉丽娜了
<19-6,BECKETT>Oh, so we're brangelina now?

509
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,990
<19-7,CASTLE>不不不  我们是理凯特
<19-7,CASTLE>No. No, no. We're... Rickate.

510
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,250
<19-8,CASTLE>不好  我们是  凯特克
<19-8,CASTLE>No, we're... Kate-ick.

512
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,850
<19-8,CASTLE>卡塞克特
<19-8,CASTLE>Cas-kett?

513
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,970
<19-9,CASTLE>这个好  凶杀案总是和棺材有关
<19-9,CASTLE>Ooh, that's good 'cause of the whole murder thing--casket.

514
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,540
<19-10,BECKETT>娜塔莉娅·罗斯福的不在场证据很充分
<19-10,BECKETT>So Natalia Roosevelt has a solid alibi.

515
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,430
<19-11,BRADY>她酒吧的三个老顾客确认了昨晚九点的时候
<19-11,BRADY>Three patrons of her bar confirmed she was there

516
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,760
<19-11,BRADY>她在酒吧里
<19-11,BRADY>9:00 last night.

517
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,830
<19-12,CASTLE>那时距离富兰克林被杀还有很长时间
<19-12,CASTLE>Long before Franklin was shot.

518
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,490
<19-13,BRADY>我派琼斯副警长沿着海滩
<19-13,BRADY>I got deputy Jones canvassing the houses along the beach

519
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,680
<19-13,BRADY>挨家挨户排查  就是富兰克林离开的那个方向
<19-13,BRADY>in the direction she said Franklin went.

520
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,610
<19-14,BECKETT>只有琼斯副警长吗
<19-14,BECKETT>Just deputy Jones?

521
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,660
<19-14,BECKETT>这是汉普顿
<19-14,BECKETT>It's the Hamptons.

522
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,350
<19-15,BRADY>我们没有太多的人手
<19-15,BRADY>We don't have a lot of resources.

523
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,690
<19-15,BRADY>对了  你们不是想看这个吗
<19-15,BRADY>Oh, by the way. I know you wanted to see this.

524
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,300
<19-15,BRADY>法医的尸检报告
<19-15,BRADY>It's the M.E. report.

525
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,230
<19-16,BECKETT>富兰克林的肺里充满了海水
<19-16,BECKETT>Uh, Franklin's lungs were full of saltwater.

526
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,870
<19-17,CASTLE>这意味着他差点淹死  这就怪了
<19-17,CASTLE>Meaning he almost drowned. That's strange.

527
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,160
<19-18,BRADY>还有  根据他枪伤的情况来看
<19-18,BRADY>And based on the condition of the gunshot wounds,

528
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,730
<19-18,BRADY>他在被击中后至少泡在海里20分钟
<19-18,BRADY>he was in the ocean at least 20 minutes after being shot.

529
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,220
<19-19,CASTLE>好的  这样的话
<19-19,CASTLE>Okay, so...

530
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,900
<19-19,CASTLE>在海里泡了20分钟
<19-19,CASTLE>In the ocean for 20 minutes,

531
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,840
<19-19,CASTLE>没人听到枪声
<19-19,CASTLE>no one heard the shots being...

532
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,500
<19-19,CASTLE>这就是没人听到枪声的原因
<19-19,CASTLE>that's why no one heard the shots.

533
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,700
<19-19,CASTLE>他被射击后掉下了船  《教父》风格
<19-19,CASTLE>He was shot off a boat, "Godfather" Style.

534
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,180
<19-20,BECKETT>海水减缓了他的出血量
<19-20,BECKETT>And the saltwater slowed down his bleeding,

535
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,830
<19-20,BECKETT>使他有足够的时间游上岸
<19-20,BECKETT>giving him enough time to make it to shore.

536
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,410
<19-21,BRADY>那么  我们是不是应该去查查
<19-21,BRADY>So what, we should try and figure out

537
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,570
<19-21,BRADY>案发时哪些船在那附近
<19-21,BRADY>which boats were in the vicinity at that time?

538
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,090
<19-21,BRADY>是的
<19-21,BRADY>Yeah. So...

539
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,340
<19-22,BECKETT>我们有没有证人昨晚在海滩上呢
<19-22,BECKETT>Do we have a witness who we know was on the beach last night?

540
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,170
<19-23,CASTLE>你是说
<19-23,CASTLE>You mean someone like...

541
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,770
<19-23,CASTLE>咱们的嗑药睡婴
<19-23,CASTLE>our favorite meth addict--

542
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,040
<19-23,CASTLE>麦克莫瑞
<19-23,CASTLE>Mcmurray?!

543
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
<19-23,CASTLE>没搞错吧
<19-23,CASTLE>Seriously?

544
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,940
<19-24,BRADY>那伙当时都嗨翻了
<19-24,BRADY>The guy was whacked out on meth.

545
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,570
<19-25,BECKETT>是的  但这并不意味着他忘了他所看见的事
<19-25,BECKETT>Yeah, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't remember what he saw.

546
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,610
<20-1,MCMURRY>是的  我看到了一艘船
<20-1,MCMURRY>Yeah, I saw a boat...

547
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,070
<20-1,MCMURRY>距离海岸大约100码
<20-1,MCMURRY>About 100 yards off the beach.

548
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,510
<20-2,CASTLE>很好  你能描述一下船的样子吗
<20-2,CASTLE>Okay, great. Can you describe it?

549
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,640
<20-2,CASTLE>比如大小
<20-2,CASTLE>Maybe it's size.

550
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,390
<20-3,MCMURRY>记不得了  我只记着那船当时正受到攻击
<20-3,MCMURRY>Nah. All I remember is, it was being attacked.

551
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,710
<20-4,BECKETT>攻击
<20-4,BECKETT>Attacked?

552
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,850
<20-5,MCMURRY>对  鲨鱼袭击
<20-5,MCMURRY>Yeah, by a shark.

553
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,570
<20-5,MCMURRY>一条红眼睛的红色鲨鱼
<20-5,MCMURRY>A red shark with red eyes.

554
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
<20-6,BECKETT>好吧  也许你说的没错
<20-6,BECKETT>Okay, maybe you are right about him.

555
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,970
<20-7,BRADY>也不一定
<20-7,BRADY>Maybe not.

556
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,150
<21-1,MARTY BENTLEY>对  我知道那船  就在那里
<21-1,MARTY BENTLEY>Yeah, I know that boat. It's just this way.

557
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,610
<21-1,MARTY BENTLEY>船主叫阿伦·勒纳
<21-1,MARTY BENTLEY>Owned by Aaron Lerner.

558
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,750
<21-2,CASTLE>阿伦·勒纳
<21-2,CASTLE>Aaron Lerner.

559
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,920
<21-3,BECKETT>那是被富兰克林送入监狱的其中一个
<21-3,BECKETT>That's one of the guys Franklin sent to prison.

560
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,110
<21-3,BECKETT>你是否知道那船昨晚有没有出航
<21-3,BECKETT>Do you know if that boat went out last night?

561
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,270
<21-4,BENTLEY>是  大概九点半左右我看见它离开
<21-4,BENTLEY>Yeah, I saw it pull away around 9:30.

562
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,270
<21-5,BRADY>那是富兰克林在海边
<21-5,BRADY>That's an hour after

563
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,050
<21-5,BRADY>离开娜塔莉娅·罗斯福的一小时以后
<21-5,BRADY>Franklin left Natalia Roosevelt on the beach.

564
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,400
<21-6,BECKETT>他有足够的时间赶到这里
<21-6,BECKETT>That's plenty of time for him to get here.

565
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,020
<21-7,CASTLE>如果船是在九点半起航
<21-7,CASTLE>If the boat left here by 9:30,

566
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,830
<21-7,CASTLE>那他就能轻松地在9:45掉进我家的游泳池
<21-7,CASTLE>it could've easily made it to the water off my house by 9:45.

567
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,150
<21-8,BECKETT>红色鲨鱼
<21-8,BECKETT>Red shark.

568
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,570
<21-9,CASTLE>鲨鱼袭击
<21-9,CASTLE>Shark attack.

569
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,400
<21-10,BENTLEY>小心脚下
<21-10,BENTLEY>Oh, watch your step. Ohh!

570
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,300
<21-12,BENTLEY>该死的周末船客
<21-12,BENTLEY>Damneded weekend boater.

571
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,910
<21-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  溅落的血迹
<21-13,BECKETT>Castle... Blood spatter.

572
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,940
<21-13,BECKETT>富兰克林就是在这里中枪的
<21-13,BECKETT>Franklin was shot right there.

573
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,320
<21-14,CASTLE>好啊  勒纳
<21-14,CASTLE>Hey, Lerner.

574
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,000
<21-14,CASTLE>凶手之船[双关: 船真赞]
<21-14,CASTLE>Killer boat.

575
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,060
<22-1,BECKETT>这是对我们在甲板上找到的
<22-1,BECKETT>It's the lab report on the blood splatter

576
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,570
<22-1,BECKETT>血迹的检验报告  勒纳先生
<22-1,BECKETT>we found on the deck, Mr. Lerner.

577
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,240
<22-1,BECKETT>与兰德尔·富兰克林的血样相同
<22-1,BECKETT>It's a match to Randall Franklin.

578
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,200
<22-2,CASTLE>也就是说他是在你船上中枪的
<22-2,CASTLE>Meaning he was shot on your boat.

579
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,760
<22-3,AARON LERNER>不  不可能  他根本就没上船
<22-3,AARON LERNER>No, that's not possible. He wasn't even on it.

580
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,960
<22-4,BRADY>那血迹是哪来的
<22-4,BRADY>How did it get there?

581
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,370
<22-5,LERNER>我也不知道
<22-5,LERNER>I have no idea.

582
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,670
<22-6,BECKETT>我们有证人看到你的船
<22-6,BECKETT>We have a witness who saw your boat

583
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,530
<22-6,BECKETT>于昨晚9:30离开码头
<22-6,BECKETT>leaving the marina at 9:30 last night.

584
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,570
<22-6,BECKETT>你去哪里了
<22-6,BECKETT>Where did you go?

585
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,910
<22-7,LERNER>我昨晚没有开船
<22-7,LERNER>I didn't take it out last night.

586
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,560
<22-7,LERNER>得了吧  勒纳
<22-7,LERNER>Lerner, come on.

587
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,780
<22-8,CASTLE>我们都知道兰德尔·富兰克林也跟你一样犯了法
<22-8,CASTLE>We know Randall Franklin was guilty of breaking

588
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,500
<22-8,CASTLE>但就因为他出卖了你
<22-8,CASTLE>all the same laws you broke, but he got off scot-free

589
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,580
<22-8,CASTLE>却被无罪释放
<22-8,CASTLE>because he ratted you out.

590
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,930
<22-8,CASTLE>你要给他点教训也是可以理解的
<22-8,CASTLE>It's understandable you'd want a little payback.

591
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,260
<22-9,LERNER>等等  没错  当然  我的确很愤怒
<22-9,LERNER>Wait. All right. Sure. Yeah, I held a grudge.

592
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,200
<22-9,LERNER>谁不会呢  但你们知道吗
<22-9,LERNER>Who wouldn't? But you know something?

593
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,080
<22-9,LERNER>几个月前  我在海边碰到他
<22-9,LERNER>I met him on the beach a few months ago,

594
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,390
<22-9,LERNER>我们和解了
<22-9,LERNER>and we buried the hatchet.

595
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,830
<22-9,LERNER>我甚至还去他家吃过几次饭
<22-9,LERNER>I've even had dinner at his house a couple times.

596
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,450
<22-10,BECKETT>那昨晚八点半到十点之间你到底在哪儿
<22-10,BECKETT>And exactly where were you 8:30 and 10:00 last night?

597
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,840
<22-11,LERNER>互助组
<22-11,LERNER>Group.

598
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,160
<22-11,LERNER>减肥互助组  怎么了
<22-11,LERNER>W--a weight-loss group at the rec. What?

599
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,120
<22-11,LERNER>听着  你们要想抓住杀害他的真凶
<22-11,LERNER>Look, you want to catch the guy who actually killed him,

600
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,800
<22-11,LERNER>就该去查查他的邻居
<22-11,LERNER>check out his neighbor.

601
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,650
<22-12,BECKETT>你说什么  他的邻居
<22-12,BECKETT>I'm sorry. His neighbor?

602
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:49,190
<22-13,LERNER>没错  那是个可怕的混蛋
<22-13,LERNER>Oh, yeah. This guy's a scary bastard.

603
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,190
<22-13,LERNER>上个礼拜  我在富兰克林家吃饭
<22-13,LERNER>I'm having dinner at Franklin's a week ago, right?

604
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,970
<22-13,LERNER>他邻居来了  死命地敲着大门
<22-13,LERNER>Neighbor comes over, starts banging on the front door.

605
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,230
<22-13,LERNER>富兰克林也不肯告诉我是怎么回事
<22-13,LERNER>Franklin wouldn't tell me what it was about,

606
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,190
<22-13,LERNER>不过那家伙是各种恐吓他
<22-13,LERNER>but this guy was threatening him with all kinds of violence.

607
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,960
<23-1,BRADY>好吧  谢谢
<23-1,BRADY>Okay, thanks.

608
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,680
<23-1,BRADY>好了  勒纳的不在场证明成立
<23-1,BRADY>Well... Lerner's alibi checks out.

609
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,000
<23-1,BRADY>他昨晚八点半到十点一直在减肥互助组
<23-1,BRADY>He was at the weight-loss group from 8:30 to 10:00 last night.

610
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,270
<23-2,CASTLE>也就是说有人开走了他的船
<23-2,CASTLE>Meaning someone else took out his boat,

611
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,090
<23-2,CASTLE>杀了富兰克林
<23-2,CASTLE>killed Franklin,

612
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,610
<23-2,CASTLE>在勒纳不知晓的情况下又把船开了回来
<23-2,CASTLE>and then brought it back without Lerner... Learning.

613
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,480
<23-3,BRADY>我叫琼斯再仔细查查码头
<23-3,BRADY>I'll have Jones canvass the marina.

614
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,250
<23-4,BECKETT>我们知道邻居是谁吗
<23-4,BECKETT>Meantime, do we know who this neighbor is?

615
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,290
<23-5,BRADY>知道  就是点财产纠纷
<23-5,BRADY>Yeah. It's just a property dispute.

616
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,820
<23-5,BRADY>在这里很常见
<23-5,BRADY>They're a dime a dozen around here.

617
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,240
<23-6,BECKETT>是啊  不过听勒纳的描述
<23-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but the way that Lerner describes it,

618
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,840
<23-6,BECKETT>事情似乎挺严重的
<23-6,BECKETT>it sounded like it was something pretty heated.

619
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,830
<23-7,BRADY>那邻居的脾气确实有点火爆
<23-7,BRADY>Well, the neighbor's a bit of a hothead,

620
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,950
<23-7,BRADY>但我告诉你
<23-7,BRADY>but, um, I'm telling you,

621
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,680
<23-7,BRADY>那不是谋杀的动机
<23-7,BRADY>it is not a motive for murder.

622
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,990
<23-8,CASTLE>我们至少应该找这个人谈谈吧
<23-8,CASTLE>Shouldn't we at least talk to this guy?

623
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,810
<23-9,BRADY>听好了  他可不是什么一般人
<23-9,BRADY>Okay, look, it's not just any guy.

624
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,640
<23-9,BRADY>他是文森特·卡达诺
<23-9,BRADY>It's vincent Cardano.

625
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,030
<23-10,CASTLE>卡达诺罪案家族的"疤头"文尼吗
<23-10,CASTLE>Vinnie "The scar" of the Cardano crime family?

626
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,060
<23-10,CASTLE>怪不得这船上枪杀的行径这么"教父"式
<23-10,CASTLE>That would explain the "Godfather" style of the boat shooting.

627
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,600
<23-10,CASTLE>我是他堂弟萨尔的朋友
<23-10,CASTLE>I'm friends with his cousin Sal.

628
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,410
<23-10,CASTLE>他一直想介绍我们认识来着
<23-10,CASTLE>He's been trying to get us together for years.

629
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,780
<23-11,BECKETT>此时不去更待何时
<23-11,BECKETT>And what better time than the present?

630
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,200
<23-11,BECKETT>我们可以把他带来问问他昨晚干了什么
<23-11,BECKETT>We could bring him over and ask him what he did last night.

631
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,080
<23-12,BRADY>不  不行
<23-12,BRADY>Whoa. Okay. No.

632
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,890
<23-12,BRADY>我不能凭白无故叫卡达诺来
<23-12,BRADY>I am not going at Cardano without proof.

633
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,740
<23-12,BRADY>我得走了
<23-12,BRADY>Look, I gotta run.

634
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,140
<23-12,BRADY>我得去给汉普顿桥杯
<23-12,BRADY>I gotta go reroute traffic

635
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,380
<23-12,BRADY>水球半决赛管管秩序
<23-12,BRADY>for the Bridgehamptons polo semifinals.

636
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,270
<23-12,BRADY>不过记住
<23-12,BRADY>But remember--

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,750
<23-12,BRADY>我们晚点再解决这事
<23-12,BRADY>We'll finish this later.

638
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,330
<23-12,BRADY>这里我说了算
<23-12,BRADY>I call the shots.

639
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,840
<23-12,BRADY>不许私自联系疤头文尼
<23-12,BRADY>No contacting Vinnie the scar.

640

<24-1,VINNIE>I'm sure that Sal told you I'm a big fan of your work.

645
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,510
<24-6,CASTLE>没错  这是棒极了  我不知道你居然还会做饭
<24-6,CASTLE>Actually, it is excellent. I didn't know you could cook.

646
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,600
<24-7,BECKETT>你该多留心  卡塞尔
<24-7,BECKETT>You should pay a little more attention, Castle.

647
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,860
<24-8,VINNIE>看见了吧  这就是我和卡塞尔的区别
<24-8,VINNIE>Ooh, see, that's the difference between Castle and me.

<24-8,VINNIE>亲爱的  自从我来到这里
<24-8,VINNIE>You've had my complete attention

<24-8,VINNIE>since I've been here, sweetheart.

650

<24-9,CASTLE>小心着点  文尼
<24-9,CASTLE>Whoa, whoa. Watch it, Vinnie.

651
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,800
<24-9,CASTLE>别逼着我做出像某人对你邻居做的事
<24-9,CASTLE>Don't make me have to do to you what someone did your neighbor.

652
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,320
<24-10,VINNIE>你也听说了吧
<24-10,VINNIE>Oh, you heard about that, huh?

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,410
<24-12,VINNIE>我可不会为他掉一滴眼泪
<24-12,VINNIE>I'm not gonna shed any tears over that guy.

656
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,650
<24-13,BECKETT>你认识他吗
<24-13,BECKETT>Oh, so you knew him, huh?

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,620
<24-14,VINNIE>那家伙是个混蛋
<24-14,VINNIE>Ah, the guy was a real bastard.

658
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,110
<24-14,VINNIE>他在他的花园里造了个直升机场地
<24-14,VINNIE>Uh, he builds a helicopter pad in his yard

659
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,690
<24-14,VINNIE>离我家都不到50英尺
<24-14,VINNIE>not 50 feet from my house.

660
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,150
<24-14,VINNIE>每周二半夜
<24-14,VINNIE>Every Tuesday around midnight,

661
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,000
<24-14,VINNIE>他都会轰隆隆地飞过我的卧室
<24-14,VINNIE>he buzzes right past my bedroom.

662
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,370
<24-15,CASTLE>真是混球
<24-15,CASTLE>The balls on that guy.

663
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,090
<24-16,VINNIE>是啊  所以我去投诉
<24-16,VINNIE>Yeah, so--so I complain,

664
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,790
<24-16,VINNIE>但市政会不管  他们批准的
<24-16,VINNIE>but the town council, they approve it anyway.

665
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,210
<24-16,VINNIE>我就知道他肯定给了他们好处
<24-16,VINNIE>I know for a fact that guy greased palms.

666
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,760
<24-16,VINNIE>真想杀了他
<24-16,VINNIE>Oh-ho, I wanted to kill him.

667
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,980
<24-17,CASTLE>我想也是
<24-17,CASTLE>I bet.

668
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,140
<24-17,CASTLE>得知他的死讯时你在哪儿
<24-17,CASTLE>So where were you when you found out about it?

669
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,970
<24-18,VINNIE>不知道  怎么了
<24-18,VINNIE>I don't know. What's it matter?

670
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,770
<24-19,CASTLE>你说  你想他死的人真死了
<24-19,CASTLE>Well, it's just, a guy you wanted killed ends up killed?

671
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,140
<24-19,CASTLE>这事能有多大概率
<24-19,CASTLE>How often does that happen?

672
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,890
<24-20,VINNIE>不知道
<24-20,VINNIE>I don't know.

673
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,400
<24-21,VINNIE>你想说什么  卡塞尔
<24-21,VINNIE>What are you saying, Castle?

674
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,520
<24-21,VINNIE>你以为是我杀了他
<24-21,VINNIE>You think I killed the guy?

675
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,660
<24-22,CASTLE>不  文尼  没有  我们就随便聊聊
<24-22,CASTLE>Well, n-no. Vinnie, no. We're just talking here.

<24-22,CASTLE>不  请坐  再来点酒吗
<24-22,CASTLE>No, sit down. Have some more wine.

00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,730
<24-23,VINNIE>不  我们吃完了
<24-23,VINNIE>No, we're finished here.

678
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,180
<24-23,VINNIE>坦白说  我很生气
<24-23,VINNIE>And frankly, I am offended that you think

679
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,550
<24-23,VINNIE>你居然会以为我会做出这么外行的事
<24-23,VINNIE>I would do such a bush-league hit.

680
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,100
<24-23,VINNIE>如果我想灭了他
<24-23,VINNIE>If I had whacked that guy,

681
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,550
<24-23,VINNIE>谁也别想找到尸体
<24-23,VINNIE>nobody'd ever find the body.

682
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,680
<24-24,VINNIE>别逼我给你做个示范
<24-24,VINNIE>Don't make me wanna do a demonstration.

683
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,680
<24-25,CASTLE>他说的有道理
<24-25,CASTLE>He makes a valid point.

684
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,560
<25-1,BECKETT>尸体  瘾君子  还有黑帮家族
<25-1,BECKETT>Dead bodies, meth heads, and mobsters--wow.

685
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,490
<25-1,BECKETT>这就是你所谓的浪漫周末吗
<25-1,BECKETT>Is that what you mean by a romantic weekend?

686
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,910
<25-2,CASTLE>我是不是该提醒你一下
<25-2,CASTLE>May I remind you that it was murder

687
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,000
<25-2,CASTLE>当初我们就是通过凶杀案相识的
<25-2,CASTLE>that brought us together in the first place?

688
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,120
<25-2,CASTLE>你好
<25-2,CASTLE>Hello.

689
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,280
<25-3,BRADY>我不是嘱咐过吗  卡塞尔
<25-3,BRADY>what did I tell you, Castle?

690
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
<25-3,BRADY>我说的清清楚楚  不要联系卡达诺
<25-3,BRADY>I was crystal clear. I said no contacting Cardano!

691
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,660
<25-4,CASTLE>什么  我们就友好地吃了个饭而已
<25-4,CASTLE>What? Oh, that was just a friendly meal.

692
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,290
<25-4,CASTLE>而且  我们还剩了点意大利面
<25-4,CASTLE>Actually, we have some linguine left

693
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,190
<25-4,CASTLE>你可以过来一起啊
<25-4,CASTLE>If you'd like to come over.

694
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,610
<25-5,BRADY>你们指控他谋杀
<25-5,BRADY>You accused him of murder!

695
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,940
<25-5,BRADY>而且他觉得是我让你们这么干的
<25-5,BRADY>And now he thinks I put you up to it.

696
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,420
<25-6,CASTLE>好的一面是我们可以确定他不是疑犯
<25-6,CASTLE>On the bright side, we can rule him out as a suspect.

697
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,640
<25-7,BRADY>他从来就是不是疑犯
<25-7,BRADY>He was never a suspect in the first place.

698
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,780
<25-8,CASTLE>总而言之
<25-8,CASTLE>Bottom line is,

699
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,080
<25-8,CASTLE>凶手还逍遥法外
<25-8,CASTLE>The killer's still out there.

700
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,610
<25-9,BRADY>别扯了  总而言之就是经过你们一折腾
<25-9,BRADY>No. No, no, no. The bottom line is that after what you just pulled,

701
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,090
<25-9,BRADY>我还是自己找凶手
<25-9,BRADY>I will find him myself,

702
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,260
<25-9,BRADY>不用你们帮忙了
<25-9,BRADY>without any more of your help.

703
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,010
<25-10,CASTLE>听着  警长
<25-10,CASTLE>Look, Chief--

704
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,420
<25-11,BRADY>要是我发现你们再碰这个案子  我发誓
<25-11,BRADY>And if I catch you guys anywhere near this case again, I swear...

705
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,280
<25-11,BRADY>我亲自把你们请出这里
<25-11,BRADY>I will out the two of you.

706
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,410
<25-12,BECKETT>我猜他不过来吃面了呗
<25-12,BECKETT>So I guess it's a "No" on the linguine.

707
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,770
<25-13,CASTLE>嗯  他说他已经吃过了
<25-13,CASTLE>No. He, uh... said he already ate.

708
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,110
<25-13,CASTLE>走吧
<25-13,CASTLE>Shall we?

709
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,850
<26-1,RYAN>我仔细查了查
<26-1,RYAN>Hey. So I took a closer look

710
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,860
<26-1,RYAN>兰德尔·富兰克林房地产投资
<26-1,RYAN>at Randall Franklin's real estate investments.

711
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,640
<26-1,RYAN>这家伙在萧条的社区里
<26-1,RYAN>The guy was buying up distressed properties

712
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,430
<26-1,RYAN>买下了一堆困厄房产并改造成公寓
<26-1,RYAN>in dying neighborhoods and turning 'em into condos.

713
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,870
<26-2,ESPOSITO>听起来是个不错的投资啊
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Sounds like smart investments.

714
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,580
<26-3,RYAN>是啊  但是他没有装修
<26-3,RYAN>Yeah, but he wasn't renovating 'em.

715
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,490
<26-3,RYAN>也没有出租  什么都没干
<26-3,RYAN>He wasn't leasing 'em out, nothing.

716
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,840
<26-4,ESPOSITO>所以说他还在承担着按揭
<26-4,ESPOSITO>So he was carrying the mortgage,

717
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,800
<26-4,ESPOSITO>可是房子并没有盈利
<26-4,ESPOSITO>but the buildings weren't throwing off any income?

718
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,210
<26-5,RYAN>他的妻子说
<26-5,RYAN>And his wife said that

719
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,020
<26-5,RYAN>房地产投资让他们狠赚了一笔
<26-5,RYAN>the real estate investments were keeping them flush.

720
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,000
<26-5,RYAN>这说不通啊
<26-5,RYAN>It doesn't add up.

721
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,120
<26-5,RYAN>对啊
<26-5,RYAN>You're right.

722
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,550
<26-6,ESPOSITO>房子里一定有蹊跷
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Has to be something going on in those buildings.

723
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,310
<26-7,RYAN>只有一个办法可以知道
<26-7,RYAN>Only one way to find out.

724
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,230
<27-1,ESPOSITO>富兰克林绝对
<27-1,ESPOSITO>ugh. Franklin definitely

725
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,510
<27-1,ESPOSITO>一个子都没花在装修这鬼地方上
<27-1,ESPOSITO>didn't put any money into renovating this dump.

726
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,290
<27-2,RYAN>这地方是废弃的
<27-2,RYAN>Place is deserted.

727
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,190
<27-2,RYAN>他绝对没在这儿赚到钱
<27-2,RYAN>He's definitely not making any money here.

728
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,830
<27-3,ESPOSITO>-那到底从哪里赚的  -我也不知道
<27-3,ESPOSITO>- Yeah, so where's it coming from? - I don't know.

729
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,620
<27-4,ESPOSITO>不是吧
<27-4,ESPOSITO>Really?

730
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,870
<27-5,RYAN>你现在看短信
<27-5,RYAN>You're checking your text messages right now?

731
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,320
<27-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特的事  哥们儿
<27-6,ESPOSITO>It's about Beckett, bro.

732
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,710
<27-6,ESPOSITO>她没和戴明在一起
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Ah! She's not with Demming.

733
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,770
<27-6,ESPOSITO>劫案组的莫拉莱斯说他和一个副警探约会
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Morales in robbery says that he's been dating a vice detective...

734
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,380
<27-6,ESPOSITO>有四个月了
<27-6,ESPOSITO>for the last four months.

735
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:11,060
<27-7,RYAN>听见了吗
<27-7,RYAN>You hear that?

736
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,890
<27-8,ESPOSITO>听见了
<27-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

737
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,600
<27-9,ESPOSITO>我真不喜欢这事  哥们儿
<27-9,ESPOSITO>I don't like this, bro.

738
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,870
<27-10,RYAN>我也一样
<27-10,RYAN>No, me neither.

739
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,910
<27-11,RYAN>我们不会敲门的
<27-11,RYAN>No way we're knocking on that door.

740
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,860
<27-12,ESPOSITO>房子的主人死了
<27-12,ESPOSITO>Okay. Well, the building owner's dead,

741
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,460
<27-12,ESPOSITO>老婆也接受了调查  所以
<27-12,ESPOSITO>and the wife is down with us investigating, so...

742
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,130
<27-13,ESPOSITO>纽约警局
<27-13,ESPOSITO>NYPD!

743
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,790
<27-14,RYAN>靠墙站  快点
<27-14,RYAN>Up against the wall right now! Move!

744
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,670
<27-14,RYAN>靠墙  靠墙
<27-14,RYAN>Move! Move! Move!

745
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,470
<27-14,RYAN>靠墙  靠墙
<27-14,RYAN>Move it! Move it! Move it!

746
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,120
<27-15,RYAN>看起来富兰克林找到
<27-15,RYAN>Looks like Franklin found a way

747
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,980
<27-15,RYAN>换钱的好方法了
<27-15,RYAN>to monetize his investment after all--

748
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,390
<27-15,RYAN>制造毒品
<27-15,RYAN>Making crank.

749
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,900
<27-16,ESPOSITO>是啊  这绝对是个制毒厂
<27-16,ESPOSITO>Yeah. This is definitely a meth lab.

750
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,830
<28-1,BECKETT>所以说富兰克林是个毒品贩子
<28-1,BECKETT>So Franklin was a meth kingpin, huh?

751
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,560
<28-2,CASTLE>事实证明他所有的地产
<28-2,CASTLE>Turns out, all of his properties

752
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,990
<28-2,CASTLE>都有制毒厂
<28-2,CASTLE>Housed meth labs,

753
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,820
<28-2,CASTLE>不过这对一个以前制假帐的人来说
<28-2,CASTLE>which makes sense for someone who...

754
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,870
<28-2,CASTLE>是绝对说得通的
<28-2,CASTLE>used to cook the books.

755
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,350
<28-3,BECKETT>这就是他被杀的原因
<28-3,BECKETT>That's why he was killed.

756
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,710
<28-3,BECKETT>毕竟是个危险的行当
<28-3,BECKETT>It's a dangerous business.

757
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,270
<28-4,CASTLE>现在的工作可以交给纽约方面了
<28-4,CASTLE>Well, it's all about New York now.

758
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,840
<28-4,CASTLE>-他俩接手了  -对
<28-4,CASTLE>- The boys can take it from here... - Yeah.

759
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,190
<28-4,CASTLE>我们也可以继续这事找上我们之前
<28-4,CASTLE>and we can pick up right where we left off

760
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,840
<28-4,CASTLE>没干完的事了
<28-4,CASTLE>before this whole thing came to us.

761
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,440
<28-6,BECKETT>是啊  不过  为什么找上我们
<28-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but... Why did it come to us?

762
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,380
<28-7,CASTLE>这世界还挺幽默的  我觉得
<28-7,CASTLE>Uh... The universe has a sense of humor, I suppose.

763
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,110
<28-8,BECKETT>不不不  我是说如果和毒品有关
<28-8,BECKETT>No, no, I mean, if this is about meth,

764
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,250
<28-8,BECKETT>他为什么没在纽约被杀
<28-8,BECKETT>then why wasn't he killed in New York?

765
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,580
<28-9,CASTLE>没准凶手喜欢沙滩
<28-9,CASTLE>Maybe the killer likes the beach.

766
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,750
<28-10,BECKETT>不  我觉得这背后还有隐情  卡塞尔
<28-10,BECKETT>No, I think there's gotta be more to it, Castle.

767
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,840
<28-10,BECKETT>他们知道勒纳的船
<28-10,BECKETT>I mean, they knew about Lerner's boat.

768
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,910
<28-11,CASTLE>你猜怎么着  我觉得他们一定能查出来
<28-11,CASTLE>You know what? I'm sure the boys will figure it out.

769
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,310
<28-12,BECKETT>这就需要了解富兰克林的生活
<28-12,BECKETT>And that requires an intimate knowledge about Franklin's life.

770
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,630
<28-12,BECKETT>这是本地人知道的事
<28-12,BECKETT>That's local knowledge.

771
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,380
<28-13,CASTLE>对  对  对
<28-13,CASTLE>Right, right, right.

772
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,370
<28-13,CASTLE>没准杀手认真研究了
<28-13,CASTLE>Well, maybe the killer just did his homework.

773
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,160
<28-14,BECKETT>对  但是为什么他们要费那么大劲呢
<28-14,BECKETT>Yeah, but why would they go to all of that trouble?

774
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,050
<28-14,BECKETT>如果他是纽约的毒贩子
<28-14,BECKETT>I mean, if he was a kingpin in New York city,

775
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,830
<28-14,BECKETT>为什么他们在这里把他杀了
<28-14,BECKETT>Why would they kill him out here?

776
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,850
<28-15,CASTLE>除非有一部分的生意是在这里进行的
<28-15,CASTLE>Unless part of the drug business was out here.

777
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,500
<28-16,BECKETT>这就解释了直升机
<28-16,BECKETT>That explains the helicopter.

778
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,730
<28-16,BECKETT>他需要直升机把毒品转移这里
<28-16,BECKETT>He needed the helicopter to transfer the drugs out here.

779
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,030
<28-17,CASTLE>这就是他和娜塔莉娅鬼混  还贿赂她的原因
<28-17,CASTLE>And why he slept with Natalia and greased palms.

780
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,370
<28-18,BECKETT>他需要取得直升机场的使用批准
<28-18,BECKETT>He needed approval to get the helipad.

781
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,640
<28-19,CASTLE>是  用直升机转移毒品
<28-19,CASTLE>Yes, much less risky to move your product in a helicopter

782
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,700
<28-19,CASTLE>可比船和车安全多了
<28-19,CASTLE>rather than boat or car.

783
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,080
<28-19,CASTLE>没有警察会叫你停下来
<28-19,CASTLE>No cop is gonna pull you over.

784
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,600
<28-20,BECKETT>布雷迪警长说这里的毒品问题
<28-20,BECKETT>You know, Chief Brady said that the drug problem

785
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,930
<28-20,BECKETT>在过去六个月猛增了一倍
<28-20,BECKETT>has doubled over the past six months.

786
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,340
<28-21,CASTLE>而这正是富兰克林开始用直升机的时间
<28-21,CASTLE>Exactly when Franklin started using his helicopter.

787
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,400
<28-22,BECKETT>对不起  卡塞尔  我觉得你应该
<28-22,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Castle. But I think you should probably...

788
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,680
<28-23,CASTLE>给莱恩和埃斯波西托打电话了
<28-23,CASTLE>Call Ryan and Esposito.

789
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,580
<28-23,CASTLE>是啊
<28-23,CASTLE>Yeah.

790
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,280
<29-1,RYAN>看来卡塞尔是对的
<29-1,RYAN>Looks like Castle was right.

791
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,350
<29-1,RYAN>直升机飞行安排
<29-1,RYAN>His helicopter's flight plans coincide

792
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,040
<29-1,RYAN>与制毒厂出货时间吻合
<29-1,RYAN>with when the shipments left the meth labs.

793
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,050
<29-2,ESPOSITO>也与他邻居抱怨的
<29-2,ESPOSITO>They also coincide with the late-night landings

794
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,700
<29-2,ESPOSITO>夜晚降落时间吻合
<29-2,ESPOSITO>that his neighbor was complaining about.

795
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,600
<29-2,ESPOSITO>现在我们知道富兰克林转移毒品的原因了
<29-2,ESPOSITO>So now we know how Franklin was moving his product.

796
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,930
<29-2,ESPOSITO>但是还是没有告诉我们凶手是谁
<29-2,ESPOSITO>But it still doesn't tell us who killed him.

797
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,510
<29-3,RYAN>或许能  你去哪里
<29-3,RYAN>Well, maybe it does, but where are you going?

798
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,880
<29-4,ESPOSITO>见个以前的联调局的哥们儿
<29-4,ESPOSITO>To meet an FBI buddy of mine

799
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,030
<29-4,ESPOSITO>看看贝克特是不是和老情人索伦森复合了
<29-4,ESPOSITO>to see if Beckett's back with her old flame Sorenson.

800
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,620
<29-4,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<29-4,ESPOSITO>Why?

801
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,450
<29-5,RYAN>周二的货单中
<29-5,RYAN>The flight manifest for Tuesday--

802
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,400
<29-5,RYAN>还顺道送了个客人
<29-5,RYAN>it includes a guest.

803
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,470
<29-5,RYAN>有人和他在一起
<29-5,RYAN>Someone else was with him.

804
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,970
<29-6,ESPOSITO>好吧  我查索伦森  你查直升机小子
<29-6,ESPOSITO>All right, I'm on sorenson. You go get helicopter boy.

805
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,810
<30-1,LERNER>我就坐了次富兰克林的直升机
<30-1,LERNER>So I got a ride on Franklin's helicopter.

806
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,720
<30-1,LERNER>怎么了
<30-1,LERNER>So what?

807
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,430
<30-2,LAWYER>这也无法证明我的委托人一起运毒
<30-2,LAWYER>That doesn't prove my client was trafficking drugs with him.

808
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,470
<30-3,RYAN>是  但是这些能证明
<30-3,RYAN>True. These do.

809
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,390
<30-3,RYAN>制毒厂工人的签字申请
<30-3,RYAN>Signed affidavits from the meth lab workers

810
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,900
<30-3,RYAN>说明你每周二都去提货  勒纳
<30-3,RYAN>that you picked up product every Tuesday, Lerner.

811
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,750
<30-3,RYAN>你从银行业转行到制毒业
<30-3,RYAN>You went from making bank to making crank.

812
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,450
<30-4,LERNER>我没杀富兰克林
<30-4,LERNER>I didn't kill Franklin.

813
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,830
<30-4,LERNER>而且布雷迪警长已经证实了我在汉普顿的
<30-4,LERNER>A-and Chief Brady already confirmed my alibi

814
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,540
<30-4,LERNER>不在场证明
<30-4,LERNER>In the Hamptons.

815
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,930
<30-5,RYAN>没准你雇凶杀人
<30-5,RYAN>Well, maybe you hired someone to kill him.

816
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,940
<30-5,RYAN>我觉得你一直对富兰克林怀恨在心
<30-5,RYAN>See, I think you never got over your grudge against Franklin.

817
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,080
<30-5,RYAN>我认为你和他合伙
<30-5,RYAN>I think that you partnered with him,

818
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,720
<30-5,RYAN>但你却一直打算将他赶走
<30-5,RYAN>but you always planned to knock him off

819
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,950
<30-5,RYAN>然后接手全部生意  我说得对吗
<30-5,RYAN>and take over the business. Am I getting close?

820
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,330
<30-6,LERNER>对  对  你说得很对  但是你搞错人了
<30-6,LERNER>Yeah, yeah, you're close, but you just got the wrong guy.

821
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,230
<30-7,RYAN>什么意思
<30-7,RYAN>What do you mean?

822
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,860
<30-8,LERNER>就在上周  富兰克林在抱怨一个当地人
<30-8,LERNER>Just last week, Franklin was complaining about a local.

823
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,930
<30-9,RYAN>当地毒贩吗
<30-9,RYAN>A local drug dealer?

824
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,800
<30-10,LERNER>没错  似乎他对我们抢他生意很不满意
<30-10,LERNER>Yes. Seems he didn't appreciate us moving in on his business.

825
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,910
<30-11,RYAN>谁  说出名字
<30-11,RYAN>Who? Give me a name.

826
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,890
<30-12,LERNER>我不知道名字
<30-12,LERNER>I don't know a name,

827
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,500
<30-12,LERNER>但是富兰克林很怕他
<30-12,LERNER>but Franklin seemed really spooked.

828
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,420
<30-13,RYAN>他还跟你说了什么
<30-13,RYAN>What else did he tell you about him?

829
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,600
<30-14,LERNER>我只知道这么多
<30-14,LERNER>That's all I know.

830
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,070
<30-14,LERNER>其他一切我都告诉了布雷迪和他的两个顾问
<30-14,LERNER>Everything else I told to Brady and his two consultants.

831
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,460
<30-15,RYAN>两个顾问
<30-15,RYAN>Two consultants?

832
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,240
<30-16,LERNER>是啊  那个作家卡塞尔和他的女朋友
<30-16,LERNER>Yeah, yeah, the writer Castle and his girlfriend.

833
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,260
<30-17,RYAN>女朋友  你说什么女朋友
<30-17,RYAN>Girlfriend? Wh-wh-what do you mean, girlfriend?

834
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,130
<30-18,LERNER>这很重要吗
<30-18,LERNER>What does that matter?

835
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,660
<30-19,RYAN>伙计  在这里只有我能问问题
<30-19,RYAN>Hey! Hey! I'll ask the questions here, pal.

836
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,600
<30-19,RYAN>你是说理查德·卡塞尔在审问时
<30-19,RYAN>Are you telling me that Richard Castle

837
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,420
<30-19,RYAN>带着他的女朋友吗
<30-19,RYAN>brought his girlfriend in your interrogation?

838
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,000
<30-20,LERNER>是啊
<30-20,LERNER>Yeah.

839
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,690
<30-21,RYAN>她叫什么
<30-21,RYAN>What was her name?

840
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,540
<30-22,LERNER>我不记得
<30-22,LERNER>I don't remember.

841
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,910
<30-23,RYAN>那描述一下
<30-23,RYAN>Well, then describe her.

842
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,510
<30-23,RYAN>勒纳  描述一下她  快点
<30-23,RYAN>Describe her, Lerner! Now!

843
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,070
<30-24,LERNER>好吧  高高的  中长发
<30-24,LERNER>Okay! Tall, uh, uh, medium length hair.

844
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,990
<30-24,LERNER>这是要干嘛
<30-24,LERNER>What's this about?

845
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,600
<30-25,RYAN>什么颜色  头发什么颜色
<30-25,RYAN>What color? G-give me a hair color.

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,990
<30-26,LERNER>棕色
<30-26,LERNER>Uh, uh, brown.

847
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,410
<30-26,LERNER>棕色  我想眼睛也是棕色  很漂亮
<30-26,LERNER>Brown. Brown eyes, too, I think. Really pretty.

848
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,270
<30-27,RYAN>体型呢
<30-27,RYAN>Body type?

849
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,100
<30-28,LERNER>棒极了  真的棒极了
<30-28,LERNER>Awesome. I mean, awesome.

850
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,420
<30-28,LERNER>她  苗条  美死了...  她很热辣
<30-28,LERNER>She was, like, thin, gorge-- she was hot.

851
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,560
<30-28,LERNER>非常热辣
<30-28,LERNER>She was really hot.

852
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,580
<30-28,LERNER>凯特
<30-28,LERNER>Kate!

853
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,870
<30-28,LERNER>名叫凯特
<30-28,LERNER>Name was Kate!

854
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,530
<30-29,RYAN>混...
<30-29,RYAN>Son of a...

855
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,200
<31-1,RYAN>你是对的  卡塞尔
<31-1,RYAN>You were right, Castle.

856
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,940
<31-1,RYAN>富兰克林利用自己的直升飞机
<31-1,RYAN>Franklin was using his helicopter

857
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,160
<31-1,RYAN>将毒品运到汉普顿
<31-1,RYAN>to move meth to the Hamptons.

858
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,430
<31-1,RYAN>看起来你让案子有了大进展
<31-1,RYAN>Looks like you blew this case wide open.

859
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,210
<31-1,RYAN>我想现在你又能重新专注写作了吧
<31-1,RYAN>Guess you can get back to your writing now, huh?

860
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,040
<31-2,CASTLE>还是要找出到底凶手是谁
<31-2,CASTLE>Well, there's still the matter of finding out who the killer is.

861
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,530
<31-3,RYAN>是的  我觉得布雷迪知道自己要做什么
<31-3,RYAN>Yeah, well, I think Brady knows what he has to do.

862
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,470
<31-3,RYAN>我已经告诉他去找一个当地毒贩
<31-3,RYAN>I already told him to look for a local drug dealer

863
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,570
<31-3,RYAN>会因富兰克林的扩张计划
<31-3,RYAN>who would've been feeling squeezed

864
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,710
<31-3,RYAN>受到排挤
<31-3,RYAN>by Franklin's expanding operation.

865
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,340
<31-4,CASTLE>这个想法不错  干得漂亮
<31-4,CASTLE>Well, that's a great theory. Nice work.

866
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,380
<31-5,RYAN>谢了  不过
<31-5,RYAN>Oh, thanks, but, uh,

867
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,010
<31-5,RYAN>这不是我的理论
<31-5,RYAN>it's not my theory.

868
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,030
<31-5,RYAN>今天早上我审讯
<31-5,RYAN>Aaron Lerner gave it up

869
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,380
<31-5,RYAN>阿伦·勒纳的时候  他提出的
<31-5,RYAN>when I interrogated him this morning.

870
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,910
<31-5,RYAN>阿伦·勒纳
<31-5,RYAN>Aaron lerner? Aar--uh...

871
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,890
<31-6,CASTLE>你也审讯过阿伦·勒纳了
<31-6,CASTLE>So you interrogated Aaron Lerner, too?

872
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,670
<31-7,RYAN>是的  他回来了
<31-7,RYAN>Yeah, he's back in the city.

873
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,960
<31-7,RYAN>而且他还是富兰克林的犯罪同伙
<31-7,RYAN>Turns out he was Franklin's partner in crime.

874
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,620
<31-8,CASTLE>你了解了什么
<31-8,CASTLE>Wow. What do you know?

875
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,760
<31-8,CASTLE>卡塞尔  不好了
<31-8,CASTLE>Castle, not good.

876
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,540
<31-8,CASTLE>知道  别紧张
<31-8,CASTLE>I know. Relax.

877
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,780
<31-9,RYAN>-别紧张  -我怎么能不紧张
<31-9,RYAN>- Relax? - How can I relax?

878
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,670
<31-9,RYAN>卡塞尔  你在听吗
<31-9,RYAN>You still there, Castle?

879
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,730
<31-10,CASTLE>在的  还在
<31-10,CASTLE>Yeah. Still here.

880
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,050
<31-11,CASTLE>阿伦·勒纳还说了什么
<31-11,CASTLE>Uh, what else did Aaron Lerner say?

881
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,880
<31-11,CASTLE>他有没有什么有关...  说些其他的
<31-11,CASTLE>Did he say anything else about... Anything else?

882
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,710
<31-12,RYAN>你懂的  和平时一样
<31-12,RYAN>Oh, you know, the usual.

883
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,690
<31-12,RYAN>"不是我干的
<31-12,RYAN>"I didn't do it,

884
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,560
<31-12,RYAN>你们抓错人了"
<31-12,RYAN>you got the wrong guy."

885
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,950
<31-12,RYAN>-他把知道的一切都告诉我了  -一切
<31-12,RYAN>- I'm pretty sure he told me everything he knows. - Everything?

886
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,100
<31-14,CASTLE>一切吗
<31-14,CASTLE>Everything, huh?

887
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,730
<31-14,CASTLE>很好
<31-14,CASTLE>That's good.

888
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,300
<31-15,RYAN>是啊
<31-15,RYAN>Yeah.

889
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,840
<31-16,CASTLE>写作顺利
<31-16,CASTLE>Good luck with the writing.

890
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,150
<31-16,CASTLE>谢谢
<31-16,CASTLE>Thanks.

891
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,230
<32-1,CASTLE>布雷迪警长  我做了什么吗
<32-1,CASTLE>Chief Brady. What did I do now?

892
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,170
<32-1,CASTLE>没什么
<32-1,CASTLE>Nothing.

893
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,440
<32-2,BRADY>我只是想告诉你们
<32-2,BRADY>Uh, I just wanted to let you know,

894
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,520
<32-2,BRADY>我和莱恩警探通过电话了
<32-2,BRADY>I talked to detective Ryan.

895
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,900
<32-3,BECKETT>真的吗  那么  他说了什么
<32-3,BECKETT>Really? So... What did he say?

896
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,610
<32-4,BRADY>他让我们去查查一个当地的毒贩
<32-4,BRADY>Well, he got us on to the idea of a local drug dealer.

897
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,720
<32-4,BRADY>所以我们找海滩边吸毒男麦克莫瑞谈了谈
<32-4,BRADY>So we talked to Mcmurray-- the meth addict from the beach--

898
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,350
<32-4,BRADY>他抖出了当地毒品的供应者
<32-4,BRADY>And he coughed up the name of the local supplier of meth.

899
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,770
<32-4,BRADY>马蒂·本特利
<32-4,BRADY>Marty Bentley.

900
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,140
<32-5,CASTLE>那个码头运营商
<32-5,CASTLE>The marina operator?

901
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,310
<32-6,BECKETT>对  但这样说得通
<32-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but that makes sense.

902
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,770
<32-6,BECKETT>这样他就知道阿伦·勒纳的安排
<32-6,BECKETT>I mean, he would know aaron lerner's schedule

903
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,860
<32-6,BECKETT>知道他什么时候出航
<32-6,BECKETT>and when he could take the boat out.

904
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,500
<32-6,BECKETT>没错
<32-6,BECKETT>Right.

905
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,370
<32-7,BRADY>所以我们申请了搜查令去搜查他家
<32-7,BRADY>So we got a warrant to search his apartment

906
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,680
<32-7,BRADY>找到了给富兰克林发短信叫他去码头的
<32-7,BRADY>and found the burner cell phone that sent the text

907
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,250
<32-7,BRADY>一次性手机
<32-7,BRADY>summoning Franklin to the marina.

908
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,030
<32-7,BRADY>很好
<32-7,BRADY>Good.

909
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,190
<32-8,CASTLE>很好  恭喜了
<32-8,CASTLE>Well, that's great. Congrats.

910
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,480
<32-9,BRADY>谢了  如果没有你们和你们在纽约的资源
<32-9,BRADY>Thanks. Hey, I couldn't have done it without the two of you

911
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,910
<32-9,BRADY>我没法破了这个案子
<32-9,BRADY>and your resources in New York.

912
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,180
<32-9,BRADY>如果你们能一起去逮捕他  我会很荣幸的
<32-9,BRADY>Um... I'd be honored if you came to the arrest.

913
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,130
<32-10,BECKETT>不去
<32-10,BECKETT>No.

914
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,350
<32-11,CASTLE>我们怎么能说不呢
<32-11,CASTLE>Well, how can we say no?

915
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,640
<32-12,BRADY>警察  趴下
<32-12,BRADY>Police! Down! Get down!

916
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,900
<32-12,BRADY>警察  警察
<32-12,BRADY>Police! Police!

917
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,570
<32-13,CASTLE>布雷迪警长第一次掏枪
<32-13,CASTLE>So chief Brady's first time pulling his gun.

918
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,360
<32-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  也许我该进去
<32-14,BECKETT>Oh, Castle. Maybe I should go in there.

919
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,330
<32-15,CASTLE>你没带枪
<32-15,CASTLE>You don't have a gun.

920
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,510
<32-16,BECKETT>是啊  不过你也总是不带枪乱闯
<32-16,BECKETT>Yeah, but that never stops you.

921
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,710
<32-17,CASTLE>我很幸运
<32-17,CASTLE>Well, I'm lucky.

922
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,120
<32-18,BRADY>我们抓到他了
<32-18,BRADY>We got him.

923
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,950
<32-20,BRADY>船舱安全了
<32-20,BRADY>Cabin secured.

924
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,770
<32-21,BECKETT>布雷迪警长  干得漂亮
<32-21,BECKETT>Nice one, chief Brady.

925
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,430
<32-22,BRADY>-谢谢你  探长  -不客气
<32-22,BRADY>- Thank you, detective. - Yeah.

926
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,410
<32-24,BRADY>感觉和你书中的故事一样吧  卡塞尔
<32-24,BRADY>Just like out of one of your books, huh, Castle?

927
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,870
<32-25,CASTLE>对   码头运营商兼职毒贩
<32-25,CASTLE>Yeah. Uh, marina owner with side meth business

928
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,470
<32-25,CASTLE>杀死竞争对手
<32-25,CASTLE>kills competition.

929
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,320
<32-25,CASTLE>命名《汉普顿希特》  如果我要写的话
<32-25,CASTLE>Call it "Hamptons Heat," and if I ever write it,

930
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,480
<32-25,CASTLE>我确定会加入勇敢的布雷迪警长一角
<32-25,CASTLE>I'll be sure to include a gutsy chief Brady character.

931
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,860
<32-26,MARTY BENTLEY>那不是我的
<32-26,MARTY BENTLEY>That's not mine.

932
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,380
<32-26,MARTY BENTLEY>听着  我告诉你们  我什么也没做
<32-26,MARTY BENTLEY>Look, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.

933
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,590
<32-26,MARTY BENTLEY>你们抓错人了
<32-26,MARTY BENTLEY>You got the wrong guy.

934
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,000
<32-27,DEPUTY JONES>警长  目前我就找到几袋毒品
<32-27,DEPUTY JONES>Chief, so far I found baggies of meth

935
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,170
<32-27,DEPUTY JONES>和一把点30的卡宾枪
<32-27,DEPUTY JONES>and an automag iii .30 carbine.

936
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,360
<32-28,BECKETT>这枪是30口径的子弹
<32-28,BECKETT>Which shoots 30-caliber bullets

937
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,160
<32-28,BECKETT>和我们在死者身上取出的子弹一致
<32-28,BECKETT>just like the ones that we pulled out of our victim.

938
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,490
<32-28,BECKETT>这就是凶器
<32-28,BECKETT>That's our murder weapon.

939
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,610
<32-29,BRADY>我想这样可以结案了  干得好  副警长
<32-29,BRADY>Well, I guess that seals it. Good--good work, deputy.

940
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,200
<32-30,BENTLEY>太荒谬了
<32-30,BENTLEY>This is ridiculous.

941
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,100
<32-30,BENTLEY>我没杀人  你们抓错人了
<32-30,BENTLEY>I didn't kill anybody. You got the wrong guy.

942
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,660
<32-31,OFFICER>是啊  是啊
<32-31,OFFICER>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

943
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,200
<32-31,OFFICER>看着脚下
<32-31,OFFICER>Watch your step.

944
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,560
<32-32,CASTLE>警官  等一下
<32-32,CASTLE>Officer, hold on a second there.

945
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,750
<32-33,BRADY>怎么了  卡塞尔
<32-33,BRADY>What is it, Castle?

946
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,800
<32-34,CASTLE>这个结
<32-34,CASTLE>This knot.

947
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,820
<32-34,CASTLE>这边两个结
<32-34,CASTLE>Both of these knots.

948
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,120
<32-34,CASTLE>这是一个完美的八字形结
<32-34,CASTLE>That's a perfect figure eight with an underhand,

949
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,690
<32-34,CASTLE>干净利落  这是你系的吗  本特利
<32-34,CASTLE>neatly flemished. Did you tie these, Bentley?

950
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,390
<32-35,BENTLEY>当然  那是我的船
<32-35,BENTLEY>Of course I did. It's my boat.

951
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,970
<32-36,BECKETT>你觉得如何  卡塞尔
<32-36,BECKETT>What about it, Castle?

952
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,610
<32-37,CASTLE>很漂亮
<32-37,CASTLE>Well, it's beautiful.

953
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,260
<32-37,CASTLE>我是说  非常完美
<32-37,CASTLE>I mean, it's perfect.

954
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,440
<32-37,CASTLE>教科书一般完美
<32-37,CASTLE>That knot could be in a book of nautical knots.

955
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,060
<32-38,BRADY>这与此案有什么关系
<32-38,BRADY>What does that have to do with anything?

956
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,090
<32-39,CASTLE>大家都认为凶手是
<32-39,CASTLE>Everyone agrees that the killer is the same person

957
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,760
<32-39,CASTLE>偷了阿伦·勒纳船的人
<32-39,CASTLE>Who stole Aaron Lerner's boat.

958
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,860
<32-39,CASTLE>那个人得把船系在码头
<32-39,CASTLE>That person had to tie the boat to the dock,

959
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,630
<32-39,CASTLE>但是那个结系得很马虎
<32-39,CASTLE>But that knot was sloppy.

960
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,100
<32-39,CASTLE>我甚至被它绊倒了
<32-39,CASTLE>I even tripped over it.

961
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,120
<32-39,CASTLE>无论是谁系了这个八字形
<32-39,CASTLE>Whoever tied these figure eights

962
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,670
<32-39,CASTLE>一定是个有经验的船夫
<32-39,CASTLE>is an experienced boatman.

963
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,390
<32-39,CASTLE>打结是他们与生俱来的手艺
<32-39,CASTLE>Tying knots would be their second nature.

964
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,710
<32-39,CASTLE>他们打不出这么马虎的结
<32-39,CASTLE>They'd be incapable of tying a sloppy knot.

965
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,970
<32-39,CASTLE>本特利不可能是凶手
<32-39,CASTLE>Bentley can't be the killer.

966
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,690
<32-40,BRADY>但是我们在本特利的公寓
<32-40,BRADY>But we found the burner phone

967
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,520
<32-40,BRADY>发现了打给富兰克林的
<32-40,BRADY>that placed the call to Franklin

968
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,040
<32-40,BRADY>一次性手机
<32-40,BRADY>in Bentley's apartment.

969
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,160
<32-40,BRADY>你怎么解释
<32-40,BRADY>How do you explain that?

970
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,740
<32-41,CASTLE>很简单  有人陷害
<32-41,CASTLE>Well, that's easy. It was planted.

971
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,590
<32-41,CASTLE>就像本特利的船上发现的毒品和枪支
<32-41,CASTLE>Just like Bentley's boat here had the meth and the gun,

972
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,520
<32-41,CASTLE>证据定会显示
<32-41,CASTLE>which I'm sure forensics will show

973
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,820
<32-41,CASTLE>这就是谋杀时用的凶器
<32-41,CASTLE>Is thehe actual murder weapon.

974
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:55,530
<32-42,BRADY>那你觉得会是谁要栽赃
<32-42,BRADY>And just who do you think planted it?

975
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,830
<32-43,CASTLE>你来告诉我
<32-43,CASTLE>Well, you tell me.

976
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,950
<32-44,BECKETT>布雷迪警长  谁从麦克莫瑞那里
<32-44,BECKETT>Uh, Chief Brady, who got the information from McMurray

977
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,210
<32-44,BECKETT>得知本特利的消息
<32-44,BECKETT>on Bentley?

978
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,550
<32-45,BRADY>是琼斯  琼斯副警长
<32-45,BRADY>Jones. It was Deputy Jones.

979
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,930
<32-46,DEPUTY JONES>好了  好了  退后
<32-46,DEPUTY JONES>Okay, okay, get back!

980
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,280
<32-46,DEPUTY JONES>大家退后
<32-46,DEPUTY JONES>Everybody stay back!

981
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,060
<32-47,BRADY>放轻松  琼斯
<32-47,BRADY>Take it easy, Jones.

982
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,360
<32-47,BRADY>我们不想让任何人受伤
<32-47,BRADY>We don't want anybody to get hurt.

983
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,840
<32-48,DEPUTY JONES>你这个富有的周末狂欢者  你觉得你很聪明
<32-48,DEPUTY JONES>You rich weekenders, you think you're so smart.

984
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,410
<32-48,DEPUTY JONES>与此同时  你污染了我们的海滩
<32-48,DEPUTY JONES>Meantime, you-- you pollute our beaches,

985
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,170
<32-48,DEPUTY JONES>你四处挥霍你的钱  好像你是上等人
<32-48,DEPUTY JONES>You throw your money around like you're better than us.

986
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,540
<32-49,CASTLE>我从不觉得我是上等人
<32-49,CASTLE>I don't think I'm better than you.

987
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,710
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>闭嘴
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>Oh, shut up.

988
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,960
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>我从不在乎这些
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>I didn't care about that.

989
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,720
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>但是后来富兰克林在城里挣的钱
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>But then Franklin's city money

990
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,500
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>对他来说根本不够
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>wasn't good enough for him.

991
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,110
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>他不得不染指我的副业
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>He had to move in on my side business.

992
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,460
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>所以我做了必须要做的事
<32-50,DEPUTY JONES>So I did what I had to do--

993
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,460
<32-51,BECKETT>抓到了
<32-51,BECKETT>Got it.

994
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,060
<32-51,BECKETT>干得好
<32-51,BECKETT>Nice!

995
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,750
<32-52,CASTLE>这可是《汉普顿希特》里我没想到的反转
<32-52,CASTLE>There's a "Hamptons Heat" twist I did not see coming.

996
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,330
<32-52,CASTLE>抱歉我们一直怀疑你有嫌疑
<32-52,CASTLE>Sorry about the whole "Accusing you of murder"--

997
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,160
<32-52,CASTLE>还是朋友吧
<32-52,CASTLE>Still buddies?

998
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,300
<32-52,CASTLE>是
<32-52,CASTLE>Yeah.

999
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,790
<33-1,BRADY>结果发现是琼斯
<33-1,BRADY>So it turns out that Jones

1000
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,240
<33-1,BRADY>付给麦克莫瑞五百块
<33-1,BRADY>paid McMurray 500 bucks

1001
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,070
<33-1,BRADY>去抹黑本特利
<33-1,BRADY>to point a finger at Bentley.

1002
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,710
<33-2,BECKETT>五百块去毁了一个人的一生
<33-2,BECKETT>Wow. $500 to ruin a man's life, huh?

1003
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,300
<33-3,BRADY>不是危言耸听
<33-3,BRADY>And not to sound all scooby,

1004
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,760
<33-3,BRADY>但如果不是你  他很有可能逃脱了  卡塞尔
<33-3,BRADY>but he might have gotten away with it if not for you, Castle.

1005
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,080
<33-4,CASTLE>能帮到我在执法部门的朋友
<33-4,CASTLE>Well, I'm always glad to help out

1006
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,800
<33-4,CASTLE>我一向乐意
<33-4,CASTLE>my friends in law enforcement.

1007
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,810
<33-4,CASTLE>说到这里
<33-4,CASTLE>Speaking of which,

1008
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,360
<33-5,BECKETT>我想来段祝酒辞
<33-5,BECKETT>I would like to make a toast.

1009
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,230
<33-6,CASTLE>布雷迪警长
<33-6,CASTLE>Chief Brady,

1010
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,650
<33-5,BECKETT>不是所有人都能像你一样应付得了
<33-5,BECKETT>Not everyone could've handled themselves

1011
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,470
<33-5,BECKETT>今天在码头上遇到的状况
<33-5,BECKETT>the way you did on the dock today.

1012
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,550
<33-5,BECKETT>你是个好警察
<33-5,BECKETT>You're a good cop.

<33-9,BRADY>你放心  我会保守秘密的
<33-9,BRADY>And you can rest assured, your secret is safe with me.

1016

1018
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,690
<33-12,BRADY>我枪击了嫌犯
<33-12,BRADY>I shot the bad guy.

1019
