7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,840
<1-2,NURSE TWO>-天啊  她的脸  -她怎么了
<1-2,NURSE TWO>- God. Her face. - What happened to her?

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,760
<1-3,NURSE ONE>有脉搏  她还活着
<1-3,NURSE ONE>I got a pulse. She's still alive.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,710
<1-3,NURSE ONE>快拿轮床来  快
<1-3,NURSE ONE>Get a gurney. Now!

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,260
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>哪去了
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Where'd it go?

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,860
<2-2,MARTHA RODGERS>什么哪去了  亲爱的
<2-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Where'd what go, darling?

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,500
<2-3,CASTLE>我在马戏团餐厅打包的菜  就放在这里
<2-3,CASTLE>My leftovers from le cirque. They were right here.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,740
<2-3,CASTLE>冰箱这个地方现在空了
<2-3,CASTLE>Right where this hole in the fridge is.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,130
<2-3,CASTLE>我本来打算用那份烤里脊牛排
<2-3,CASTLE>I was gonna use that chateaubriand

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,220
<2-3,CASTLE>给今早的炒蛋加料的
<2-3,CASTLE>for my morning scramble.

16
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,890
<2-4,MARTHA>肯定不是我吃的
<2-4,MARTHA>Well, I certainly didn't eat them.

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,700
<2-4,MARTHA>我要是把剩菜全塞肚子里
<2-4,MARTHA>I wouldn't look this good if I was...

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,930
<2-4,MARTHA>怎么可能保持这种身材
<2-4,MARTHA>pigging out on leftovers.

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,200
<2-5,CASTLE>这种事已经不是第一次发生了
<2-5,CASTLE>Yes, well, this isn't the first time this has happened.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,690
<2-5,CASTLE>过去这个月  吃的东西总是失踪
<2-5,CASTLE>Food has been going missing for the past month.

21
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,150
<2-5,CASTLE>不仅是剩菜
<2-5,CASTLE>It's not just leftovers, either.

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,530
<2-5,CASTLE>还有花生酱  洋蓟
<2-5,CASTLE>It was the peanut butter, uh, artichokes,

23
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,190
<2-5,CASTLE>一夸脱的咖哩肉汤  没了
<2-5,CASTLE>A whole quart of mulligatawny soup--gone.

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,180
<2-6,MARTHA>也许你又开始梦游吃东西了
<2-6,MARTHA>Well, maybe you've been sleep eating again.

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,820
<2-7,CASTLE>"又开始"  我从未"梦吃"  "梦游吃"
<2-7,CASTLE>Again? I've never sleep ated-- sleep ate--

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,470
<2-7,CASTLE>吃东西  我有吗
<2-7,CASTLE>Eaten-- have I?

27
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,920
<2-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>我去上课了
<2-8,ALEXIS CASTLE>Hey. I'm off to class.

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,070
<2-9,CASTLE>你觉得那份烤里脊牛排好吃吗
<2-9,CASTLE>How did you like that, uh, chateaubriand?

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,250
<2-9,CASTLE>其中的白葡萄酒酱汁是不是棒极了
<2-9,CASTLE>Wasn't that a wonderful white wine reduction?

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,600
<2-10,ALEXIS>什么烤里脊牛排
<2-10,ALEXIS>What chateaubriand?

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,380
<2-11,CASTLE>好吧  肯定是钟点工
<2-11,CASTLE>All right. It's the housekeeper.

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,270
<2-11,CASTLE>我就知道  她开始变胖了
<2-11,CASTLE>I knew it. She has been putting on weight.

33
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,460
<2-12,MARTHA>抱歉  儿子  她已经三天没来了
<2-12,MARTHA>Sorry, darling. She hasn't been here for three days.

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,840
<2-13,ALEXIS>也许地板下住着小小"借物人"
<2-13,ALEXIS>Maybe there are tiny borrowers living under the floorboards

36
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,530
<2-13,ALEXIS>晚上出来偷你的食物
<2-13,ALEXIS>who come out at night to steal your food.

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,790
<2-14,CASTLE>这不现实
<2-14,CASTLE>It's not realistic.

38
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,550
<2-14,CASTLE>他们太小了  根本打不开冰箱门
<2-14,CASTLE>They'd be too small to get the fridge door open.

39
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,560
<2-14,CASTLE>不过这里肯定有问题
<2-14,CASTLE>No, but something is going on here, though.

40
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,480
<2-14,CASTLE>我会找到答案
<2-14,CASTLE>And I'm gonna find out what.

41
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,000
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>不就是少了些吃的嘛  卡塞尔
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>So some food disappeared, Castle.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,980
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>有什么了不起的
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>What's the big deal?

43
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,930
<3-2,CASTLE>不会是你吧
<3-2,CASTLE>It wasn't you, was it?

44
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,370
<3-2,CASTLE>我知道你讨厌买日用品
<3-2,CASTLE>I know you hate to go grocery shopping.

45
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,300
<3-3,BECKETT>你不是吧  卡塞尔
<3-3,BECKETT>Seriously, castle?

46
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,390
<3-3,BECKETT>从周二起我就没去你家了
<3-3,BECKETT>I haven't been to your place since Tuesday.

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,790
<3-3,BECKETT>对
<3-3,BECKETT>Right.

48
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,340
<3-4,CASTLE>也许我的家被超级耗子入侵了
<3-4,CASTLE>Maybe my apartment's being invaded by some kind of super rat.

49
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,050
<3-4,CASTLE>无论是什么事  我已经采取了大胆的措施
<3-4,CASTLE>Whatever's going on, I've taken bold steps

50
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,740
<3-4,CASTLE>确保这种事不会再发生了
<3-4,CASTLE>to ensure it never happens again.

51
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,490
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>两位护士看到有人
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>These two nurses saw some guy

52
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,690
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>在凌晨四点把人扔下就开车走了
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>do a dump and drive around 4:00 A.M.

53
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,420
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>急救中心尽力挽救被害人
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>The trauma unit tried to save our vic,

54
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,480
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>但她没有挺过去
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>But she didn't make it.

55
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,410
<3-6,CASTLE>如果这个人是凶手  为什么送她来急诊中心
<3-6,CASTLE>If he's our killer, why would he take her to the E.R.?

56
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,080
<3-7,BECKETT>也许他良心上过不去
<3-7,BECKETT>Maybe he had a guilty conscience.

57
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,810
<3-7,BECKETT>护士有没有看清楚司机的样子
<3-7,BECKETT>Did the nurses get a good look at the driver?

58
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,150
<3-8,ESPOSITO>没有  但她们看到他的车
<3-8,ESPOSITO>No, but they did see his car.

59
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,940
<3-8,ESPOSITO>是辆蓝色轿车
<3-8,ESPOSITO>It was a blue sedan.

60
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
<3-8,ESPOSITO>医院保安正在找监控录像
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Hospital security's trying to get me some footage

61
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,380
<3-8,ESPOSITO>看能不能看清车牌
<3-8,ESPOSITO>to get the license plate.

62
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,120
<3-9,BECKETT>好的  在医院开始排查
<3-9,BECKETT>Okay, set up a canvass around the hospital.

63
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,320
<3-9,BECKETT>得找到看清楚司机长相的人
<3-9,BECKETT>We need to find someone that got a good look at the driver.

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,500
<3-9,BECKETT>被害人身份知道吗
<3-9,BECKETT>And where's our vic?

65
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,850
<3-10,ESPOSITO>尸体依然在急救中心
<3-10,ESPOSITO>Her body's still in the trauma bay.

66
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,000
<3-10,ESPOSITO>据说  样子很惨
<3-10,ESPOSITO>Word is, she was pretty messed up.

67
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,330
<4-1,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>警告下两位
<4-1,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>Uh, let me caution you.

68
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,110
<4-1,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>心脏脆弱者不易观看
<4-1,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>This is not for the faint of heart.

69
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,160
<4-2,CASTLE>这次我同意你的观点
<4-2,CASTLE>For once, I agree with you.

70
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,070
<4-3,BECKETT>伤口是什么造成的
<4-3,BECKETT>What did this to her?

71
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,970
<4-4,PERLMUTTER>任何都有可能  从撬棍到切割刀
<4-4,PERLMUTTER>Could be anything from a crowbar to a box cutter.

72
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,900
<4-4,PERLMUTTER>但看起来像是爪痕
<4-4,PERLMUTTER>But they look like claw marks.

73
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,570
<4-4,PERLMUTTER>但我无法分辨是什么类型的
<4-4,PERLMUTTER>I just can't tell what kind.

74
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,890
<4-5,CASTLE>如果是动物造成的  伤口应该是咬痕才对啊
<4-5,CASTLE>If it was an animal, wouldn't there be bite marks?

75
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,430
<4-6,PERLMUTTER>我要做详细尸检  确定死因
<4-6,PERLMUTTER>I might not find them until I do a complete exam

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,060
<4-6,PERLMUTTER>才有可能会找到咬痕
<4-6,PERLMUTTER>to determine the exact cause of death.

77
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,650
<4-7,BECKETT>现在的情况是没有犯罪现场
<4-7,BECKETT>Given the fact that we don't have a crime scene,

78
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,720
<4-7,BECKETT>有没有显示她遇害地点的线索
<4-7,BECKETT>is there any indication of where she was attacked?

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,730
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>没有  但我可以告诉你遇害时间
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>No, but, uh, I can tell you when.

80
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,430
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>根据发炎的程度  我可以说被害人
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>Based on the inflammation, I'd say the victim

81
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,390
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>在死前五六个小时就已经受伤了
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>sustained her injuries five to six hours before she died.

82
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,600
<4-9,BECKETT>我们会查明她的身份
<4-9,BECKETT>Well, we figure out who she is,

83
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,620
<4-9,BECKETT>也会查清楚她为什么惨遭毒手
<4-9,BECKETT>We'll find out how she wound up this way.

84
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,880
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>她叫安·卡蒂诺  27岁
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>Her name is Anne Cardinal, 27 years old.

<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>She was native american.

86
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,800
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>在纽约州中部的奥内达加保留区长大
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>Grew up on the onondaga reservation in central new york.

87
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,070
<5-2,BECKETT>有亲属吗
<5-2,BECKETT>Any next of kin?

88
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,660
<5-3,RYAN>没有  她没有兄弟姐妹
<5-3,RYAN>No. She had no siblings,

89
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,920
<5-3,RYAN>双亲已经去世
<5-3,RYAN>And both of her parents are gone.

90
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,100
<5-3,RYAN>她住在哈德森大学的校外宿舍
<5-3,RYAN>She lived in off-campus housing for Hudson University,

91
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,310
<5-3,RYAN>她在那里攻读进化生物学博士学位
<5-3,RYAN>Where she was working toward a PhD in Evolutionary Biology.

92
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,810
<5-4,BECKETT>好的  叫鉴证组去她的住处
<5-4,BECKETT>All right. Send C.S.U. to her apartment.

93
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,410
<5-4,BECKETT>问问她的朋友和邻居知不知道
<5-4,BECKETT>Talk to friends and neighbors to see if they know of

94
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,570
<5-4,BECKETT>她认识的人中有没有开蓝色轿车的
<5-4,BECKETT>anyone in her life who drove a blue sedan.

95
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,950
<5-5,CASTLE>还有谁想弄花她的脸
<5-5,CASTLE>And who wanted to mangle her face.

96
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,530
<5-6,ESPOSITO>对于脸部伤痕  我可能有解释
<5-6,ESPOSITO>I may have an explanation for those facial wounds.

97
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,310
<5-6,ESPOSITO>原来被害人在"安居所"养老院工作
<5-6,ESPOSITO>Turns out our victim worked at a retirement home called haven house.

98
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,260
<5-7,CASTLE>恶毒嗜血的老人家
<5-7,CASTLE>Vicious, blood-thirsty old folks,

99
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,300
<5-7,CASTLE>这是你的想法吗
<5-7,CASTLE>is that your theory?

100
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,490
<5-8,ESPOSITO>这不是人住的养老院  卡塞尔
<5-8,ESPOSITO>This home is not for people, Castle.

101
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,900
<5-8,ESPOSITO>是一家灵长类动物保护所
<5-8,ESPOSITO>It's a primate sanctuary.

102
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,160
<5-8,ESPOSITO>住的主要是从电影界退下来的
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Mostly for apes and chimpanzees and monkeys

103
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,600
<5-8,ESPOSITO>猿  黑猩猩  猴子
<5-8,ESPOSITO>who have retired from the movie business.

104
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,250
<5-9,RYAN>我小时候一直想要只宠物猴子
<5-9,RYAN>Ah, I always wanted a pet monkey when I was a kid.

105
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,510
<5-9,RYAN>我是《好奇乔治》的超级粉丝
<5-9,RYAN>Big "Curious George" Fan.

106
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,340
<5-10,CASTLE>等乔治长大你再看看
<5-10,CASTLE>Yeah. Wait till George grows up.

107
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,510
<5-10,CASTLE>成年黑猩猩可以长到200磅
<5-10,CASTLE>An adult chimpanzee can reach 200 pounds,

108
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,100
<5-10,CASTLE>可以撕碎成年男性的脸手及传宗接代部位
<5-10,CASTLE>Tear off a man's face, hands, and naughty bits.

109
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,010
<5-11,BECKETT>好了  我们去灵长类动物保护所
<5-11,BECKETT>All right, we're gonna go to the primate sanctuary.

110
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,030
<5-11,BECKETT>如果安是在那里遇袭的
<5-11,BECKETT>If Anne was attacked there,

111
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,370
<5-11,BECKETT>也许有人将她弃尸掩饰此事
<5-11,BECKETT>maybe someone dumped her body to cover it up.

112
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,470
<5-11,BECKETT>轿车方面有进展就打我电话
<5-11,BECKETT>And call me if you get anything on that sedan.

113
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,990
<5-12,RYAN>乔治才不会那样做
<5-12,RYAN>George would never do that.

114
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,230
<6-1,PAUL DEVLIN>真是可怕的损失
<6-1,PAUL DEVLIN>This is a terrible loss.

115
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,040
<6-1,PAUL DEVLIN>安是非常优秀的学生
<6-1,PAUL DEVLIN>Uh, I mean, Anne was a-a brilliant student

116
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
<6-1,PAUL DEVLIN>人也非常好
<6-1,PAUL DEVLIN>and a lovely person.

117
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,380
<6-2,BECKETT>鉴于她受的伤  我需要问清楚
<6-2,BECKETT>Given her wounds, I need to ask,

118
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,350
<6-2,BECKETT>在这里安与灵长类动物的接触达到什么程度
<6-2,BECKETT>how much interaction did Anne have with the primates here?

119
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,860
<6-3,PAUL>很少有直接的接触
<6-3,PAUL>Well, very little in terms of direct contact.

120
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,180
<6-3,PAUL>但我们有严格的培训指导
<6-3,PAUL>Uh, but we have very strict training guidelines

121
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,810
<6-3,PAUL>对所有员工都是
<6-3,PAUL>for all of our employees.

122
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,960
<6-4,BECKETT>我还是会叫鉴证组过来
<6-4,BECKETT>Still, I'll need the crime scene unit

123
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,400
<6-4,BECKETT>彻底调查这里
<6-4,BECKETT>to do a thorough investigation of this facility.

124
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,030
<6-5,PAUL>没问题  我会尽全力帮忙
<6-5,PAUL>Of course. Anything I can do to help.

125
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,200
<6-6,PAUL>我无法想象她被动物伤害了
<6-6,PAUL>I can't imagine she was harmed by any of our animals.

126
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,250
<6-6,PAUL>它们从来没有对她或任何人
<6-6,PAUL>They've never shown any aggressive behavior

127
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,090
<6-6,PAUL>有过攻击行为
<6-6,PAUL>towards her or anyone else.

128
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,180
<6-7,BECKETT>戴文博士  你对安·卡蒂诺有多了解
<6-7,BECKETT>Now, Dr. Devlin, how well did you know Anne Cardinal?

129
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,620
<6-8,PAUL>在哈德逊大学  我是她的辅导员
<6-8,PAUL>I was her faculty advisor at Hudson University.

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,230
<6-8,PAUL>几个月前
<6-8,PAUL>And when I found out

131
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,870
<6-8,PAUL>我发现她没工作
<6-8,PAUL>she was taking time off a couple of months ago,

132
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,460
<6-8,PAUL>就让她到这里工作
<6-8,PAUL>I offered her a job here.

133
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,330
<6-9,BECKETT>那她的工作是什么呢
<6-9,BECKETT>And what sort of work did she do?

134
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,000
<6-10,PAUL>我申请了一个基金
<6-10,PAUL>Oh, I have a grant

135
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,680
<6-10,PAUL>研究灵长类的社会性行为
<6-10,PAUL>to study the social behaviors of primates.

136
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,220
<6-10,PAUL>我雇了些哈德逊的学生
<6-10,PAUL>And I hire Hudson students...

137
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,490
<6-10,PAUL>比如她  还有身边的这位弗兰科
<6-10,PAUL>Like her and Franco here

138
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,770
<6-10,PAUL>协助照顾动物
<6-10,PAUL>to help manage the animals' care.

139
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,570
<6-11,CASTLE>他们都没有杀人的倾向吗
<6-11,CASTLE>Uh, and none of them have homicidal impulses,

140
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,810
<6-11,CASTLE>尤其是这位月光
<6-11,CASTLE>not even Moonshine here?

141
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,310
<6-12,PAUL>尤其不会是月光
<6-12,PAUL>Especially not moonshine.

142
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,390
<6-12,PAUL>他从出生起就生活在人类身边
<6-12,PAUL>He's been around people his whole life,

143
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,790
<6-12,PAUL>而且他很合群
<6-12,PAUL>And he's very social.

144
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,070
<6-13,BECKETT>你们俩最后一次见到安是什么时候
<6-13,BECKETT>Uh, when was the last time either of you saw Anne?

145
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,920
<6-14,FRANCO>昨天我们一起工作  她似乎一切都很好
<6-14,FRANCO>We worked together yesterday. She seemed totally fine.

146
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
<6-14,FRANCO>但她提前下班了  这不是她的作风
<6-14,FRANCO>She did leave early. That wasn't like her.

147
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,820
<6-14,FRANCO>她说有要紧事要做
<6-14,FRANCO>Said she had something important to do.

148
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,350
<6-15,BECKETT>她有说是什么事吗
<6-15,BECKETT>Did she say what it was?

149
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,000
<6-16,PAUL>可能和那场争执有关吧
<6-16,PAUL>It might have had something to do with that argument she had.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
<6-17,BECKETT>什么争执
<6-17,BECKETT>What argument?

151
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,690
<6-18,PAUL>午休时  我看见她在停车场
<6-18,PAUL>Uh, I saw her in the parking garage around lunchtime,

152
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,600
<6-18,PAUL>和一个男人说话
<6-18,PAUL>talking to a man.

153
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,870
<6-18,PAUL>我从没见过他
<6-18,PAUL>I'd never seen him before,

154
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,230
<6-18,PAUL>但他似乎非常生气
<6-18,PAUL>But he seemed very angry with her.

155
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,490
<6-19,BECKETT>你觉得你能给素描专家描述他的样子吗
<6-19,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist?

156
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,980
<6-20,PAUL>可以  一定没问题
<6-20,PAUL>Yeah, I most definitely could.

157
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,670
<7-1,CASTLE>我知道凶手是谁
<7-1,CASTLE>Well, I know who the killer is.

158
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,340
<7-1,CASTLE>你看到那只猩猩看我的眼神了吗
<7-1,CASTLE>Did you see how that gorilla looked at me?

159
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,220
<7-2,BECKETT>看到了  我猜是情欲  卡塞尔
<7-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I think it was lust, actually, Castle.

160
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,930
<7-2,BECKETT>你...有种粗犷的帅气
<7-2,BECKETT>You are... ruggedly handsome.

161
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,270
<7-2,BECKETT>嗜血欲才对
<7-2,BECKETT>Bloodlust, maybe.

162
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,670
<7-3,CASTLE>不  别让月光给骗了
<7-3,CASTLE>No, don't let Moonshine fool you.

163
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,000
<7-3,CASTLE>我肯定他和他那些退役同伙
<7-3,CASTLE>I'm betting he and his fellow "Retirees"

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,270
<7-3,CASTLE>其实是高智慧人猿
<7-3,CASTLE>Are actually super-intelligent apes,

165
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,920
<7-3,CASTLE>谋划着占领纽约
<7-3,CASTLE>Plotting to take over New York city.

166
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,220
<7-3,CASTLE>他们会困住所有人
<7-3,CASTLE>They're gonna round up all the people,

167
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,520
<7-3,CASTLE>把我们关进疯人院
<7-3,CASTLE>Put us in a sanctuary.

168
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,980
<7-3,CASTLE>很可能  安发现了他们
<7-3,CASTLE>Most likely, Anne got on to them...

169
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,930
<7-3,CASTLE>他们就除掉了她
<7-3,CASTLE>They took her out.

170
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,180
<7-4,BECKETT>如果这些猴子真的密谋
<7-4,BECKETT>Now if this monkey cabal

171
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,600
<7-4,BECKETT>想除掉安以绝后患
<7-4,BECKETT>really wanted to get Anne out of the picture,

172
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,570
<7-4,BECKETT>那为什么要把她丢到医院去
<7-4,BECKETT>Why did they drop her off at the hospital?

173
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,700
<7-5,CASTLE>显然...是因为内心的斗争
<7-5,CASTLE>Well, obviously... they were conflicted.

174
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,330
<7-5,CASTLE>人和猿之间的情感关系  是非常复杂的
<7-5,CASTLE>It's very complicated, the relationship between man and primate.

175
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,670
<7-5,CASTLE>你没看《猿球崛起》吗
<7-5,CASTLE>Didn't you see "Rise of the planet of the apes"?

176
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,430
<7-5,CASTLE>警示预言啊
<7-5,CASTLE>Cautionary tale.

177
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,550
<7-6,BECKETT>不好意思打破了你的幻想  卡塞尔
<7-6,BECKETT>Sorry to burst your bubble, Castle,

178
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,920
<7-6,BECKETT>不过犯罪现场可没在安居所
<7-6,BECKETT>But C.S.U. hasn't found a crime scene at haven house.

179
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,250
<7-6,BECKETT>安不是在那里被袭击的
<7-6,BECKETT>Anne wasn't attacked there.

180
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,750
<7-7,CASTLE>那袭击是在哪里发生的  又是什么袭击她的呢
<7-7,CASTLE>Well, then where was the attack, and by what?

181
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,990
<7-8,ESPOSITO>打断一下
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Hey, so, uh,

182
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,580
<7-8,ESPOSITO>有目击者在医院一个街区外的地方
<7-8,ESPOSITO>a witness saw a blue sedan take out a side mirror

183
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,070
<7-8,ESPOSITO>看到一辆蓝色轿车撞掉一个后视镜
<7-8,ESPOSITO>about a block away from our hospital

184
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,060
<7-8,ESPOSITO>时间也符合
<7-8,ESPOSITO>in our time window.

185
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,070
<7-8,ESPOSITO>他们查到了牌照
<7-8,ESPOSITO>They got a plate.

186
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,700
<7-8,ESPOSITO>车主是艾迪·麦斯隆
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Owner of the car was Eddie Maslon.

187
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,620
<7-9,BECKETT>-他和安有什么关系  -不太清楚
<7-9,BECKETT>- How is he connected to Anne? - Well, I'm not really sure,

188
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,390
<7-10,ESPOSITO>但是说到伤人  艾迪再熟练不过了
<7-10,ESPOSITO>but Eddie knows how to put the hurt on people.

189
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,980
<7-10,ESPOSITO>他才因为两起谋杀在新新监狱坐了八年牢
<7-10,ESPOSITO>He just did eight years in Sing Sing for murder two.

190
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,470
<7-10,ESPOSITO>而且他也有办法弄伤安的脸
<7-10,ESPOSITO>And he had a way to mess up Anne's face.

191
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,500
<7-10,ESPOSITO>市里有记录  他养了只叫坏坏的斗牛犬
<7-10,ESPOSITO>City records shows he had a pit bull named Badass.

192
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,560
<7-11,BECKETT>一个判过刑的凶手再加一只具有攻击性的狗吗
<7-11,BECKETT>A convicted killer with an attack dog?

193
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,080
<7-11,BECKETT>很好  把他抓过来
<7-11,BECKETT>All right. Pick him up.

194
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,970
<7-12,ESPOSITO>没问题
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Right on.

195
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,490
<7-12,ESPOSITO>该死
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Damn it.

196
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,530
<7-13,CASTLE>我真以为是月光
<7-13,CASTLE>I really liked Moonshine for this.

197
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,670
<8-1,EDDIE MASLON>我从没见过她
<8-1,EDDIE MASLON>I've never seen her before.

198
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,880
<8-2,BECKETT>昨晚你把她丢到急诊室门口
<8-2,BECKETT>You dumped her outside of the E.R. last night,

199
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,950
<8-2,BECKETT>只是她那时是...
<8-2,BECKETT>except she looked more like...

200
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,030
<8-2,BECKETT>这个样子
<8-2,BECKETT>this.

201
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,880
<8-2,BECKETT>是你的狗干的吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Your dog do that to her?

202
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
<8-2,BECKETT>艾迪  你才出狱三个月
<8-2,BECKETT>Eddie, you've been out of prison for three months.

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,130
<8-2,BECKETT>如果不想回去的话  最好赶快坦白
<8-2,BECKETT>You better start talking unless you want to go back.

204
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,630
<8-3,EDDIE>行  我没碰她
<8-3,EDDIE>Okay, look, I didn't touch her.

205
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,430
<8-3,EDDIE>坏坏也是
<8-3,EDDIE>And neither did Badass.

206
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,010
<8-3,EDDIE>不论是什么东西伤的她
<8-3,EDDIE>Whatever did that to her,

207
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,330
<8-3,EDDIE>都不会是狗
<8-3,EDDIE>that wasn't no dog.

208
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,270
<8-4,BECKETT>那她怎么到你的车里去了呢
<8-4,BECKETT>Then how'd she end up in your car?

209
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,920
<8-5,EDDIE>我昨晚从酒吧出来
<8-5,EDDIE>I was leaving a bar last night,

210
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,580
<8-5,EDDIE>碰巧拐错了弯  进了一条巷子
<8-5,EDDIE>and I happened to make a wrong turn down an alleyway.

211
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,370
<8-5,EDDIE>看到她躺在那里  血肉模糊
<8-5,EDDIE>And I saw her laying there. She was all messed up.

212
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,710
<8-5,EDDIE>我不能把她丢在那里  让她等死
<8-5,EDDIE>I couldn't just leave her there to die.

213
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,920
<8-6,BECKETT>那你还变成活雷锋了啊
<8-6,BECKETT>Oh, so you're a good samaritan now?

214
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
<8-7,EDDIE>如果我想杀她
<8-7,EDDIE>If I wanted to kill her,

215
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,400
<8-7,EDDIE>那我何必载她去医院呢
<8-7,EDDIE>why would I bring her to a hospital?

216
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,980
<8-8,BECKETT>如果你想救她
<8-8,BECKETT>If you wanted to save her,

217
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,190
<8-8,BECKETT>那为什么把她扔到医院门口呢
<8-8,BECKETT>why would you ditch her outside of one?

218
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,700
<8-9,EDDIE>因为以我的记录  我知道我会被冤枉
<8-9,EDDIE>Because with my record, I knew I'd get blamed,

219
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,490
<8-9,EDDIE>现在不就是这样吗
<8-9,EDDIE>which is exactly what's happening now.

220
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,840
<8-10,BECKETT>是啊
<8-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

221
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,730
<8-11,EDDIE>好人没好报
<8-11,EDDIE>No good deed, huh?

222
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,530
<8-12,BECKETT>行
<8-12,BECKETT>Okay, fine.

223
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,380
<8-12,BECKETT>那你说说你在哪里找到她的
<8-12,BECKETT>Then why don't you tell me where you supposedly found her?

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,470
<9-1,BECKETT>这是血迹
<9-1,BECKETT>Well, it's blood.

225
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,480
<9-1,BECKETT>也许艾迪没说谎
<9-1,BECKETT>Maybe Eddie was telling the truth.

227
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,820
<9-2,CASTLE>你得看看这个
<9-2,CASTLE>You need to see this.

228
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
<9-3,BECKETT>我的天
<9-3,BECKETT>What the...

229
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,340
<9-3,BECKETT>脚印
<9-3,BECKETT>Footprints.

230
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,260
<9-4,CASTLE>巨大的脚印
<9-4,CASTLE>Giant footprints...

231
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,910
<9-4,CASTLE>可能是什么野兽  那些恐怖的抓痕
<9-4,CASTLE>Made by some kind of beast. Those vicious claw marks,

232
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
<9-4,CASTLE>残忍的伤口
<9-4,CASTLE>savage wounds,

233
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,710
<9-4,CASTLE>她的血迹
<9-4,CASTLE>her blood,

234
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,190
<9-4,CASTLE>还有这些脚印
<9-4,CASTLE>these footprints...

235
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,360
<9-4,CASTLE>这都指向一件事
<9-4,CASTLE>It all adds up to one thing.

236
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,530
<9-4,CASTLE>真凶是大脚怪
<9-4,CASTLE>She was killed by bigfoot.

246
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,130
<9-4,CASTLE>真的  贝克特
<9-4,CASTLE>Seriously, Beckett,

247
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,040
<10-1,CASTLE>你知道这意味着什么吗
<10-1,CASTLE>Do you have any idea what this means?

248
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,320
<10-1,CASTLE>我们即将成为全国
<10-1,CASTLE>We are about to be the first people in the nation--

249
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,840
<10-1,CASTLE>不  全世界  第一个侦破大脚怪谋杀案的人
<10-1,CASTLE>no, the world-- to solve a bigfoot murder.

250
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,630
<10-2,BECKETT>真有趣  卡塞尔  不过大脚怪是不存在的
<10-2,BECKETT>Very funny, Castle, but there is no such thing as bigfoot.

251
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,500
<10-3,CASTLE>这句话你跟那些
<10-3,CASTLE>Tell that to the people

252
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,270
<10-3,CASTLE>这四百年来亲眼见过它们的人说去
<10-3,CASTLE>who've been sighting him for 400 years.

253
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,200
<10-4,PERLMUTTER>我测了血型
<10-4,PERLMUTTER>So I typed the blood.

254
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,420
<10-4,PERLMUTTER>和死者的一样
<10-4,PERLMUTTER>It's a match to our victim.

255
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,330
<10-5,CASTLE>别管血迹了
<10-5,CASTLE>Never mind the blood.

256
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,620
<10-5,CASTLE>你对这个怎么看
<10-5,CASTLE>What is your opinion on these?

257
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,530
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>以我的专业知识  我看不出
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>Well, professionally, I can't speculate

258
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,780
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>这是什么  卡塞尔先生
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>what those are, Mr. Castle.

259
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,060
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>但个人而言  我认为
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>But personally, I can say

260
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,130
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>任何相信大脚怪传说的都是混蛋
<10-6,PERLMUTTER>that anyone who believes in bigfoot is an ass.

261
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,150
<10-7,CASTLE>那是无知的人常常会下的断言
<10-7,CASTLE>That is a common assertion amongst the uninformed.

262
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,680
<10-8,BECKETT>好吧  老兄  就算有大脚怪
<10-8,BECKETT>Okay, buddy, let's say there is a bigfoot.

263
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,140
<10-8,BECKETT>一个巨大长毛  酷似猩猩的怪物
<10-8,BECKETT>How does a giant hairy ape-man

264
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,600
<10-8,BECKETT>在城市里怎么会没人看到
<10-8,BECKETT>get around the city unseen?

265
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,540
<10-9,CASTLE>很简单  沿着大脚印往那边看
<10-9,CASTLE>Easy. Follow the big fat footprints.

266
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,570
<10-10,BECKETT>什么
<10-10,BECKETT>What?

267
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,420
<10-11,CASTLE>地铁隧道
<10-11,CASTLE>Subway access tunnel.

268
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,020
<10-11,CASTLE>从飓风桑迪之后  这些隧道很多都被关闭了
<10-11,CASTLE>Since hurricane Sandy, a lot of those are still closed.

269
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,030
<10-11,CASTLE>就成了大脚怪的通行场所
<10-11,CASTLE>So bigfoot's been using them to get around.

270
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,570
<10-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那太荒谬了
<10-12,BECKETT>Castle, that's ridiculous.

271
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,840
<10-13,CASTLE>你怎么能说
<10-13,CASTLE>How can you say...

272
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,270
<10-13,CASTLE>瞧瞧这些大脚印
<10-13,CASTLE>Look at these footprints.

273
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,050
<10-14,BECKETT>我感兴趣的是这些正常人的脚印
<10-14,BECKETT>These are the footprints that I'm interested in.

274
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,480
<10-14,BECKETT>它们位于尸体附近
<10-14,BECKETT>They're near where the body was.

275
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,190
<10-14,BECKETT>鉴证组说这些是在过去的24小时内留下的
<10-14,BECKETT>C.S.U. Said that they were made within the last 24 hours.

276
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,300
<10-15,CASTLE>那可能是艾迪·麦斯隆的
<10-15,CASTLE>Could be Eddie Maslon's?

277
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,170
<10-16,BECKETT>这是13码的鞋
<10-16,BECKETT>At size 13?

278
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,560
<10-16,BECKETT>那家伙那么矮  不可能有这么大的脚
<10-16,BECKETT>The guy's too short to have feet this big. No.

279
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,770
<10-16,BECKETT>这些脚印才是我们目前最好的线索
<10-16,BECKETT>These boot prints are our best lead.

280
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,820
<10-16,BECKETT>是这些脚印
<10-16,BECKETT>These prints,

281
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,030
<10-16,BECKETT>而不是那些巨大的脚印
<10-16,BECKETT>not the tracks from the giant clown feet.

282
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,030
<10-17,CASTLE>是啊  我们到了犯罪现场  却要忽视证据
<10-17,CASTLE>Yes, let's go to a crime scene and ignore the evidence.

283
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,190
<11-1,CASTLE>你是说有人嫁祸给大脚怪吗
<11-1,CASTLE>You're saying someone framed bigfoot?

284
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,170
<11-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我是说  有人
<11-2,BECKETT>All I'm saying, Castle, is that someone--

285
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,160
<11-2,BECKETT>一个人类
<11-2,BECKETT>A human being--

286
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,080
<11-2,BECKETT>在那条巷子里留下了大脚怪的脚印
<11-2,BECKETT>left the bigfoot prints in that alleyway.

287
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,760
<11-3,CASTLE>是啊  然后伪造现场
<11-3,CASTLE>Yeah, and staged the crime scene

288
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,830
<11-3,CASTLE>使之看起来像大脚怪是凶手
<11-3,CASTLE>to make it look as though bigfoot was the killer?

289
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,780
<11-3,CASTLE>为什么要大费周章把罪责引向大脚怪
<11-3,CASTLE>Why go through the trouble of blaming bigfoot,

290
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,310
<11-3,CASTLE>那种生物甚至很少有人相信其真的存在
<11-3,CASTLE>a creature a select few of us even believe exists,

291
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,250
<11-3,CASTLE>更别说成为谋杀案的嫌疑人了
<11-3,CASTLE>never mind could be a murder suspect?

292
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,630
<11-4,ESPOSITO>说到嫌疑人
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Speaking of suspects,

293
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,270
<11-4,ESPOSITO>安的老板帮着把那家伙的素描像画出来了
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Anne's boss came through with a sketch of the guy

294
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,950
<11-4,ESPOSITO>也就是她死那天和她发生争吵的人
<11-4,ESPOSITO>she argued with the day she died.

295
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,590
<11-5,BECKETT>好好看看  卡塞尔
<11-5,BECKETT>Take a look, Castle.

296
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,490
<11-5,BECKETT>一个嫌疑人  请注意重点在这个"人"上
<11-5,BECKETT>A person of interest, emphasis on the word "Person."

297
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,160
<11-5,BECKETT>去找安的家人和朋友谈谈
<11-5,BECKETT>Talk to Anne's friends and family

298
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,840
<11-5,BECKETT>看看有没有人能认出他
<11-5,BECKETT>and see if anyone recognizes him.

299
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,330
<11-6,RYAN>我觉得现在还不能排除大脚怪作案的嫌疑
<11-6,RYAN>I wouldn't rule out bigfoot just yet.

300
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,910
<11-6,RYAN>调查发现  在过去的几个月中
<11-6,RYAN>Turns out there have been dozens of reported bigfoot sightings

301
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,660
<11-6,RYAN>城里出现了几十起声称发现大脚怪的报告
<11-6,RYAN>in the city in the past couple of months.

302
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,920
<11-7,CASTLE>是吗
<11-7,CASTLE>Is that right?

303
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,440
<11-7,CASTLE>莱恩警探  快告诉我们
<11-7,CASTLE>Why, Detective Ryan, please tell us

304
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,550
<11-7,CASTLE>这一最新而又令人兴奋的进展
<11-7,CASTLE>about this new and extraordinary development.

305
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,990
<11-8,RYAN>比如这位住在布鲁克林的女士
<11-8,RYAN>Like this woman in brooklyn.

306
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,040
<11-8,RYAN>她声称大脚怪试图爬进
<11-8,RYAN>She says that bigfoot tried to break into her apartment

307
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,230
<11-8,RYAN>-她位于二楼的家里  -先生们
<11-8,RYAN>- On the second floor. - Gentlemen.

308
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,830
<11-9,ESPOSITO>我这人不喜欢打击你们的信心
<11-9,ESPOSITO>I hate to rain on your parade.

309
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,400
<11-10,CASTLE>-是吗  -不是
<11-10,CASTLE>-Do you? - No.

310
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,580
<11-10,CASTLE>但关于大脚怪的报道
<11-10,CASTLE>But here's the reason

311
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,270
<11-11,ESPOSITO>突然暴增的原因是这个
<11-11,ESPOSITO>that bigfoot reports have spiked.

312
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,240
<11-11,ESPOSITO>两个月前
<11-11,ESPOSITO>Two months ago,

313
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,060
<11-11,ESPOSITO>一档叫《怪物任务》的电视节目
<11-11,ESPOSITO>The TV show "Mission: monster,"

314
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,810
<11-11,ESPOSITO>悬赏100万美元
<11-11,ESPOSITO>put out a $1 million reward

315
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,320
<11-11,ESPOSITO>给捕获或能证明大脚怪存在的证据
<11-11,ESPOSITO>for the capture and/or proof that bigfoot exists.

316
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,730
<11-12,BECKETT>瞧见没  卡塞尔  所有这些
<11-12,BECKETT>See, Castle? All of this evidence

317
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,000
<11-12,BECKETT>你声称大脚怪存在的证据
<11-12,BECKETT>that you claim proves bigfoot's existence

318
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,760
<11-12,BECKETT>不过是人们为了钱蓄意制造的
<11-12,BECKETT>is actually people angling for money.

319
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,940
<11-14,BECKETT>所以你是说这一切只是个巧合吗
<11-14,BECKETT>So you're saying it's just a coincidence

320
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,480
<11-13,CASTLE>安的工作是和灵长类动物打交道
<11-13,CASTLE>that Anne was working with primates

321
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,980
<11-13,CASTLE>其神秘被害的地点附近又发现了大脚怪的脚印
<11-13,CASTLE>and mysteriously killed where bigfoot prints were found?

322
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,670
<11-14,BECKETT>不  不是巧合  只是恶作剧罢了
<11-14,BECKETT>No, not a coincidence. Just a hoax.

323
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,890
<11-15,RYAN>如果真是恶作剧
<11-15,RYAN>If it's such a hoax,

324
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,790
<11-15,RYAN>那你告诉我为什么我发现了这个
<11-15,RYAN>then tell me why I found this.

325
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,390
<11-15,RYAN>我调出了她的通话记录
<11-15,RYAN>I dug into her phone records.

326
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,900
<11-15,RYAN>结果发现  她死前的最后一通电话是
<11-15,RYAN>Turns out, the last phone call she ever made

327
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,410
<11-16,CASTLE>打给达雷尔·米克斯的
<11-16,CASTLE>was to Darrell Meeks.

328
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,590
<11-16,CASTLE>那位达雷尔·米克斯吗
<11-16,CASTLE>The Darrell Meeks?

329
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,720
<11-16,CASTLE>谁是达雷尔·米克斯
<11-16,CASTLE>Who's Darrell Meeks?

330
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,920
<11-16,CASTLE>竟然问谁是达雷尔·米克斯
<11-16,CASTLE>Who's Darrell Meeks?

331
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,050
<11-17,RYAN>他是一个世界闻名的神秘动物学家
<11-17,RYAN>Just a world-renowned cryptozoologist.

332
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,030
<11-18,CASTLE>那可是个科学家的一种
<11-18,CASTLE>That's a scientist

333
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,320
<11-18,CASTLE>专门致力于搜寻尚未被发现的生物
<11-18,CASTLE>who searches for as-yet undiscovered creatures.

334
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,740
<11-19,BECKETT>就比如独角兽和半人马吗
<11-19,BECKETT>Such as unicorns and centaurs?

335
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,430
<11-20,ESPOSITO>女妖和小妖吗
<11-20,ESPOSITO>Banshees and leprechauns?

336
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,740
<11-21,RYAN>米克斯博士恰巧是
<11-21,RYAN>Doctor Meeks also happens to be

337
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,960
<11-21,RYAN>研究大脚怪最权威的专家
<11-21,RYAN>the foremost authority on bigfoot.

338
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,500
<11-22,CASTLE>你瞧  她死的那天还给他打电话了
<11-22,CASTLE>And lo and behold, she called him on the very day she died.

339
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,540
<11-22,CASTLE>你还是认为大脚怪与此案无关吗
<11-22,CASTLE>Still think bigfoot has nothing to do with this?

340
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,820
<11-23,BECKETT>帕穆特那边有所发现
<11-23,BECKETT>Perlmutter's got something for us.

341
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,840
<11-23,BECKETT>你们两个过去看看
<11-23,BECKETT>Why don't you guys head over there?

342
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,580
<11-20,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔和我去找
<11-20,ESPOSITO>Castle and I will talk to

343
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,330
<11-21,RYAN>全世界关于大脚怪最权威的专家谈谈
<11-21,RYAN>the world's foremost authority on bigfoot.

344
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,940
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>竟然是副手
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>The "B" Team.

345
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,660
<12-2,ESPOSITO>-你不也是替班的吗  -就是啊
<12-2,ESPOSITO>- Talk about the "B" Team. - Yeah.

346
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,980
<12-3,RYAN>我只是想看到卡塞尔沮丧的表情
<12-3,RYAN>Look, I had hoped to see castle's look of dismay

347
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,300
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>因为我会告诉他死因
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>when I told him cause of death

348
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,300
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>不过是颅骨受到钝力重击
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>was nothing more exotic than blunt-force trauma to the cranium.

349
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,180
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>似乎她的头部被球棒
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>It--it seems that she was clobbered over the head

350
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,790
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>或管子猛敲过
<12-4,PERLMUTTER>with a club or a pipe.

351
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,250
<12-5,ESPOSITO>你可以在电话里告诉我们的
<12-5,ESPOSITO>You coulda said so over the phone.

352
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,700
<12-6,PERLMUTTER>但我还有另外两个很重要的发现
<12-6,PERLMUTTER>Ah, but I also made two highly intriguing discoveries.

353
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
<12-7,RYAN>关于她脸上的那些伤口吗
<12-7,RYAN>About the wounds on her face?

354
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,920
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>那些伤口的成因尚无法确定
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>Uh, well, their cause is still undetermined,

355
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,530
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>但更有趣的地方在于
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>But of far greater interest is the fact--

356
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,740
<12-9,RYAN>因为那些很可能是爪子撕裂的
<12-9,RYAN>'cause they could be claw marks.

357
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,940
<12-9,RYAN>大脚怪是有脚爪的
<12-9,RYAN>Bigfoot has claws.

358
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,110
<12-10,ESPOSITO>金刚狼也有  那是真实存在的吗
<12-10,ESPOSITO>So does wolverine. Is he real?

359
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,700
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>你们俩闹完没
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>Are you done?

360
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,360
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>我在她的头部伤口里发现了这块碎玻璃
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>I found this glass embedded in her head wound.

361
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,560
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>那上面有一层增透膜
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>It has an antireflective coating,

362
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,260
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>就像镜片上常用的那种
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>like on prescription lenses.

363
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,410
<12-12,ESPOSITO>但她并不戴眼镜  那是从哪儿来的
<12-12,ESPOSITO>But she didn't wear glasses. So where'd it come from?

364
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,730
<12-13,PERLMUTTER>我只能告诉你们那东西是被
<12-13,PERLMUTTER>All I can tell you is that it was practically

365
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,760
<12-13,PERLMUTTER>击中她的东西硬敲进她的颅骨中去的
<12-13,PERLMUTTER>hammered into her skull by whatever hit her.

366
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,330
<12-15,RYAN>我们这就送去实验室化验
<12-15,RYAN>We'll send it in for analysis.

367
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,770
<12-15,RYAN>好吧  你们该把这个也拿过去
<12-15,RYAN>Yeah, well, you should take this while you're at it.

368
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,750
<12-16,PERLMUTTER>这是在她胃里发现的
<12-16,PERLMUTTER>Found that in her stomach.

369
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,690
<12-17,ESPOSITO>一个吊坠  在她的胃里
<12-17,ESPOSITO>A pendant... in her stomach?

370
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,010
<12-18,PERLMUTTER>她在死前5到6小时吞下去的
<12-18,PERLMUTTER>It appears she swallowed it five to six hours before she died.

371
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,510
<12-19,ESPOSITO>就是她遭受袭击的时候
<12-19,ESPOSITO>The same time she was attacked.

372
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,430
<12-19,ESPOSITO>她为什么要吞下呢
<12-19,ESPOSITO>Why would she swallow it?

373
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,710
<12-20,RYAN>或许她知道自己就要死了
<12-20,RYAN>Maybe she knew she was gonna die

374
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,140
<12-20,RYAN>她想传达某种信息
<12-20,RYAN>And she was trying to send a message.

375
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,540
<12-21,ESPOSITO>或者她不希望这个吊坠被凶手拿去
<12-21,ESPOSITO>Or she was trying to keep this pendant from her killer.

376
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,010
<13-1,CASTLE>这张照片是你拍的吗
<13-1,CASTLE>Did you take this photo?

377
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,420
<13-2,DARRELL MEEKS>是的  当时我正在加拿大西部探险
<13-2,DARRELL MEEKS>Yes. Uh, it's an expedition I led in western Canada.

378
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,650
<13-2,DARRELL MEEKS>那是我23年来最接近它们的一次
<13-2,DARRELL MEEKS>It's the closest I've ever gotten to him in 23 years.

379
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,750
<13-3,BECKETT>米克斯博士
<13-3,BECKETT>Dr. Meeks,

380
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,830
<13-3,BECKETT>安死前最后一通电话就是打给你的
<13-3,BECKETT>You were the last person that Anne spoke with just before she died.

381
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,100
<13-3,BECKETT>她打给你是为什么事
<13-3,BECKETT>Why did she call you?

382
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,460
<13-4,DARRELL>是的  我觉得她打来是想问
<13-4,DARRELL>Yes, I-I think she called me to ask me

383
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,720
<13-4,DARRELL>我是否认为大脚怪会冒险进入市区
<13-4,DARRELL>if I thought that bigfoot would venture into an urban area.

384
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,550
<13-5,CASTLE>你是怎么回答她的
<13-5,CASTLE>And what did you tell her?

385
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,070
<13-6,DARRELL>根据城市发展
<13-6,DARRELL>Well, given development

386
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,500
<13-6,DARRELL>对野生环境的侵占来说
<13-6,DARRELL>and urban encroachment in the wilderness,

387
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,730
<13-6,DARRELL>这是迟早的事
<13-6,DARRELL>sooner or later, it was inevitable.

388
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,170
<13-6,DARRELL>我怀疑她手里有
<13-6,DARRELL>And I suspect that she had evidence

389
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,770
<13-6,DARRELL>大脚怪在城市中出现过的证据
<13-6,DARRELL>of the presence of bigfoot here in the city.

390
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,440
<13-7,BECKETT>我不明白为什么她要跟你说这些事
<13-7,BECKETT>I don't understand why she would talk to you about something like that.

391
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,450
<13-8,DARRELL>安学的是进化生物学
<13-8,DARRELL>Well, Anne was studying evolutionary biology.

392
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,000
<13-8,DARRELL>她在大学是优秀学生
<13-8,DARRELL>She was an honor student at the university,

393
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,000
<13-8,DARRELL>但她实际上是位很有声望的大脚怪专家
<13-8,DARRELL>but she was actually a hugely respected bigfoot expert.

394
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,130
<13-9,DARRELL>她甚至给了我一支极为罕见的雪人的手指
<13-9,DARRELL>She even gave me that extremely rare yeti finger.

395
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,320
<13-10,CASTLE>你是说安是个大脚怪猎人吗
<13-10,CASTLE>Are you saying Anne was a bigfoot hunter?

396
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,370
<13-11,DARRELL>不  不是
<13-11,DARRELL>N-n-no, no.

397
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,740
<13-11,DARRELL>她不是猎人
<13-11,DARRELL>No, uh, no, not a--not a hunter.

398
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,030
<13-11,DARRELL>安是美国原住民
<13-11,DARRELL>No, uh, Anne was, uh, native American.

399
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,920
<13-11,DARRELL>在他们的部落文化中
<13-11,DARRELL>And, uh, in her tribe's culture,

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,780
<13-11,DARRELL>大脚怪被认为是善良的保护神
<13-11,DARRELL>a bigfoot was considered... benevolent or a protector.

401
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,710
<13-11,DARRELL>在她小时候  她亲眼见过一只大脚怪
<13-11,DARRELL>When she was a child, she actually saw a bigfoot,

402
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,410
<13-11,DARRELL>于是后来  她一生都致力于对他们的研究
<13-11,DARRELL>and so after that, she devoted her life to their study.

403
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,670
<13-11,DARRELL>抱歉
<13-11,DARRELL>Excuse me.

404
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,300
<13-12,CASTLE>大脚怪
<13-12,CASTLE>So are bigfoots--

405
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,890
<13-12,CASTLE>是残暴而且具有攻击性的吗
<13-12,CASTLE>or bigfeet-- uh, violent or aggressive?

406
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,890
<13-13,DARRELL>它们当然可以这样
<13-13,DARRELL>Well, they certainly can be.

407
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,400
<13-13,DARRELL>她受了怎样的伤
<13-13,DARRELL>What were the nature of her injuries?

408
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,660
<13-15,DARRELL>我是说  她是被大脚怪攻击的吗
<13-15,DARRELL>Well, I mean, was she attacked by a bigfoot?

409
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,790
<13-17,BECKETT>-不可能  -是的
<13-17,BECKETT>- Not a chance. - Yes.

410
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,530
<13-18,DARRELL>以科学的名义
<13-18,DARRELL>Well, in the name of science,

411
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,490
<13-18,DARRELL>你们能让我检查一下她死去的地方吗
<13-18,DARRELL>would you allow me to examine where she died?

412
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,370
<13-19,BECKETT>不行  就你所知
<13-19,BECKETT>No. Now as far as you're aware,

413
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,800
<13-19,BECKETT>她和除了大脚怪以外的哪个人有问题吗
<13-19,BECKETT>did she have issues with anyone other than bigfoot?

414
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,010
<13-20,DARRELL>她一直被高度监视着
<13-20,DARRELL>Well, she was under a very high level of scrutiny.

415
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,980
<13-21,BECKETT>谁在监视她
<13-21,BECKETT>Scrutiny from whom?

416
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,510
<13-22,GARLAND MEEKS>某个悬赏一百万美元的电视节目
<13-22,GARLAND MEEKS>Oh, some TV show offered a $1-million reward,

417
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,440
<13-22,GARLAND MEEKS>许多白痴为了奖金
<13-22,GARLAND MEEKS>which unleashed a tide of idiots,

418
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,860
<13-22,GARLAND MEEKS>都在寻找大脚怪
<13-22,GARLAND MEEKS>all searching for bigfoot.

419
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,270
<13-23,DARRELL>是的
<13-23,DARRELL>Yes, and, uh,

420
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,550
<13-23,DARRELL>这是我妻子嘉兰  她不相信大脚怪
<13-23,DARRELL>this is my wife Garland. Uh, she's the skeptical one.

421
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,880
<13-24,CASTLE>我能理解你的心情  很荣幸见到你
<13-24,CASTLE>Trust me. I feel your pain. Pleasure.

422
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,540
<13-25,DARRELL>不管怎样  我认为当人们发现
<13-25,DARRELL>In either case, I think when people found out

423
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,930
<13-25,DARRELL>安在这方面是专家时  他们就想跟着她
<13-25,DARRELL>Anne's area of expertise, they wanted to follow her

424
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,130
<13-25,DARRELL>看她是否能带他们找到真正的大脚怪
<13-25,DARRELL>to see if she would actually take them to a real bigfoot.

425
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,420
<13-26,BECKETT>要知道  安死的那天
<13-26,BECKETT>You know, the day that she died,

426
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,540
<13-26,BECKETT>有人看到她在和这个人争吵
<13-26,BECKETT>Anne was seen arguing with this man.

427
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,150
<13-26,BECKETT>你认识这个人吗
<13-26,BECKETT>Do you recognize him?

428
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,130
<13-27,GARLAND>当然  太认识了
<13-27,GARLAND>Oh, yes. All too well.

429
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,120
<13-28,DARRELL>这个人是大脚怪最大的敌人
<13-28,DARRELL>This man is the bigfoot community's worst enemy.

430
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,270
<14-1,ESPOSITO>他的名字叫蔡斯·迪金斯
<14-1,ESPOSITO>His name is Chase Diggins,

431
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,490
<14-1,ESPOSITO>他是个澳大利亚探险家
<14-1,ESPOSITO>and he's an Australian adventurer

432
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,700
<14-1,ESPOSITO>也是一个赏金猎人
<14-1,ESPOSITO>and big game hunter.

433
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,200
<14-2,RYAN>有点像鳄鱼邓迪  印第安纳·琼斯
<14-2,RYAN>Kind of Crocodile Dundee meets Indiana Jones

435
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,090
<14-2,RYAN>和泰德·纽金特的混合体
<14-2,RYAN>meets Ted Nugent.

436
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,320
<14-3,BECKETT>据米克斯夫妇称
<14-3,BECKETT>Now according to the Meekses,

437
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,330
<14-3,BECKETT>他是个暴力又极其易怒的人
<14-3,BECKETT>he's violent and highly unstable.

438
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,640
<14-4,ESPOSITO>而且这家伙拼命想捕获一只大脚怪
<14-4,ESPOSITO>What's more is that this guy is hell-bent on bagging a bigfoot.

439
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,540
<14-4,ESPOSITO>YouTube上有一段
<14-4,ESPOSITO>I found him on YouTube

440
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,390
<14-4,ESPOSITO>他夸口说要弄一只挂在自家墙上的视频
<14-4,ESPOSITO>bragging about how he's gonna mount one on his wall.

441
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,610
<14-5,BECKETT>除了和一个虚构的猿人有关的推测
<14-5,BECKETT>Do we have anything other than speculation

442
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,080
<14-5,BECKETT>我们还有别的东西
<14-5,BECKETT>on a mythical ape-man

443
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,750
<14-5,BECKETT>能把这个人和谋杀案联系起来吗
<14-5,BECKETT>that will connect him to the murder?

444
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,680
<14-6,ESPOSITO>我们有这个
<14-6,ESPOSITO>We have this.

445
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,370
<14-7,BECKETT>迪金斯有一支钩状的假肢
<14-7,BECKETT>Diggins has a prosthetic hook for a hand?

446
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,700
<14-8,RYAN>据说他因为大脚怪的攻击而失去了胳膊
<14-8,RYAN>Says he lost it in a bigfoot attack

447
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,610
<14-8,RYAN>而且他几乎
<14-8,RYAN>And that he almost took--

448
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,230
<14-9,ESPOSITO>不管发生了什么
<14-9,ESPOSITO>However it happened,

449
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,130
<14-9,ESPOSITO>可能就是这支钩子造成了安脸上的伤
<14-9,ESPOSITO>That hook could've been what did a number on Anne's face.

450
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,510
<14-10,BECKETT>他现在在哪里
<14-10,BECKETT>Where's Chase Diggins now?

451
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,710
<15-1,RYAN>这家伙是个国际探险家
<15-1,RYAN>This guy is an international adventurer.

452
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,890
<15-1,RYAN>他这是在搞什么鬼
<15-1,RYAN>What the hell is he doing?

453
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,710
<15-1,RYAN>租这么破烂的工业废墟住
<15-1,RYAN>Renting an industrial crap hole like this?

454
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,830
<15-1,RYAN>为什么不住旅馆
<15-1,RYAN>Why not a hotel?

455
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,260
<15-2,ESPOSITO>这家伙是大脚怪猎人
<15-2,ESPOSITO>The guy hunts bigfoot.

456
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,030
<15-2,ESPOSITO>我觉得他的行为跟理性
<15-2,ESPOSITO>I don't think that rational behavior

457
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,470
<15-2,ESPOSITO>没有一点儿关系
<15-2,ESPOSITO>is something he's familiar with.

458
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,000
<15-3,RYAN>你听见了吗
<15-3,RYAN>You hear that?

459
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,400
<15-4,ESPOSITO>听见了
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

<15-6,ESPOSITO>right now!

465
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,270
<15-5,RYAN>兄弟
<15-5,RYAN>Dude...

466
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,190
<15-7,RYAN>我有一种不祥的预感  伙计
<15-7,RYAN>I got a bad feeling about this thing, man.

467
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,250
<15-7,RYAN>我觉得我们不应该
<15-7,RYAN>I-I don't think that we should--

468
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,920
<15-8,CHASE DIGGINS>你们是在找我吗
<15-8,CHASE DIGGINS>You gents looking for me?

471
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,380
<16-1,CHASE>安真是太可惜了
<16-1,CHASE>A bloody shame about Anne.

472
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,370
<16-1,CHASE>她是个很棒的大脚怪追踪者
<16-1,CHASE>She was one hell of a tracker.

473
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,710
<16-1,CHASE>事实上  她是我来这座城市的唯一原因
<16-1,CHASE>Actually, the only reason I came to the city.

474
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,370
<16-1,CHASE>传言说她知道一只真正大脚怪的下落
<16-1,CHASE>Word was, she knew the whereabouts of an actual squatch,

475
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,040
<16-1,CHASE>我想也许她可以带我找到他
<16-1,CHASE>and I figured, she might lead me to him.

476
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,320
<16-2,BECKETT>你来纽约
<16-2,BECKETT>You came to new york

477
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,840
<16-2,BECKETT>追捕大脚怪
<16-2,BECKETT>to hunt bigfoot?

478
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,270
<16-3,CHASE>看到这个了吗  警探
<16-3,CHASE>You see this, detective?

479
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,430
<16-3,CHASE>2008年在尼泊尔
<16-3,CHASE>Nepal, 2008,

480
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,390
<16-3,CHASE>在喜马拉雅山脉的岩石峭壁中
<16-3,CHASE>in the rocky crags of the Himalayas...

481
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,740
<16-3,CHASE>一只大脚怪不知从哪冒出来
<16-3,CHASE>A squatch came out of nowhere

482
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,590
<16-3,CHASE>直接扯掉了我的胳膊
<16-3,CHASE>and ripped my arm clean off.

483
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,160
<16-3,CHASE>所以为了报仇我会一直追捕这些混蛋
<16-3,CHASE>So I will hunt down every last one of those bastards

484
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,710
<16-3,CHASE>直到它们被消灭
<16-3,CHASE>until I have my payback.

485
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,020
<16-4,CASTLE>大脚怪长什么样
<16-4,CASTLE>What did it look like?

486
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,650
<16-5,CHASE>重达五百磅长着毛的死神  伙计
<16-5,CHASE>500 pounds of fur and death, mate.

487
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,250
<16-5,CHASE>它的眼睛就像疯狗一样
<16-5,CHASE>Eyes like a rabid dog,

488
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,000
<16-5,CHASE>但它很聪明  你知道吗
<16-5,CHASE>but smart, you know?

489
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,820
<16-5,CHASE>无论如何  他们说她找到了一只
<16-5,CHASE>Anyway, they say that she found one.

490
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,640
<16-5,CHASE>人尽皆知  但安什么都不肯说
<16-5,CHASE>Everyone knew it, but Anne wasn't talking.

491
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,880
<16-6,BECKETT>这就是你去见她的原因吗
<16-6,BECKETT>Is that why you went to see her?

492
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,310
<16-7,CHASE>谁告诉你的
<16-7,CHASE>Who told you that?

493
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,940
<16-8,BECKETT>目击证人看到你和安昨天在她的
<16-8,BECKETT>Witnesses saw you and anne arguing

494
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,090
<16-8,BECKETT>工作地点外面争吵
<16-8,BECKETT>outside of her work yesterday.

495
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,150
<16-9,CHASE>那只不过是同事之间的礼貌对话而已
<16-9,CHASE>Merely a polite conversation between colleagues.

496
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,760
<16-9,CHASE>真的吗
<16-9,CHASE>Really?

497
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,600
<16-10,BECKETT>因为那晚的晚些时候  她就死了
<16-10,BECKETT>'cause later that night, she turned up dead.

498
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,220
<16-11,CHASE>你找错人了  警探
<16-11,CHASE>You're squattin' in the wrong bush, detective.

499
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,990
<16-11,CHASE>我昨晚和同伴们一起去了靶场
<16-11,CHASE>I was at a target range last night with my mates,

500
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,380
<16-11,CHASE>不想生了手
<16-11,CHASE>keeping my edge sharp.

501
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,790
<16-11,CHASE>你可以去查一下
<16-11,CHASE>You can check it out.

502
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,180
<16-12,BECKETT>这就有趣了  因为我们在那条巷子里
<16-12,BECKETT>That's funny, 'cause we found a boot print in alleyway

503
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,040
<16-12,BECKETT>安的血泊附近发现了和你穿的靴子
<16-12,BECKETT>near a pool of anne's blood with the same tread

504
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,520
<16-12,BECKETT>花纹一样的靴子印
<16-12,BECKETT>As the boots you're wearing now.

505
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,750
<16-13,CHASE>好吧  我确实去过那条巷子
<16-13,CHASE>All right, look, I was in that alley,

506
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,640
<16-13,CHASE>但不是昨晚  我是前天晚上去的
<16-13,CHASE>but not last night, it was the night before.

507
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,280
<16-14,CASTLE>你去那里做什么
<16-14,CASTLE>What were you doing there?

508
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,190
<16-15,CHASE>我想既然她在跟踪大脚怪
<16-15,CHASE>Well, I figured she was tracking the beast,

509
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,280
<16-15,CHASE>那我就跟踪她
<16-15,CHASE>so I tracked her.

510
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,330
<16-15,CHASE>我跟踪她去了小巷
<16-15,CHASE>I followed her to the alley, and...

511
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,840
<16-15,CHASE>正好把这个小妖精逮了个正着
<16-15,CHASE>That's when I caught the wily bitch in the act.

512
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,920
<16-16,BECKETT>她在干什么
<16-16,BECKETT>The act of what?

513
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,410
<16-17,CHASE>在地上印假大脚印
<16-17,CHASE>Stamping fake Squatch prints in the ground is what,

514
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,180
<16-17,CHASE>用的是大脚鞋模
<16-17,CHASE>using molds of giant feet.

515
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,500
<16-17,CHASE>她在伪造证据
<16-17,CHASE>She was faking the damn evidence.

516
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,950
<16-18,CASTLE>等等  等等
<16-18,CASTLE>Now, whoa. Okay, hang--

517
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,080
<16-18,CASTLE>安是个有威望的研究员
<16-18,CASTLE>Anne was a respected researcher.

518
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,150
<16-18,CASTLE>何必伪造大脚怪的证据呢
<16-18,CASTLE>Why would she fake evidence of bigfoot?

519
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,410
<16-19,CHASE>因为我认为她找到了真家伙
<16-19,CHASE>Because I reckon she found the real thing,

520
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,030
<16-19,CHASE>她试图糊弄我们其他人
<16-19,CHASE>and she was trying to throw the rest of us off the scent.

521
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,450
<16-19,CHASE>可我看穿了她  于是去她单位找她对质
<16-19,CHASE>But I was on to her, so I confronted her at work.

522
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,170
<16-19,CHASE>我让她尽管提要求  她让我滚开
<16-19,CHASE>Offered her anything she wanted, but she told me to bugger off.

523
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,380
<16-20,BECKETT>知道我怎么想的吗
<16-20,BECKETT>You know what I think?

524
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,230
<16-20,BECKETT>是你伪造了现场
<16-20,BECKETT>You faked that site.

525
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,320
<16-20,BECKETT>因为你扭曲的认为
<16-20,BECKETT>Because somewhere in your twisted mind,

526
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,310
<16-20,BECKETT>大脚怪的专家会被一只大脚怪害死
<16-20,BECKETT>it makes sense that the expert on bigfoot would be killed by one.

527
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,110
<16-21,CHASE>我就知道
<16-21,CHASE>I knew it.

528
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,930
<16-21,CHASE>她找到了
<16-21,CHASE>She found him.

529
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,860
<16-21,CHASE>这个小贱人找到了我的大脚怪
<16-21,CHASE>The little bitch found my bigfoot.

530
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,760
<17-1,BECKETT>听着  他不是疯了  就是在撒谎
<17-1,BECKETT>Look, he's either crazy or he's lying.

531
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,820
<17-2,ESPOSITO>我觉得他是疯了
<17-2,ESPOSITO>I'd go with crazy,

532
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,500
<17-2,ESPOSITO>因为看来他没说谎
<17-2,ESPOSITO>'cause it looks like he's telling the truth.

533
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,530
<17-2,ESPOSITO>他的假肢钩测试没发现安的DNA
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Tests on his prosthetic hook show no trace of Anne's D.N.A.

534
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,880
<17-2,ESPOSITO>而且他的不在场证明没问题  所以不是他
<17-2,ESPOSITO>And his alibi checks out. So it's not him.

535
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,330
<17-3,CASTLE>看来这位仁兄
<17-3,CASTLE>Well, it looks like we're back to this guy

536
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,760
<17-3,CASTLE>又成了我们的头号疑犯
<17-3,CASTLE>as our number one suspect.

537
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,620
<17-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  能劳烦你取下来吗
<17-4,BECKETT>Castle, could you please take that down?

538
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,540
<17-5,CASTLE>好
<17-5,CASTLE>You got it.

539
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,720
<17-6,ESPOSITO>化验室鉴定出
<17-6,ESPOSITO>The lab also was able to identify

540
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,190
<17-6,ESPOSITO>我们在死者头部伤口上找到的玻璃屑
<17-6,ESPOSITO>the glass shards we found in our victim's head wound.

541
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,420
<17-6,ESPOSITO>是摄像机镜头上的
<17-6,ESPOSITO>It's from a camera lens.

542
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,990
<17-7,CASTLE>犯罪现场没有摄像机
<17-7,CASTLE>There was no camera at the crime scene.

543
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,290
<17-8,BECKETT>或许是凶手拿走了
<17-8,BECKETT>Maybe our killer took it.

544
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,600
<17-9,CASTLE>难怪大脚怪的图片那么少
<17-9,CASTLE>Which would explain why there are so few photos of bigfoot.

545
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,200
<17-10,BECKETT>我是指人类杀手
<17-10,BECKETT>I meant our human killer.

546
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,040
<17-11,CASTLE>对
<17-11,CASTLE>Right.

547
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,490
<17-12,BECKETT>我们重新排查一下那条小巷
<17-12,BECKETT>Let's re-canvass near that alleyway,

548
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,890
<17-12,BECKETT>看能否找到那台摄像机
<17-12,BECKETT>see if we can find that camera.

549
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,680
<17-13,RYAN>我调查了安吞下的那个坠子
<17-13,RYAN>So I looked into the pendant that Anne swallowed,

550
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,940
<17-13,RYAN>发现了可疑处
<17-13,RYAN>and I found something strange.

551
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,750
<17-14,BECKETT>什么
<17-14,BECKETT>What?

552
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,460
<17-15,RYAN>我和她的朋友和邻里聊过
<17-15,RYAN>I talked to her friends and neighbors.

553
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,290
<17-15,RYAN>坠子不是安的  是贾丝婷·伯顿的
<17-15,RYAN>The pendant wasn't Anne's. It belonged to Justine Bolton,

554
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,300
<17-15,RYAN>是安去年就读休斯顿大学时的室友
<17-15,RYAN>Anne's roommate at Hudson University last year.

555
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,800
<17-16,BECKETT>她知道安怎么会有这个吊坠吗
<17-16,BECKETT>Does the roommate have any idea what Anne was doing with it?

556
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,440
<17-17,RYAN>我想问她来着  只是有个问题
<17-17,RYAN>Uh, I'd love to ask her, there's only one problem.

557
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,050
<17-17,RYAN>贾丝婷一年前被杀了
<17-17,RYAN>Justine was murdered a year ago.

558
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,930
<17-18,CASTLE>而一年后
<17-18,CASTLE>And a year later,

559
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,020
<17-18,CASTLE>她的坠子在她遇害的朋友的胃里被发现
<17-18,CASTLE>her pendant is found in her murdered friend's stomach?

560
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,120
<17-19,BECKETT>不会是巧合
<17-19,BECKETT>That can't be a coincidence.

561
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,100
<17-19,BECKETT>贾丝婷的谋杀案是怎么回事
<17-19,BECKETT>What do we know about Justine's murder?

562
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,440
<17-20,RYAN>我安排要了她的卷宗
<17-20,RYAN>Well, I ordered up her case files.

563
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,850
<17-20,RYAN>明天上午应该能到
<17-20,RYAN>They should be here by the morning.

564
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,560
<18-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不管你做了多少研究
<18-1,BECKETT>Look, Castle, i don't care how much research you do,

565
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,000
<18-1,BECKETT>你都无法让我相信有大脚怪的存在
<18-1,BECKETT>you're not gonna convince me that there's a bigfoot.

566
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,030
<18-2,CASTLE>我只是追查证据
<18-2,CASTLE>I just follow the evidence

567
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,320
<18-2,CASTLE>和超级大脚印
<18-2,CASTLE>and the insanely large footprints.

568
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,990
<18-3,BECKETT>有你不信的事物吗
<18-3,BECKETT>Is there anything that you don't believe in?

569
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,030
<18-4,CASTLE>当然有了  比如...
<18-4,CASTLE>Sure, there is. There's, um...

570
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,340
<18-5,CASTLE>好吧  那你呢
<18-5,CASTLE>Okay, well, what about you?

571
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,080
<18-5,CASTLE>如果你不信大脚  僵尸和鬼魂
<18-5,CASTLE>If not bigfoot or zombies or ghosts,

572
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,280
<18-5,CASTLE>那你信什么
<18-5,CASTLE>what do you believe in?

573
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,280
<18-6,BECKETT>我相信生活中不可思议的点滴
<18-6,BECKETT>I just--I believe in the everyday magic of life.

574
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,410
<18-6,BECKETT>我能看得见摸得着的东西
<18-6,BECKETT>I mean, things that I can see and touch,

575
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,900
<18-6,BECKETT>比如
<18-6,BECKETT>Like, um,

576
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,650
<18-6,BECKETT>二月从雪地里萌发出来的绿芽
<18-6,BECKETT>the green shoots that pop through the snow in February,

577
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,860
<18-6,BECKETT>熨斗大厦  还有...
<18-6,BECKETT>or the flatiron building, or...

578
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,230
<18-6,BECKETT>我听科特恩的歌时候的感觉  真是...
<18-6,BECKETT>The way that I feel when I hear Coltrane. It's...

579
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,120
<18-7,CASTLE>我也欣赏日常生活
<18-7,CASTLE>Now I can appreciate the everyday,

580
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,010
<18-7,CASTLE>为什么不能承认可能性呢
<18-7,CASTLE>but why not live in the possible?

581
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,460
<18-7,CASTLE>这个世界不像以前那么神秘了
<18-7,CASTLE>The world just doesn't have as many mysteries anymore.

582
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,310
<18-7,CASTLE>没有新大陆可以探索
<18-7,CASTLE>There's no new continents to explore.

583
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,070
<18-7,CASTLE>没有最深最黑暗的非洲去发现
<18-7,CASTLE>There's no more deepest, darkest Africa.

584
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,250
<18-7,CASTLE>所有这些都被卫星和定位仪在地图上标了出来
<18-7,CASTLE>Everything's all mapped out by satellites and sonar,

585
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,830
<18-7,CASTLE>不过  人们还在探索未知
<18-7,CASTLE>yet, still, people reach for the unknown.

586
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,340
<18-7,CASTLE>这让我们成长
<18-7,CASTLE>It's what makes us grow.

587
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,780
<18-7,CASTLE>要不是安托万·萨克斯富于想象
<18-7,CASTLE>Coltrane wouldn't have had that saxophone

588
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,860
<18-7,CASTLE>科特恩也不会有萨卡斯
<18-7,CASTLE>if Antoine Sax hadn't imagined it.

589
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,390
<18-7,CASTLE>那不是我们与
<18-7,CASTLE>Isn't that what separates us from, uh,

590
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,090
<18-7,CASTLE>动物的分别吗
<18-7,CASTLE>say Moonshine?

591
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,070
<18-8,BECKETT>有一个
<18-8,BECKETT>Well, you know, there is one...

592
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,420
<18-8,BECKETT>无法解释的
<18-8,BECKETT>Inexplicable...

593
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,050
<18-8,BECKETT>神秘现象我还坚信着
<18-8,BECKETT>Mysterious phenomenon that I do believe in still.

594
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,550
<18-8,BECKETT>我们
<18-8,BECKETT>Us.

595
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,090
<18-9,BECKETT>什么声音
<18-9,BECKETT>What was that?

596
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,080
<18-10,CASTLE>有东西触发了我的陷阱
<18-10,CASTLE>Something set off my trap.

597
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,090
<18-11,BECKETT>你设了陷阱
<18-11,BECKETT>You set a trap?

598
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,570
<18-12,CASTLE>-抓住你了  超级大鼠  -什么
<18-12,CASTLE>- I've got you now, you super rats. - What?

599
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,740
<18-14,CASTLE>没人可以偷我的东西
<18-14,CASTLE>No one steals from me.

600
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,970
<18-15,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<18-15,CASTLE>Alexis?

601
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,350
<18-16,CASTLE>你在干什么
<18-16,CASTLE>What are you doing here? Mm!

602
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,300
<19-1,CASTLE>她还是不接我的电话
<19-1,CASTLE>Yeah, she's still not taking my calls.

603
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,860
<19-2,BECKETT>这能怪她吗  卡塞尔
<19-2,BECKETT>Well, can you blame her, Castle?

604
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,030
<19-2,BECKETT>你把她弄成了蓝精灵
<19-2,BECKETT>You practically turned her into a smurf.

605
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,830
<19-3,CASTLE>纳美人更符合现代表述[《阿凡达》]
<19-3,CASTLE>Na'vi would be a more contemporary reference.

606
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,030
<19-3,CASTLE>不  重点是  她骗了我
<19-3,CASTLE>No, the point is, she lied to me.

607
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,730
<19-3,CASTLE>她正视着我的眼睛
<19-3,CASTLE>She looked me right in the eye

608
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,080
<19-3,CASTLE>说是别人的错
<19-3,CASTLE>and she blamed the borrowers.

609
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,430
<19-4,BECKETT>我相信她有理由
<19-4,BECKETT>I'm sure she had a good reason.

610
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,300
<19-5,CASTLE>什么理由  没吃的吗
<19-5,CASTLE>For what, not having food?

611
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,040
<19-5,CASTLE>我给了她很多零花钱
<19-5,CASTLE>I mean, I give her a sizeable allowance.

612
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,170
<19-5,CASTLE>如果不够的话  她随时可以问我要
<19-5,CASTLE>And if that's not enough, she can always ask for more.

613
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,010
<19-6,BECKETT>我说了  卡塞尔
<19-6,BECKETT>Like I said, Castle,

614
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,740
<19-6,BECKETT>每天都充满了神秘
<19-6,BECKETT>there are plenty of mysteries in the everyday.

615
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,730
<19-6,BECKETT>莱恩
<19-6,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan,

616
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,120
<19-6,BECKETT>贾丝婷·伯顿的卷宗来了吗
<19-6,BECKETT>Has Justine Bolton's murder file come in yet?

617
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,830
<19-6,BECKETT>她在和安·卡蒂诺同住的公寓
<19-6,BECKETT>She was attacked in the apartment

618
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,520
<19-7,RYAN>遭到了攻击
<19-7,RYAN>that she shared with Anne Cardinal.

619
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,010
<19-7,RYAN>她窒息的方式和伤痕
<19-7,RYAN>The way she was choked and bruised,

620
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,780
<19-7,RYAN>像是冲动犯罪
<19-7,RYAN>looked like it was a crime of passion.

621
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,000
<19-8,BECKETT>有嫌疑人吗
<19-8,BECKETT>Do they have a suspect?

622
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,340
<19-9,RYAN>可惜逃了
<19-9,RYAN>Unfortunately, he fled,

623
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,010
<19-9,RYAN>而且案发之后再没别人看到
<19-9,RYAN>and he hasn't been seen since the murder.

624
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,310
<19-10,CASTLE>他会不会留着蓬松长发  人高马大吗
<19-10,CASTLE>Any chance he had long, shaggy hair and he was 8 feet tall?

625
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,770
<19-11,RYAN>不是  很遗憾  卡塞尔
<19-11,RYAN>Uh, no. Sorry, Castle.

626
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,080
<19-11,RYAN>是贾丝婷的男友  科特·威尔森
<19-11,RYAN>It was Justine's boyfriend-- Kurt Wilson.

627
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,440
<19-11,RYAN>他据称是发现尸体的人
<19-11,RYAN>He was the one that supposedly found the body.

628
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,450
<19-11,RYAN>他是个橄榄球运动员
<19-11,RYAN>He was a football player

629
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,040
<19-11,RYAN>场内场外都有伤人的前科
<19-11,RYAN>with a history of assaults on and off the field.

630
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,300
<19-11,RYAN>贾丝婷似乎想要摆脱他
<19-11,RYAN>It looked like Justine was trying to get away from him.

631
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,240
<19-11,RYAN>她遇害那天  她找了系主任
<19-11,RYAN>The day that she was murdered, she contacted the dean

632
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,030
<19-11,RYAN>说她打算退学
<19-11,RYAN>and told him that she was dropping out of school

633
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,790
<19-11,RYAN>尽管她在班上名列前茅
<19-11,RYAN>even though she was top of her class.

634
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,140
<19-11,RYAN>等到警察发现
<19-11,RYAN>By the time the cops realized

635
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,800
<19-11,RYAN>所有线索都指向科特·威尔森时  他失踪了
<19-11,RYAN>that all roads led to Kurt Wilson, he disappeared.

636
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,850
<19-12,CASTLE>安怎么发现的
<19-12,CASTLE>How does Anne figure into this?

637
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,130
<19-13,RYAN>作为她的室友
<19-13,RYAN>Well, as her roommate,

638
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,830
<19-13,RYAN>安对贾丝婷的死感到非常难过
<19-13,RYAN>it looks like Anne took Justine's death pretty hard.

639
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,950
<19-13,RYAN>我跟案子的负责人谈话时  他告诉我
<19-13,RYAN>When I spoke to the lead detective, he told me

640
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,310
<19-13,RYAN>她几个月前曾找过他
<19-13,RYAN>she came to him a few months back

641
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,930
<19-13,RYAN>想要看贾丝婷案的档案
<19-13,RYAN>and asked to see Justine's case file.

642
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,850
<19-13,RYAN>他拒绝了她  因为那是没破的凶案
<19-13,RYAN>He refused since it's a pending murder case,

643
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,800
<19-13,RYAN>但这说明了
<19-13,RYAN>But still, it means--

644
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,660
<19-14,BECKETT>安在查贾丝婷的案子
<19-14,BECKETT>Anne was looking into Justine's murder.

645
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,850
<19-15,CASTLE>几个月前  那正是安退学的时候
<19-15,CASTLE>And a few months ago--that's when Anne took time off school.

646
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,230
<19-16,BECKETT>这么说  安可能不是在找大脚怪
<19-16,BECKETT>So then maybe Anne wasn't tracking down bigfoot.

647
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,000
<19-16,BECKETT>她是在找科特·威尔森
<19-16,BECKETT>She was looking for Kurt Wilson.

648
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
<19-17,RYAN>搞不好她找到他了
<19-17,RYAN>Maybe she found him.

649
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,100
<19-17,RYAN>排查没有找到安的相机
<19-17,RYAN>Canvass didn't turn up Anne's camera,

650
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,110
<19-18,ESPOSITO>但实验室的人发现了镜头上的序列号
<19-18,ESPOSITO>but the lab came back with a serial number on that lens.

651
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,140
<19-18,ESPOSITO>是某一型号的摄像机专用的——
<19-18,ESPOSITO>Now it was made for a specific model--

652
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,570
<19-18,ESPOSITO>无线网络摄像机
<19-18,ESPOSITO>A Wi-Fi-enable camcorder

653
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,540
<19-18,ESPOSITO>它可以实现云同步
<19-18,ESPOSITO>that's designed to synch up to a cloud account.

654
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,700
<19-18,ESPOSITO>我查了  安在云服务器里有个账号
<19-18,ESPOSITO>I checked. Anne has a cloud account.

655
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,190
<19-19,BECKETT>能打开看看吗
<19-19,BECKETT>Can we access it?

656
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,000
<20-1,ANNE>测试  一  二  三
<20-1,ANNE>Testing, one, two, three.

657
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,290
<20-1,ANNE>好嘞
<20-1,ANNE>Okay, good.

658
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,540
<20-2,BECKETT>你看时间记录
<20-2,BECKETT>Look at the time stamp.

659
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,410
<20-3,ESPOSITO>半夜12:20  她死的那晚
<20-3,ESPOSITO>12:20 a.m. The night she died.

660
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,860
<20-4,CASTLE>-天呐  天呐  -是啊  不过她不在巷子里
<20-4,CASTLE>- Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - Yeah, but she's not in an alley.

661
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,370
<20-5,ANNE>-她这是在哪儿啊  -有人追我  有人追我
<20-5,ANNE>- Where the hell is she? - He's after me. He's after me.

662
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,050
<20-5,ANNE>求你  不
<20-5,ANNE>Oh, please! No!

663
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,000
<21-1,BECKETT>看来凶案发生在树林里  而不是巷子里
<21-1,BECKETT>So the attack took place in the woods, not that alley.

664
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,830
<21-1,BECKETT>但我们得找到这树林在哪儿
<21-1,BECKETT>But what we need to find out is where these woods are.

665
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,950
<21-2,ESPOSITO>技术科的人正在分析相机的定位信息
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Tech is trying to get the geodata off that footage

666
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,850
<21-2,ESPOSITO>看看能不能找出确切的位置
<21-2,ESPOSITO>to see if we can pinpoint the exact coordinates.

667
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,490
<21-3,RYAN>但如果她是在林子里被害的
<21-3,RYAN>But if she was attacked in the woods somewhere,

668
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,660
<21-3,RYAN>为何要把她扔进巷子
<21-3,RYAN>why move her to an alley?

669
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,630
<21-4,BECKETT>因为凶手想要混淆视听
<21-4,BECKETT>Because the killer was trying to throw us off his trail.

670
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,410
<21-4,BECKETT>如果安是在找科特·威尔森
<21-4,BECKETT>If Anne was looking for Kurt Wilson,

671
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,020
<21-4,BECKETT>那他最不想要的
<21-4,BECKETT>then the last thing he would want to do

672
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,230
<21-4,BECKETT>就是把她的尸体留在
<21-4,BECKETT>is leave her body near the same spot

673
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,520
<21-4,BECKETT>自己的藏身之处
<21-4,BECKETT>where he was hiding out.

674
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,930
<21-5,CASTLE>除非她是在林子里找别的东西
<21-5,CASTLE>Unless she was looking for someone else in those woods.

675
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,110
<21-6,ESPOSITO>浑身长毛的东西
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Something with fur?

676
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,770
<21-7,CASTLE>来看看视频里的凶手长什么样子
<21-7,CASTLE>What do we really see of our killer in this video?

677
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,710
<21-7,CASTLE>他黑不溜秋  若隐若现
<21-7,CASTLE>He's dark, looming,

678
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,660
<21-7,CASTLE>孔武有力  拿着原始的武器
<21-7,CASTLE>powerful, holding a primitive weapon.

679
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,260
<21-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那是个人
<21-8,BECKETT>Castle, that is a person.

680
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,390
<21-9,CASTLE>我看到的是一个笨拙人形生物的影子
<21-9,CASTLE>All I see is the silhouette of a hulking, humanoid form.

681
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,110
<21-9,CASTLE>如果达雷尔·米克斯和那个独臂澳洲人是对的
<21-9,CASTLE>If Darrell Meeks and that one-armed Aussie were right

682
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,590
<21-9,CASTLE>安的确知道大脚怪在哪儿的话
<21-9,CASTLE>and Anne did know where bigfoot was,

683
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,560
<21-9,CASTLE>那视频里的可能就是他
<21-9,CASTLE>Well, that could be him on that video.

684
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,130
<21-10,BECKETT>然后呢  大脚怪背着她的尸体离开森林
<21-10,BECKETT>Then what, bigfoot carried her body into the city on foot

685
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,260
<21-10,BECKETT>徒步走进城里
<21-10,BECKETT>from wherever these woods are

686
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,100
<21-10,BECKETT>把她扔进巷子里吗
<21-10,BECKETT>and left her in that alleyway?

687
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,200
<21-11,CASTLE>这可是你自己说的
<21-11,CASTLE>Well, you said yourself,

688
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,810
<21-11,CASTLE>既然科特·威尔森不想把安的尸体
<21-11,CASTLE>Kurt Wilson wouldn't want to leave Anne's body

689
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,650
<21-11,CASTLE>留在自己的藏身之地
<21-11,CASTLE>where he'd been hiding out.

690
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,970
<21-11,CASTLE>大脚怪也不想啊
<21-11,CASTLE>Why would bigfoot?

691
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,000
<21-12,BECKETT>好  你们把威尔森的照片
<21-12,BECKETT>Okay. Why don't you guys circulate Wilson's photo

692
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,440
<21-12,BECKETT>给安的家人和朋友看看
<21-12,BECKETT>to Anne's family and friends

693
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,040
<21-12,BECKETT>问问他们最近有没见过他
<21-12,BECKETT>and see if anyone has seen him around?

694
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,510
<21-12,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去找技术科的人
<21-12,BECKETT>Castle and I will talk to tech

695
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,720
<21-12,BECKETT>看看能不能找到这树林在哪儿
<21-12,BECKETT>to see if we can figure out where these woods are.

696
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,940
<22-1,FRANCO>说不准  可能见过吧
<22-1,FRANCO>I don't know. Maybe.

697
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,250
<22-1,FRANCO>要是再邋遢点儿
<22-1,FRANCO>If you rough him up a little, he could be

698
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,740
<22-1,FRANCO>有点儿像我在停车场见过的一个流浪汉
<22-1,FRANCO>that homeless guy I saw hanging out in the parking garage.

699
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,690
<22-2,ESPOSITO>什么时候见到的
<22-2,ESPOSITO>When was that?

700
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,280
<22-3,FRANCO>上个星期
<22-3,FRANCO>Last week sometime.

701
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,280
<22-4,RYAN>他当时在干嘛
<22-4,RYAN>What was he doing?

702
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,890
<22-5,FRANCO>没干嘛
<22-5,FRANCO>Nothing, man.

703
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,750
<22-5,FRANCO>看起来是在等什么
<22-5,FRANCO>He just looked like he was waiting.

704
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,380
<22-6,RYAN>我们想要
<22-6,RYAN>Well, we're gonna need, uh,

705
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,740
<22-6,RYAN>停车场的监控录像
<22-6,RYAN>security cam footage of the garage.

706
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,390
<22-7,FRANCO>那是安保公司负责的  我把他们的电话给你
<22-7,FRANCO>It's run by a separate company. I'll get you their number.

707
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,910
<22-8,ESPOSITO>如果威尔森知道安在追查他
<22-8,ESPOSITO>If Wilson knew that Anne was after him,

708
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,070
<22-8,ESPOSITO>他可能会跟踪她  准备杀掉她
<22-8,ESPOSITO>he might have been following her, preparing to kill her.

709
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,200
<22-8,ESPOSITO>我去安排警员排查
<22-8,ESPOSITO>I'll set up a canvass

710
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,350
<22-9,RYAN>把那个区域的交通监控录像都找来
<22-9,RYAN>and pull traffic cam footage from that area.

711
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,920
<22-9,RYAN>说不定能发现
<22-9,RYAN>Maybe we can get a hit on

712
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,980
<22-9,RYAN>他在离开停车场后去了哪儿
<22-9,RYAN>where he went after he left that garage.

713
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,620
<22-9,RYAN>测试  一  二  三
<22-9,RYAN>Testing, one, two, three.

714
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,550
<23-1,ANNE>好嘞
<23-1,ANNE>Okay, good.

715
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,100
<23-2,TECH>她一开始拍摄
<23-2,TECH>The camera began synching to her account

716
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,500
<23-2,TECH>摄像机就开始传输数据了
<23-2,TECH>right when she started filming.

717
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,970
<23-2,TECH>我们没找到定位信息
<23-2,TECH>We couldn't pull any geodata,

718
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,070
<23-2,TECH>但数据同步是通过手机完成的
<23-2,TECH>but the synch was routed through her cell phone.

719
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,950
<23-2,TECH>是经这个手机信号站传送的
<23-2,TECH>It pinged off this cell tower here.

720
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
<23-3,BECKETT>信号站附近有森林吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Are there any woods near that tower?

721
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,160
<23-4,TECH>有  是片一万英亩的自然保护区
<23-4,TECH>Yes, in a 10,000-acre nature preserve...

722
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,550
<23-4,TECH>叫布兰奇森林
<23-4,TECH>called Branch Cross.

723
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,260
<23-5,CASTLE>那是大脚怪的理想栖息地
<23-5,CASTLE>That's a perfect hangout for bigfoot.

724
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,090
<23-5,CASTLE>或者逃犯的
<23-5,CASTLE>Or the fugitive.

725
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,280
<23-6,BECKETT>有没有办法缩小
<23-6,BECKETT>Now is there any way to narrow down

726
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,470
<23-6,BECKETT>她拍摄视频的可能位置呢
<23-6,BECKETT>where she was when this was being filmed?

727
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,570
<23-7,TECH>缩不到理想的范围
<23-7,TECH>Not as much as I'd like,

728
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,090
<23-7,TECH>根据林业部门的说法
<23-7,TECH>but checked with the forest service,

729
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,640
<23-7,TECH>视频中的树木品种
<23-7,TECH>the species of tree in the video...

730
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,160
<23-7,TECH>大都生长在这片六平方英里的区域
<23-7,TECH>grow mostly in this 6-square-mile area.

731
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,380
<23-7,TECH>同时我们分析了月亮的方位
<23-7,TECH>Also, between the moon's position in the sky

732
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,080
<23-7,TECH>以及阴影的朝向
<23-7,TECH>and the orientation of the shadows,

733
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,500
<23-7,TECH>我可以告诉你  她是朝着
<23-7,TECH>I can tell you that she was moving

734
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,280
<23-7,TECH>东南方行走的
<23-7,TECH>in a southeasterly direction.

735
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,800
<23-8,CASTLE>她真厉害
<23-8,CASTLE>Wow. She's good.

736
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,420
<23-9,BECKETT>能调大视频的音量吗
<23-9,BECKETT>Could you turn up the volume on the video?

737
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,120
<23-10,BECKETT>-你们听得到背景声音吗  -天呐  天呐
<23-10,BECKETT>- Do you guys hear that in the background? - Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

738
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,990
<23-11,ANNE>有人追我  有人追我
<23-11,ANNE>He's after me. He's after me.

739
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,420
<23-12,BECKETT>能把它分离出来吗
<23-12,BECKETT>Do you think you can isolate that?

740
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,440
<23-13,CASTLE>像是水声
<23-13,CASTLE>That sounds like water.

741
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,630
<23-13,CASTLE>附近有河流和泉水吗
<23-13,CASTLE>Are there any streams or rivers nearby?

742
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,720
<23-14,TECH>这儿有
<23-14,TECH>Right there.

743
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,100
<23-14,TECH>她肯定是在小溪附近
<23-14,TECH>She must have been near that creek,

744
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,800
<23-14,TECH>这样范围缩小到两平方英里了
<23-14,TECH>which gets us down to a 2-square-mile area.

745
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,360
<23-15,BECKETT>好消息是  我们找到罪案现场了
<23-15,BECKETT>Well, the good news is, we have our crime scene.

746
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,330
<23-15,BECKETT>坏消息是
<23-15,BECKETT>The bad news is,

747
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,450
<23-15,BECKETT>它在一片深山老林里
<23-15,BECKETT>it's in 2 square miles of remote wilderness

748
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,480
<23-15,BECKETT>连路都没有
<23-15,BECKETT>with no access by road.

749
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,690
<23-16,CASTLE>你喜欢徒步野游吗
<23-16,CASTLE>You up for a hike?

750
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,630
<23-16,CASTLE>我可是徒步好手
<23-16,CASTLE>Oh, I'm well equipped for a hike.

751
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,080
<24-1,BECKETT>你这是干嘛
<24-1,BECKETT>What are you doing?

752
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,940
<24-2,CASTLE>敲敲木头喊个嗓子
<24-2,CASTLE>Knocking on wood and vocalizing.

753
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,810
<24-2,CASTLE>大脚怪就是这么远距离交流的
<24-2,CASTLE>It's how bigfoot communicates over long distances.

754
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,650
<24-2,CASTLE>真正的大脚怪猎人也这么引它们出来
<24-2,CASTLE>And how the real bigfoot hunters lure him out.

755
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,720
<24-3,BECKETT>真正的警察可不这么干
<24-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, the real police don't do it

756
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,240
<24-3,BECKETT>以防打草惊蛇
<24-3,BECKETT>so that our human fugitive won't know that we're coming.

757
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,370
<24-4,CASTLE>相信我
<24-4,CASTLE>Oh, trust me.

758
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,980
<24-4,CASTLE>如果科特·威尔森在这地方藏了一年
<24-4,CASTLE>If Kurt Wilson has been hiding out here for a year,

759
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,460
<24-4,CASTLE>我们就找不到他了
<24-4,CASTLE>we are not gonna find him.

760
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,840
<24-5,BECKETT>我们快到了
<24-5,BECKETT>Okay, we're close.

761
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,300
<24-5,BECKETT>GPS显示这就是袭击的大概方位
<24-5,BECKETT>GPS is showing that this is the general area of the attack.

762
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,580
<24-5,BECKETT>我们只需要找到一些标志地点就可以
<24-5,BECKETT>We just need to find some landmarks.

763
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,960
<24-6,BECKETT>发生地点就在枯树边上
<24-6,BECKETT>It happened by this downed tree,

764
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,620
<24-6,BECKETT>我们找到了树
<24-6,BECKETT>So all we gotta do is find the tree,

765
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,590
<24-6,BECKETT>也就找到了犯罪现场
<24-6,BECKETT>and we've found our crime scene.

766
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,890
<24-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  求你了  别学武基人叫了
<24-7,BECKETT>Castle, Castle, please. No more wookiee calls.

768
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,410
<24-8,CASTLE>才不是武基呢  我没学武基
<24-8,CASTLE>It's not wookiee. I'm not doing wookiee.

769
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,620
<24-8,CASTLE>我不会武基  但我闺女学得很可爱
<24-8,CASTLE>I can't do wookiee. Alexis does a really cute wookiee.

770
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,480
<24-9,BECKETT>无论你在做什么  能不能消停会儿
<24-9,BECKETT>Well, whatever you're doing, could you stop?

771
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,710
<24-10,CASTLE>你是怕它会有效
<24-10,CASTLE>You scared it might work?

772
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,540
<24-11,BECKETT>才不  我是怕我会杀了你
<24-11,BECKETT>No, I am scared that I might murder you,

773
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,060
<24-11,BECKETT>这样一来我就得处理两起谋杀案了
<24-11,BECKETT>and then I'll have two crime scenes on my hands.

774
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,280
<24-12,CASTLE>你知道  许多备受尊敬的人
<24-12,CASTLE>You know, a lot of highly respected individuals

775
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,310
<24-12,CASTLE>都相信大脚怪
<24-12,CASTLE>believe in bigfoot.

777
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,260
<24-12,CASTLE>泰迪·罗斯福在日记里就写了它
<24-12,CASTLE>Teddy Roosevelt wrote about him in his journals.

779
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,750
<24-12,CASTLE>简·古道尔就公开表明
<24-12,CASTLE>Jane Goodall has gone on record

780
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,820
<24-12,CASTLE>她对其存在可能持开放态度
<24-12,CASTLE>saying that she's open to the possibility.

781
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,710
<24-12,CASTLE>此刻
<24-12,CASTLE>And right now, as we speak,

782
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,640
<24-12,CASTLE>牛津大学的教授
<24-12,CASTLE>Professors at Oxford

783
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,390
<24-12,CASTLE>就在研究大脚怪的DNA样本
<24-12,CASTLE>are studying bigfoot D.N.A. samples.

784
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,140
<24-12,CASTLE>它们的存在是可能的
<24-12,CASTLE>No, it is possible.

785
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,920
<24-12,CASTLE>你只需要保持开放的态度
<24-12,CASTLE>You just have to be open to it...

786
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,560
<24-12,CASTLE>因为任何时候
<24-12,CASTLE>because at any moment,

787
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,300
<24-12,CASTLE>生活都会给你惊喜

792
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,890
<25-4,CASTLE>某种陷阱里
<25-4,CASTLE>Some kind of trap.

793
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,080
<25-5,BECKETT>我们得逃出去
<25-5,BECKETT>Which we've gotta get out of.

<25-9,BECKETT>You know what, Castle?

804
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,540
<25-10,BECKETT>你举我一把我就能自己爬出去
<25-10,BECKETT>I can pull myself out if you could boost me up.

805
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,280
<25-11,CASTLE>那我怎么出去
<25-11,CASTLE>Well, then how am I gonna get out?

806
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,000
<25-12,BECKETT>我车里有绳子
<25-12,BECKETT>I have a rope in the car.

807
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,590
<25-12,BECKETT>我走回去拿
<25-12,BECKETT>I was gonna hike back to get it.

808
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,070
<25-13,CASTLE>你就把我一个人留在这里
<25-13,CASTLE>You're gonna leave me here alone?

809
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,430
<25-13,CASTLE>好吧  等一下
<25-13,CASTLE>Okay, whoa. Just hold on a second.

810
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,460
<25-13,CASTLE>我们退回来想一想
<25-13,CASTLE>Let's just back up and think about this.

811
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,610
<25-13,CASTLE>这坑怎么就在这儿呢
<25-13,CASTLE>What is this pit doing out here in the first place?

812
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,810
<25-14,BECKETT>有人或者是
<25-14,BECKETT>Someone or...

813
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,440
<25-14,BECKETT>有东西建了它
<25-14,BECKETT>something had to build it.

814
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,310
<25-14,BECKETT>"东西"  卡塞尔
<25-14,BECKETT>"Something," Castle?

815
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,330
<25-14,BECKETT>你觉得大脚怪自带铲子到这儿的
<25-14,BECKETT>You think that bigfoot came out here with a shovel?

816
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,390
<25-15,CASTLE>不  你没准是对的
<25-15,CASTLE>No, you're probably right.

817
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,710
<25-15,CASTLE>我觉得不是大脚怪建的
<25-15,CASTLE>I don't think bigfoot built this.

818
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,630
<25-16,BECKETT>没准是一些猎人或者是偷猎者挖的
<25-16,BECKETT>Yeah, some hunters or poachers probably dug it up.

819
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,670
<25-17,CASTLE>抓什么  你看看这坑的大小
<25-17,CASTLE>Hunting what? Look at the size of this thing.

820
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,720
<25-18,BECKETT>没准是逃犯为了防止人来才建的
<25-18,BECKETT>Maybe our fugitive built it in case anyone came out here.

821
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,680
<25-19,CASTLE>我还是觉得大脚怪的推理比较好
<25-19,CASTLE>I'm more comfort with the idea of bigfoot building it.

822
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,770
<25-19,CASTLE>行了  卡塞尔
<25-19,CASTLE>Come on, Castle.

823
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,760
<25-20,BECKETT>你先半蹲怎么样
<25-20,BECKETT>Why don't you pop a squat?

824
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,580
<25-20,BECKETT>-我们来个拉拉队的动作  -好吧
<25-20,BECKETT>- We'll pull a cheerleader move. - Right.

825
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,010
<25-21,CASTLE>你不是应该穿个超短裙吗
<25-21,CASTLE>Shouldn't you be wearing a short skirt for this?

826
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,800
<25-21,CASTLE>上吧
<25-21,CASTLE>It's the move.

827
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,340
<25-22,CASTLE>你知道  这个坑虽然有点粗糙
<25-22,CASTLE>You know, though, this pit is kind of crudely built.

828
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,810
<25-22,CASTLE>但是  有一些灵长类动物
<25-22,CASTLE>And, uh, some primates have been known to...

829
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,770
<25-22,CASTLE>喜欢在这种地方
<25-22,CASTLE>make and...

830
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,260
<25-22,CASTLE>老天  卡塞尔
<25-22,CASTLE>Oh, jeez! Castle!

831
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,890
<25-22,CASTLE>使用工具来诱捕猎物
<25-22,CASTLE>use tools to trap prey.

832
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,410
<25-23,BECKETT>你能别动吗  抓紧我
<25-23,BECKETT>Would you stand still? Hold me.

833
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,980
<25-24,BECKETT>使劲
<25-24,BECKETT>Now.

834
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,860
<25-25,CASTLE>我是说
<25-25,CASTLE>Yeah, I'm just saying,

835
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,250
<25-25,CASTLE>我可不想成为大脚怪的盘中餐
<25-25,CASTLE>I don't want to end up as bigfoot dinner.

836
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,900
<25-26,BECKETT>你知道吗  卡塞尔
<25-26,BECKETT>You know, Castle,

837
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,050
<25-26,BECKETT>现在真是一种报应呢
<25-26,BECKETT>there is a bit of poetic justice in this.

838
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,040
<25-27,CASTLE>怎么就是报应了
<25-27,CASTLE>Poetic justice how?

839
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,510
<25-28,BECKETT>我说你仔细想想
<25-28,BECKETT>Well, I mean, think about it.

840
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,230
<25-28,BECKETT>你给阿丽克西斯设了陷阱
<25-28,BECKETT>You set a trap for Alexis,

841
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,650
<25-28,BECKETT>现在有人
<25-28,BECKETT>and now someone

842
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,290
<25-28,BECKETT>或者有东西给你设了陷阱
<25-28,BECKETT>or something has set one for you.

843
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,140
<25-29,CASTLE>答应我你会回来
<25-29,CASTLE>Promise me you'll come back.

844
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,350
<25-30,BECKETT>以防我没及时回来
<25-30,BECKETT>In case I don't make it.

845
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,590
<25-31,CASTLE>真有意思啊
<25-31,CASTLE>Oh, that's cute.

846
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,980
<25-31,CASTLE>没开玩笑  快点回来
<25-31,CASTLE>But seriously, hurry back!

847
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,430
<25-32,CASTLE>好吗
<25-32,CASTLE>'kay?

848

<26-2,RYAN>Nothing. What do you got?

850
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,330
<26-3,ESPOSITO>拿上外套
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Grab your coat.

851
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,210
<26-3,ESPOSITO>有人发现科特·威尔森了
<26-3,ESPOSITO>We got a hit on that photo of Kurt Wilson.

852
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,400
<26-3,ESPOSITO>安的邻居刚看到他
<26-3,ESPOSITO>One of Anne's neighbors just saw him

853
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,770
<26-3,ESPOSITO>进入了她的公寓
<26-3,ESPOSITO>go into her apartment.

<26-3,ESPOSITO>威尔森  纽约警局
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Hey, Wilson. NYPD.

855
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,550
<27-1,RYAN>逃跑的技术不怎么样啊  威尔森
<27-1,RYAN>Not much of a running back there, Wilson,

856
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,230
<27-2,ESPOSITO>毕竟缺乏锻炼
<27-2,ESPOSITO>But then, you're out of training.

857
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,830
<27-3,RYAN>好了  走吧
<27-3,RYAN>All right. Let's go.

858
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,880
<27-3,RYAN>我们抓到他了  他什么都不说
<27-3,RYAN>We got him, and he's not talking.

859
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,030
<28-1,RYAN>你想让我们怎么办
<28-1,RYAN>What do you want us to do?

860
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,960
<28-2,BECKETT>好  查查他的衣服上有没有安的血迹
<28-2,BECKETT>Okay, check his clothes for Anne's blood.

861
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,510
<28-3,RYAN>你们的犯罪现场找得怎么样
<28-3,RYAN>How you guys doing on the crime scene?

862
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,710
<28-4,BECKETT>我们碰上了点意外
<28-4,BECKETT>We ran into a little snag,

863
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,660
<28-4,BECKETT>但是等我们找到了
<28-4,BECKETT>but when we find it,

864
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,900
<28-4,BECKETT>希望我们会找到证据
<28-4,BECKETT>Hopefully we'll find evidence

865
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,280
<28-4,BECKETT>将命案与科特·威尔森联系起来
<28-4,BECKETT>that leads us straight to Kurt Wilson,

866
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,000
<28-4,BECKETT>这样我们就不需要他说话了
<28-4,BECKETT>and we won't need him to talk.

867

<29-1,CASTLE>哦  小叉子

893
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,740
<31-1,CASTLE>太令人失望了
<31-1,CASTLE>Well, this is a huge disappointment.

894
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,890
<31-2,DARRELL>不  这是个天大的误会
<31-2,DARRELL>No, this is a big misunderstanding.

895
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,880
<31-3,BECKETT>是吗
<31-3,BECKETT>Is it?

896
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,660
<31-3,BECKETT>那爪子
<31-3,BECKETT>'cause those claws

897
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,140
<31-3,BECKETT>完全能够造成安脸上的伤
<31-3,BECKETT>could've easily caused Anne's injuries.

898
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,770
<31-4,DARRELL>什么  我决不会伤害安
<31-4,DARRELL>What? I'd never hurt Anne.

899
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,300
<31-5,BECKETT>你这身装扮出现在
<31-5,BECKETT>Do you actually expect us to believe that

900
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,110
<31-5,BECKETT>她被袭击的现场
<31-5,BECKETT>with you dressed up in this... getup

901
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,510
<31-5,BECKETT>还指望我们相信你的话吗
<31-5,BECKETT>right in the same area where she was attacked?

902
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,520
<31-6,DARRELL>等等  她是在这被袭击的吗
<31-6,DARRELL>Wait. Sh-she was attacked here?

903
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,260
<31-6,DARRELL>我以为是在城里
<31-6,DARRELL>I-I-I thought she was attacked in the city.

904
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,320
<31-7,BECKETT>不是
<31-7,BECKETT>No.

905
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,770
<31-7,BECKETT>好吧
<31-7,BECKETT>Okay.

906
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,080
<31-8,DARRELL>好吧  好吧
<31-8,DARRELL>Okay, okay.

907
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,870
<31-8,DARRELL>情况看来很糟
<31-8,DARRELL>This looks bad.

908
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,890
<31-8,DARRELL>让我尽量解释一下  好吗
<31-8,DARRELL>Let me--let me just try and explain. Okay?

909
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,780
<31-8,DARRELL>我知道安要独自来这儿
<31-8,DARRELL>I knew that Anne was coming out here on her own,

910
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,130
<31-8,DARRELL>我承认我跟踪了她
<31-8,DARRELL>and--and I-I admit that I followed her.

911
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,160
<31-9,CASTLE>为什么
<31-9,CASTLE>Why?

912
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,980
<31-10,DARRELL>因为我以为她发现了大脚怪
<31-10,DARRELL>Because I think she found bigfoot.

913
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,350
<31-11,BECKETT>或许是她发现了一个蠢货装扮成大脚怪
<31-11,BECKETT>Or maybe she just found an idiot dressed up as bigfoot

914
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,610
<31-11,BECKETT>然后把她杀了
<31-11,BECKETT>who then killed her.

915
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,690
<31-12,DARRELL>不  我没有伤害安
<31-12,DARRELL>No! I didn't hurt Anne!

916
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,460
<31-13,BECKETT>好吧  那你只是跟踪了她
<31-13,BECKETT>Oh, okay. So you just stalked her?

917
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,910
<31-14,DARRELL>我只是...
<31-14,DARRELL>Look, I just...

918
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,240
<31-14,DARRELL>我只是想  就这一次
<31-14,DARRELL>I just wanted, just this once,

919
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,020
<31-14,DARRELL>看看这传说中的野兽
<31-14,DARRELL>to lay eyes on this elusive beast.

920
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,780
<31-14,DARRELL>所以我设了这个陷阱
<31-14,DARRELL>A-and that's why I built this man-trap

921
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,300
<31-14,DARRELL>穿上了这散发麝香的衣服
<31-14,DARRELL>and--and--and I'm in this suit, drenched in deer musk.

922
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,420
<31-15,CASTLE>我就说有怪味嘛
<31-15,CASTLE>Is that what that smell is?

923
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,230
<31-16,DARRELL>这是引诱剂  引他们出来
<31-16,DARRELL>It's an attractant. It--it lures them out.

924
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,270
<31-16,DARRELL>很有效
<31-16,DARRELL>A-and it's working, too.

925
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,150
<31-16,DARRELL>一小时之前  我听到
<31-16,DARRELL>I mean, a-about an hour ago, I-I heard--

926
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,990
<31-16,DARRELL>我听到叫声和敲木头的声音
<31-16,DARRELL>I heard vocalizations and--and knocking on wood.

927
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,260
<31-16,DARRELL>那些是经典的大脚怪交配鸣叫
<31-16,DARRELL>And--and those are--are classic bigfoot mating calls.

928
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,990
<31-17,DARRELL>我还发现了些吃剩的食物和粪便
<31-17,DARRELL>I also found some, uh, half-eaten food and some scat.

929
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,850
<31-17,DARRELL>更不用说  大脚怪用来
<31-17,DARRELL>And not to mention, a tool

930
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,780
<31-17,DARRELL>重击猎物的工具
<31-17,DARRELL>that bigfoot used to club his prey.

931
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,420
<31-17,DARRELL>上面还有血迹
<31-17,DARRELL>And there's blood on it.

932
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,470
<31-18,BECKETT>等等  你看见了一只有血迹的棍棒
<31-18,BECKETT>Wait a minute. You saw a bloody club?

933
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,880
<31-19,DARRELL>是啊
<31-19,DARRELL>Yeah.

934
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,750
<31-20,BECKETT>带我们去你发现的地点
<31-20,BECKETT>Show us where you found it.

935
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,140
<32-1,BECKETT>你认识这个吗
<32-1,BECKETT>Do you recognize this?

936
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,560
<32-1,BECKETT>上面是安·卡蒂诺的血迹
<32-1,BECKETT>That's Anne Cardinal's blood.

937
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,190
<32-1,BECKETT>我们在检测你的衣服
<32-1,BECKETT>We're checking your clothes for it, too,

938
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,900
<32-1,BECKETT>还有上面的污迹  一定会证明你去过树林
<32-1,BECKETT>along with the dirt that is gonna place you in the woods.

939
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,990
<32-2,KURT WILSON>你们就跟其他那些警察一样
<32-2,KURT WILSON>You're just like those other cops.

940
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,870
<32-2,KURT WILSON>你们宁愿主观臆断也不去查真相
<32-2,KURT WILSON>You'd rather make your case than see the truth.

941
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,490
<32-3,CASTLE>真相是什么  科特
<32-3,CASTLE>And what is the truth, Kurt?

942
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,600
<32-4,KURT>我是住在那树林里
<32-4,KURT>I was living out in those woods,

943
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,350
<32-4,KURT>但是安并不是来捕猎我的
<32-4,KURT>but Anne wasn't trying to hunt me down.

944
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,560
<32-4,KURT>她是来帮助我
<32-4,KURT>She came out there to help me,

945
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,970
<32-4,KURT>给我带食物和日常用品
<32-4,KURT>bring me food and supplies.

946
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,040
<32-5,BECKETT>安为什么要帮助一个杀害了她室友的人
<32-5,BECKETT>Why would Anne help the man that murdered her roommate?

947
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,220
<32-5,BECKETT>几个月前
<32-5,BECKETT>A few months ago,

948
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,480
<32-6,KURT>我从藏身处跑出来找到安
<32-6,KURT>I came out of hiding to find Anne.

949
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,590
<32-6,KURT>我告诉她我是无辜的  我没有杀贾丝婷
<32-6,KURT>I told her I was innocent, that I didn't kill Justine,

950
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,760
<32-6,KURT>我求她去查查这案子
<32-6,KURT>and I begged her to look into the case.

951
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,740
<32-6,KURT>她答应了  因为她相信我
<32-6,KURT>And she agreed to because she believed me.

952
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,480
<32-7,BECKETT>好吧  我有点更怀疑了
<32-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I'm a little more skeptical.

953
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,750
<32-8,CASTLE>这我可以担保
<32-8,CASTLE>I can vouch for that.

954
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,610
<32-9,BECKETT>你有暴力史  科特
<32-9,BECKETT>You have a history of violence, Kurt.

955
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,090
<32-9,BECKETT>很显然贾丝婷辍学
<32-9,BECKETT>And it's pretty clear that Justine dropped out

956
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,170
<32-9,BECKETT>想跟你分手  所以你杀了她
<32-9,BECKETT>and tried to break up with you, so you killed her.

957
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,710
<32-10,KURT>贾丝婷辍学不是为了摆脱我
<32-10,KURT>Justine did not drop out to get away from me.

958
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,680
<32-10,KURT>我们爱着对方
<32-10,KURT>She and I were in love.

959
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,900
<32-10,KURT>当她告诉我她要离开哈德逊大学
<32-10,KURT>When she told me she was quitting Hudson,

960
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,730
<32-10,KURT>我也决定一起走
<32-10,KURT>I decided to go, too.

961
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,290
<32-10,KURT>我们俩计划转到别的学校
<32-10,KURT>The two of us were planning on transferring to another school.

962
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,880
<32-10,KURT>她死前一周  我们甚至
<32-10,KURT>We'd even toured the campus

963
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,050
<32-10,KURT>还去了宾汉姆顿的纽约州大学参观
<32-10,KURT>at S.U.N.Y. Binghamton the week before.

964
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,070
<32-10,KURT>我确定他们留有记录
<32-10,KURT>And I'm sure they have a record of that somewhere.

965
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,810
<32-11,CASTLE>如果你不是贾丝婷离开哈德逊大学的原因
<32-11,CASTLE>If you weren't the reason why Justine left Hudson,

966
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,980
<32-11,CASTLE>那原因是什么
<32-11,CASTLE>then what was?

967
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,520
<32-12,KURT>她从没告诉我
<32-12,KURT>She never told me.

968
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,270
<32-12,KURT>她只说事情进展不顺利
<32-12,KURT>She just said that things weren't working out.

969
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,440
<32-12,KURT>但现在我花了很多时间
<32-12,KURT>But now I've spent a lot of time

970
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,350
<32-12,KURT>思考过这件事
<32-12,KURT>thinking about that,

971
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,100
<32-12,KURT>唯一说得通的理由
<32-12,KURT>and the only thing that makes sense

972
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,990
<32-12,KURT>就是有一个她害怕的人存在
<32-12,KURT>is if there was someone there that she was afraid of.

973
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,740
<32-13,CASTLE>比如谁
<32-13,CASTLE>Like who?

974
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,270
<32-14,KURT>同学  教授  我不知道
<32-14,KURT>A classmate, a professor-- I don't know.

975
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,190
<32-14,KURT>但我想安查出了真相
<32-14,KURT>But I think Anne found out.

976
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,680
<32-14,KURT>上周我去她工作的地方见她
<32-14,KURT>Last week when I came to see her at her work,

977
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,710
<32-14,KURT>她说她就快有答案了
<32-14,KURT>she said that she was close to having answers.

978
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,470
<32-14,KURT>接着我就得知她死了
<32-14,KURT>And the next thing I know, she's dead.

979
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,440
<32-14,KURT>所以我想无论是谁干的  也是杀贾丝婷的凶手
<32-14,KURT>So I figure whoever did it killed Justine, too.

980
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,290
<32-14,KURT>所以我才闯入她的公寓
<32-14,KURT>And that--that's why I broke into her apartment.

981
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,700
<32-14,KURT>我在找...  我也不知道
<32-14,KURT>I was looking for... I don't know,

982
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,020
<32-14,KURT>线索也好  答案也罢
<32-14,KURT>Clues, answers, a-anything.

983
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,920
<32-15,BECKETT>你认为杀害了安和贾丝婷的人
<32-15,BECKETT>The person that you think killed Anne and Justine--

984
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,470
<32-15,BECKETT>你想得出是谁吗
<32-15,BECKETT>Do you have any idea who it is?

985
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,950
<32-16,KURT>一定得是
<32-16,KURT>It had to be someone

986
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,270
<32-16,KURT>能说服贾丝婷开门的人
<32-16,KURT>who could talk Justine into opening her door.

987
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,540
<32-16,KURT>是她认识的人
<32-16,KURT>You know, someone she knew.

988
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,990
<32-16,KURT>所以他们才会想要偷她的项链
<32-16,KURT>It's the only reason that they would steal her necklace.

989
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,610
<32-16,KURT>那根本不值钱
<32-16,KURT>It wasn't worth anything.

990
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,060
<32-17,CASTLE>你不会是指一个青石坠子吧
<32-17,CASTLE>You wouldn't be referring to a lapis pendant, would you?

991
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,110
<32-18,KURT>贾丝婷从没摘下来过
<32-18,KURT>Justine never took it off.

992
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,780
<32-18,KURT>而我发现她时  那坠子不见了
<32-18,KURT>When I found her, that pendant was gone.

993
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,100
<32-18,KURT>拿走它的人  杀害了她
<32-18,KURT>Whoever took it killed her.

994
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,640
<32-19,BECKETT>科特
<32-19,BECKETT>Kurt...

995
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,970
<32-19,BECKETT>这是贾丝婷的坠子吗
<32-19,BECKETT>Is this Justine's pendant?

996
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,380
<32-20,BECKETT>所以安才吞了它
<32-20,BECKETT>That's why Anne had it.

997
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,590
<32-21,CASTLE>这坠子是证据  她找到了真正的凶手
<32-21,CASTLE>The pendant is proof. She found the real killer.

998
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,500
<32-21,CASTLE>凶手最近跟她接触过
<32-21,CASTLE>It has to be someone she spent time with recently.

999
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,270
<32-21,CASTLE>一个走进她生活的人
<32-21,CASTLE>Someone she got close to.

1000
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,250
<33-1,BECKETT>戴文教授
<33-1,BECKETT>Professor Devlin.

1001
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,390
<33-2,PAUL DEVLIN>有什么需要我帮忙的吗  探长
<33-2,PAUL DEVLIN>Can I help you, detective?

1002
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,330
<33-3,BECKETT>事实上  还真有
<33-3,BECKETT>As a matter of fact, you can.

1003
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,270
<33-3,BECKETT>关于贾丝婷·伯顿你知道些什么
<33-3,BECKETT>What can you tell us about Justine Bolton?

1004
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,220
<33-4,PAUL>她是哈德逊大学的学生
<33-4,PAUL>Uh, she was a student at Hudson

1005
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,530
<33-4,PAUL>不幸去世了
<33-4,PAUL>who died rather tragically.

1006
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,610
<33-5,CASTLE>你知道的不止这一点吧
<33-5,CASTLE>Well, you knew her as more than that.

1007
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,980
<33-5,CASTLE>她在大一的时候选修过
<33-5,CASTLE>She took your introduction to anthropology course

1008
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,010
<33-5,CASTLE>你的人类学概论课
<33-5,CASTLE>her freshman year.

1009
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,830
<33-6,PAUL>的确  所以对于她的离世我感到很悲痛
<33-6,PAUL>Yes, she did, which made her loss a personal one.

1010
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,340
<33-6,PAUL>但是我不知道
<33-6,PAUL>But I fail to see what that--

1011
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,900
<33-7,BECKETT>你知道在她上完课后
<33-7,BECKETT>Were you aware that after she took that course,

1012
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,870
<33-7,BECKETT>她告诉辅导员说她很害怕吗
<33-7,BECKETT>she told her counselor that she was afraid

1013
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,510
<33-7,BECKETT>因为学校里的某个人
<33-7,BECKETT>because someone on campus--

1014
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,380
<33-7,BECKETT>她没说是谁
<33-7,BECKETT>she never said who...

1015
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,350
<33-7,BECKETT>不过那个人对她很痴迷
<33-7,BECKETT>but someone was obsessed with her?

1016
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,240
<33-8,PAUL>她肯定是说她男朋友吧
<33-8,PAUL>Well, no doubt she was talking about her boyfriend--

1017
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,740
<33-8,PAUL>那个杀害她的人
<33-8,PAUL>the young man who killed her.

1018
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,030
<33-9,CASTLE>但她见辅导员的时候
<33-9,CASTLE>Ah, but she took the meeting with her counselor

1019
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,150
<33-9,CASTLE>还不认识她男朋友
<33-9,CASTLE>before she met her boyfriend.

1020
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,480
<33-10,BECKETT>却认识你
<33-10,BECKETT>But she had met you.

1021
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,760
<33-10,BECKETT>你的执教生涯很离奇啊  教授
<33-10,BECKETT>You've had an odd career, professor.

1022
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,980
<33-10,BECKETT>六年之内辗转四所学校当老师
<33-10,BECKETT>You taught at four schools in six years.

1023
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,740
<33-10,BECKETT>所以我打听了一下  他们都明里暗里地说到
<33-10,BECKETT>So I made a few inquiries, and there were intimations

1024
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,480
<33-10,BECKETT>你有跟踪和性骚扰的行为
<33-10,BECKETT>of stalking, sexual harassment,

1025
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,310
<33-10,BECKETT>还有更过分的举动
<33-10,BECKETT>and even worse.

1026
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,740
<33-11,PAUL>这些都是谣传
<33-11,PAUL>All of which were false.

1027
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,720
<33-11,PAUL>请允许我说明
<33-11,PAUL>And let me point out,

1028
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,080
<33-11,PAUL>我从来没有被投诉过
<33-11,PAUL>no action was ever taken against me.

1029
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,450
<33-12,BECKETT>贾丝婷在被杀害的那天
<33-12,BECKETT>Justine had scheduled a meeting with the dean

1030
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,000
<33-12,BECKETT>本来安排了和系主任的面谈
<33-12,BECKETT>on the day that she was killed

1031
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,150
<33-12,BECKETT>解释她为什么要退学
<33-12,BECKETT>to explain why she was leaving.

1032
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,140
<33-13,CASTLE>你不能让她和系主任见面
<33-13,CASTLE>You couldn't let her take that meeting.

1033
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,960
<33-13,CASTLE>因为如果她去了
<33-13,CASTLE>If she did...

1034
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,860
<33-13,CASTLE>你那些肮脏的过往就要被揭发了
<33-13,CASTLE>your dirty history would be exposed.

1035
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,470
<33-13,CASTLE>你就完蛋了
<33-13,CASTLE>You'd be finished.

1036
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,010
<33-13,CASTLE>所以你杀了她
<33-13,CASTLE>So you killed her.

1037
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,920
<33-13,CASTLE>作为"掠食者"
<33-13,CASTLE>And being the predator that you are,

1038
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,470
<33-13,CASTLE>你把她的吊坠拿走当做纪念品
<33-13,CASTLE>you took a souvenir-- her pendant.

1039
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,920
<33-14,BECKETT>当大家都认为科特·威尔森是嫌疑犯的时候
<33-14,BECKETT>With all the suspicion on Kurt Wilson,

1040
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,630
<33-14,BECKETT>没人在关注你
<33-14,BECKETT>no one was looking at you.

1041
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,590
<33-14,BECKETT>直到安的出现
<33-14,BECKETT>Until Anne came along.

1042
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,550
<33-15,PAUL>我不知道你们在说什么
<33-15,PAUL>I don't know what you're talking about.

1043
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,460
<33-16,BECKETT>安发现了那个吊坠
<33-16,BECKETT>Anne found that pendant.

1044
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,180
<33-16,BECKETT>她知道凶手是你
<33-16,BECKETT>She knew it was you.

1045
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,280
<33-16,BECKETT>当她走进森林的时候  你跟踪了她
<33-16,BECKETT>And when she went into the woods, you followed her.

1046
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,520
<33-17,PAUL>什么森林  我没去过森林
<33-17,PAUL>What woods? I wasn't in any woods.

1047
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,590
<33-18,BECKETT>我们查过你的通话记录
<33-18,BECKETT>We checked your phone records.

1048
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,170
<33-18,BECKETT>当安被袭击的时候
<33-18,BECKETT>Your cell pinged the same tower as Anne's did

1049
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,580
<33-18,BECKETT>你和她的手机信号都来自一个信号塔
<33-18,BECKETT>around the time that she was attacked.

1050
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,580
<33-18,BECKETT>这证明了你在案发现场
<33-18,BECKETT>That places you at the crime scene.

1051
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,230
<33-18,BECKETT>我们也找到了一根带有安血液的棍子
<33-18,BECKETT>We also found a club with Anne's blood on it

1052
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,890
<33-18,BECKETT>那上面还有另外一个人的DNA
<33-18,BECKETT>and someone else's D.N.A.

1053
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,910
<33-18,BECKETT>根据你现在看我的表情
<33-18,BECKETT>And based on the look that you're giving me right now,

1054
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,240
<33-18,BECKETT>我十分肯定那就是你的DNA
<33-18,BECKETT>I'm pretty damn sure it's yours.

1055
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,860
<34-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<34-1,BECKETT>So, Castle,

1056
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,150
<34-1,BECKETT>大脚怪并不存在  你失望吗
<34-1,BECKETT>are you disappointed that there's no bigfoot after all?

1057
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,200
<34-2,CASTLE>我不确定它真的不存在
<34-2,CASTLE>Well, I'm not so sure there isn't.

1058
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,790
<34-2,CASTLE>我觉得也许他就在某个地方
<34-2,CASTLE>I'm thinking maybe he's out there somewhere,

1059
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,150
<34-2,CASTLE>如果是这样的话  希望我能见一见他
<34-2,CASTLE>and if he is, I hope to see him one day.

1060
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,900
<34-2,CASTLE>当然最好是远远的看
<34-2,CASTLE>Preferably from a safe distance.

1061
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,420
<34-3,KURT>谢谢你们  完成安未完成的事
<34-3,KURT>Thank you... for finishing what Anne started.

1062
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,190
<34-3,KURT>因为你们的努力
<34-3,KURT>Because of you guys,

1063
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,030
<34-3,KURT>杀害贾丝婷的凶手不再逍遥法外
<34-3,KURT>Justine's killer will pay for what he did to her,

1064
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,180
<34-3,KURT>我也洗刷了罪名
<34-3,KURT>and, uh, I'm a free man.

1065
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,870
<34-4,CASTLE>那你接下来想干什么
<34-4,CASTLE>So what's next for you?

1066
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,770
<34-5,KURT>我要继续做安的研究
<34-5,KURT>I'm going to continue Anne's work.

1067
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,480
<34-6,CASTLE>你要调查大脚怪  为什么啊
<34-6,CASTLE>You're gonna research bigfoot, why?

1068
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,060
<34-7,KURT>当她建议我躲在森林里的时候
<34-7,KURT>Well, when she suggested I hide out in those woods,

1069
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,110
<34-7,KURT>她说我会有伴儿的
<34-7,KURT>she told me I'd have company out there.

1070
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,710
<34-7,KURT>她说得没错
<34-7,KURT>She was right.

1071
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,350
<34-8,CASTLE>你听到了没
<34-8,CASTLE>Did you hear that?

1072
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,750
<34-8,CASTLE>我要去拿我的装备了
<34-8,CASTLE>I gotta go and get my outfit.

1073
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,350
<34-8,CASTLE>嗨
<34-8,CASTLE>Hey.

1074
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,980
<35-1,CASTLE>你的...还有点...
<35-1,CASTLE>You, um... you still got a little... on your...

1075
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,750
<35-1,CASTLE>真的很抱歉
<35-1,CASTLE>I'm--I'm so sorry about that.

1076
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,290
<35-2,ALEXIS>你知道那有多丢人啊
<35-2,ALEXIS>Do you know how humiliating that was?

1077
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,160
<35-3,CASTLE>我发誓  我真的不知道是你
<35-3,CASTLE>I swear, I had no idea it was you.

1078
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,990
<35-3,CASTLE>不过  阿丽克西斯  你为什么要偷食物
<35-3,CASTLE>But, Alexis, why were you stealing food?

1079
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,000
<35-4,ALEXIS>因为我没钱了
<35-4,ALEXIS>Because I ran out of money.

1080
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,790
<35-5,CASTLE>你怎么会把钱都花光呢  除非
<35-5,CASTLE>How could you have possibly spent all your money unless--

1081
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,520
<35-5,CASTLE>等一下  不会吧  你是不是
<35-5,CASTLE>Wait. No. Are you...

1082
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,760
<35-5,CASTLE>你是不是有什么麻烦
<35-5,CASTLE>Are--are you in some kind of trouble?

1083
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,170
<35-6,ALEXIS>我没把钱花光  我只是捐出去了
<35-6,ALEXIS>No, I didn't spend it. I gave it away.

1084
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,030
<35-6,ALEXIS>是投资  真的
<35-6,ALEXIS>Invested it, really.

1085
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,210
<35-7,CASTLE>投资什么
<35-7,CASTLE>Invested in what?

1086
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,050
<35-8,ALEXIS>我朋友乔纳举办了一场集资活动
<35-8,ALEXIS>My friend Jonah at school has a crowdfunding campaign

1087
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,160
<35-8,ALEXIS>他准备在摩天大楼的屋顶上种竹子
<35-8,ALEXIS>to plant bamboo forests on the roof of skyscrapers

1088
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,860
<35-8,ALEXIS>这可以净化空气
<35-8,ALEXIS>to help clean the air.

1089
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,280
<35-9,CASTLE>你为什么不直接告诉我呢
<35-9,CASTLE>Well, why didn't you just come to me?

1090
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,020
<35-10,ALEXIS>因为我不想听你的老生常谈了
<35-10,ALEXIS>Because I didn't want the speech.

1091
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,930
<35-11,CASTLE>我没有  什么老生常谈
<35-11,CASTLE>I don't--what speech?

1092
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,740
<35-12,ALEXIS>我们这种有钱人
<35-12,ALEXIS>That people like us need to be careful

1093
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,150
<35-12,ALEXIS>应该小心谨慎
<35-12,ALEXIS>with the kind of money we have.

1094
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,400
<35-12,ALEXIS>别人可能会占我们的便宜
<35-12,ALEXIS>People might try to take advantage.

1095
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,560
<35-13,CASTLE>这个啊
<35-13,CASTLE>Oh, that speech. Yeah.

1096
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,510
<35-14,ALEXIS>爸爸  你相信那些不可思议的事情
<35-14,ALEXIS>Dad, you believe in all these unbelievable things,

1097
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,260
<35-14,ALEXIS>比如说大脚怪  我从来没有说过什么
<35-14,ALEXIS>like bigfoot, and I don't judge.

1098
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,510
<35-14,ALEXIS>但是  我相信人和他们能做到的事情
<35-14,ALEXIS>But... I believe in people and what they can accomplish.

1099
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,170
<35-14,ALEXIS>我相信乔纳和他的远见
<35-14,ALEXIS>I believe in Jonah and his vision,

1100
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,580
<35-14,ALEXIS>我想支持他
<35-14,ALEXIS>and I wanted to support him.

1101
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,370
<35-14,ALEXIS>我认为他能改变世界
<35-14,ALEXIS>I think he could make a real difference in the world.

1102
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,090
<35-14,ALEXIS>好吧  也许把我所有的零花钱都给他
<35-14,ALEXIS>And, okay, so maybe it was stupid

1103
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,740
<35-14,ALEXIS>是一件很蠢的事
<35-14,ALEXIS>to give him all of my allowance,

1104
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,020
<35-14,ALEXIS>但我可不是第一个为了坚信的事
<35-14,ALEXIS>But I am not the first person to do something stupid

1105
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,310
<35-14,ALEXIS>去做蠢事的人
<35-14,ALEXIS>for something they believe in.

1106
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,320
<35-14,ALEXIS>对对  你不是第一个
<35-14,ALEXIS>No. No, you're not.

1107
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,240
<35-15,CASTLE>事实上  我们的家风就是如此
<35-15,CASTLE>Matter of fact, it's a... bit of a family trait.

1108
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,940
<35-15,CASTLE>但是  你还是欠我
<35-15,CASTLE>But... you do owe me

1109
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,250
<35-15,CASTLE>一顿烤牛排
<35-15,CASTLE>a chateaubriand.

1110
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,850
<35-15,CASTLE>咱们去马戏团餐厅吧
<35-15,CASTLE>So... let's go to Le Cirque.

1111
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:55,270
<35-15,CASTLE>然后  叫乔纳这小子和我们一起吧
<35-15,CASTLE>And then, uh, call this Jonah guy, have him meet us.

1112
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,590
<35-15,CASTLE>我想听听他要怎么改变世界
<35-15,CASTLE>I'd like to hear about how he's gonna change the world.

1113
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,850
<35-16,ALEXIS>真的吗
<35-16,ALEXIS>Really?

1114
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,740
<35-17,CASTLE>我也相信人
<35-17,CASTLE>I believe in people, too.

1115
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,810
<35-18,ALEXIS>和借钱的人
<35-18,ALEXIS>And borrowers.

1116
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,280
<35-19,CASTLE>还有大脚怪
<35-19,CASTLE>And bigfoot.
