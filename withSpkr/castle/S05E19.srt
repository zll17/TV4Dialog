00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,940
<1-1,JOHN DESSENS>你吃了我的薯条吗
<1-1,JOHN DESSENS>Did you eat my fries?

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,360
<1-2,SELENA RIGAS>你不该就那么放着
<1-2,SELENA RIGAS>You shouldn't have left them.

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,120
<1-3,RIGAS>那是什么
<1-3,RIGAS>What is that?

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,140
<1-4,DESSENS>不知道
<1-4,DESSENS>I have no idea.

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,350
<1-4,DESSENS>快报警
<1-4,DESSENS>Call 9-1-1!

00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,760
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>两周就好了
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>Just another two weeks.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,010
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>已经两周了
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>It's already been two weeks.

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,230
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>两周永远到不了头
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Two weeks is an eternity.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,000
<2-3,BECKETT>也许我们下次去滑雪
<2-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, maybe next time we go skiing,

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,620
<2-3,BECKETT>你就别卖弄了
<2-3,BECKETT>you're not gonna be such a show-off.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,360
<2-4,CASTLE>我没有卖弄
<2-4,CASTLE>I wasn't showing off.

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,290
<2-4,CASTLE>好吧  我是卖弄了一点点
<2-4,CASTLE>Okay, I was showing off a little bit.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,280
<2-4,CASTLE>我跟你发誓
<2-4,CASTLE>But I swear to you,

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,560
<2-4,CASTLE>我闭着眼就能玩后手抓尾板
<2-4,CASTLE>I can do a tail grab with my eyes closed

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,100
<2-4,CASTLE>而不会摔断膝盖
<2-4,CASTLE>and without breaking my kneecap.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,540
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>我走了
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>Well, I am off.

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,120
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>静修的地方没有手机信号
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>Now the retreat is out of cell phone range,

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,580
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>如果你生日当天我没打电话
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>so if I don't call you on your birthday,

28
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,710
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>并不是因为我忘记了
<2-6,MARTHA RODGERS>it is not because I have forgotten.

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,580
<2-7,CASTLE>我不会认为你是忘记了
<2-7,CASTLE>I won't think it's because you've forgotten.

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,520
<2-7,CASTLE>我会认为你有其它的安排
<2-7,CASTLE>I'll think it's because you made other plans.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
<2-8,MARTHA>等等
<2-8,MARTHA>Now wait a minute.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,900
<2-8,MARTHA>你和凯瑟琳这周本该去
<2-8,MARTHA>You and Katherine were supposed to be

<2-9,CASTLE>静修开心些
<2-9,CASTLE>Have a great time on your retreat...

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,420
<2-9,CASTLE>别管你独生儿子的生日了
<2-9,CASTLE>On your only son's birthday.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,460
<2-10,MARTHA>这是水疗之旅  亲爱的  可不是内疚之旅
<2-10,MARTHA>It is a spa trip, darling. Not a guilt trip.

38
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,700
<2-10,MARTHA>他是你的了

<2-12,BECKETT>你生日时我带你去个好地方
<2-12,BECKETT>and I'll take you somewhere nice for your birthday.

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,660
<2-13,CASTLE>有博拉博拉岛那么好吗
<2-13,CASTLE>As nice as bora bora?

<2-15,MARTHA>凯瑟琳  你的司机来了
<2-15,MARTHA>Katherine, your ride is here.

47
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,380
<2-16,BECKETT>太好了
<2-16,BECKETT>Oh, great.

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,220
<2-18,BECKETT>-司机  -对  发现了尸体
<2-18,BECKETT>- Ride? - Yeah, we had a body drop.

49
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,240
<2-18,BECKETT>我叫他们来接我
<2-18,BECKETT>I asked the boys to pick me up

50
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,830
<2-18,BECKETT>这样我有时间给你做早餐
<2-18,BECKETT>so I'd have enough time to make you breakfast.

51
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,370
<2-19,CASTLE>我又错过了一件案子  不  别这样
<2-19,CASTLE>I'm missing another case? No. Come on.

52
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,930
<2-19,CASTLE>伙计们  带上我吧
<2-19,CASTLE>Guys, take me with you.

53
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,680
<2-20,BECKETT>不  你好转前不行
<2-20,BECKETT>No! Not until you get better.

54
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,500
<2-21,KEVIN RYAN>卡塞尔  膝盖怎么样
<2-21,KEVIN RYAN>Castle, how's the knee?

55
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,710
<2-22,CASTLE>膝盖没什么  我快闷死了
<2-22,CASTLE>It's not the knee so much as the boredom.

56
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,060
<2-23,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我以为你们作家喜欢独处
<2-23,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I thought you writers liked being alone.

57
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,010
<2-24,CASTLE>如果我能写的话
<2-24,CASTLE>Yeah, if I could write.

58
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,170
<2-24,CASTLE>但是止痛药让我有些糊涂
<2-24,CASTLE>But the painkillers make me a little loopy.

59
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,160
<2-24,CASTLE>昨晚我在一句话中
<2-24,CASTLE>Last night I used the word "Speculate"

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,540
<2-24,CASTLE>用了三次"推测"这个词
<2-24,CASTLE>three times in the same sentence.

61
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,380
<2-25,RYAN>你肯定很无聊
<2-25,RYAN>You must be bored.

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,170
<2-25,RYAN>你都玩起《后窗》了
<2-25,RYAN>You've actually gone "Rear window."

64
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,420
<2-26,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯给我的  想让我开心起来
<2-26,CASTLE>Alexis got me those as a joke to cheer me up.

65
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,900
<2-26,CASTLE>我还没有沦落为偷窥狂
<2-26,CASTLE>I have not yet resorted to voyeurism.

66
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,870
<2-27,RYAN>那是你的遗憾了
<2-27,RYAN>Then you are missing out.

67
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,770
<2-28,ESPOSITO>什么  让我看看  给我
<2-28,ESPOSITO>What? Let me see. No, hey--give me.

68
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,170
<2-31,RYAN>哥们  她刚准备取下浴巾
<2-31,RYAN>Dude, she was just about to take off her towel.

69
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,370
<2-32,ESPOSITO>-浴巾取下了  -真的吗
<2-32,ESPOSITO>- Oh, the towel is off. - Really?

70
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,140
<2-33,RYAN>是的
<2-33,RYAN>Yeah.

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,780
<2-34,BECKETT>除非你们看的是具死尸
<2-34,BECKETT>Unless the body that you're looking at is dead,

72
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,020
<2-34,BECKETT>我建议你们放下望远镜
<2-34,BECKETT>I suggest you drop those binoculars.

73
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,340
<2-34,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<2-34,BECKETT>Okay, Castle.

74
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,760
<2-34,BECKETT>我会尽快打电话查看你的情况
<2-34,BECKETT>I will call you and check on you soon.

75
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,420
<2-35,CASTLE>我通过电话做顾问怎么样
<2-35,CASTLE>Hey, what if I consult by phone?

76
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,450
<2-35,CASTLE>可以假装我是查理  你们是我的霹雳娇娃
<2-35,CASTLE>We could pretend I'm Charlie, and you're my angels.

77
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,780
<3-1,BECKETT>为什么男人生病或受伤时
<3-1,BECKETT>Why are men such babies

78
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,700
<3-1,BECKETT>就变得这么孩子气
<3-1,BECKETT>when they get sick or injured?

79
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,840
<3-2,ESPOSITO>这跟进化有关
<3-2,ESPOSITO>It's an evolutionary thing.

80
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,530
<3-2,ESPOSITO>这样男人可以让女人照顾他们
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Men who can get women to take care of 'em,

81
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,340
<3-2,ESPOSITO>这样生存的机会比较大
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Well, they have a greater chance of survival.

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,300
<3-3,BECKETT>不是吧  埃斯波  你在哪里看到的
<3-3,BECKETT>Really, Espo? Where'd you read that,

83
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,390
<3-3,BECKETT>"你自己瞎编"杂志吗
<3-3,BECKETT>"You're making it up" magazine?

84
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,360
<3-4,BECKETT>蕾妮  什么情况
<3-4,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie. So what have we got?

85
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,300
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>抱歉  亲爱的  情况很不好
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>Sorry, sweetie. It's a bad one.

86
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,970
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>头部多处挫伤
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>Multiple contusions to the head,

87
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,420
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>从头盖骨的破碎情况来看
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>evidence of fracturing at the base of the skull,

88
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,900
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>鉴于伤痕  我敢说
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>from the patterning, I'd say she was

89
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,280
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>是被那个球棒反复击打造成的
<3-5,LANIE PARISH>repeatedly struck by that bat.

90
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,790
<3-6,ESPOSITO>知道死者身份吗
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Do we know who she is?

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,730
<3-7,LANIE>发现她的保安确认她是克莱拉·德温特
<3-7,LANIE>The guard who found her IDed her as Clara Dewinter--

92
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,440
<3-7,LANIE>35岁  住在皇后区  已婚
<3-7,LANIE>35, lives in queens, and married.

93
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,420
<3-8,BECKETT>她大半夜的在这个小巷做什么
<3-8,BECKETT>What was she doing in this alleyway in the middle of the night?

94
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,840
<3-9,LANIE>她是国税局税务师
<3-9,LANIE>She was an I.R.S. Agent.

95
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,180
<3-9,LANIE>在这里上班
<3-9,LANIE>Worked in this building here.

96
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,720
<3-10,RYAN>显然她是加班了
<3-10,RYAN>Apparently, she was working late.

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,210
<3-10,RYAN>员工有时候穿过这条小巷
<3-10,RYAN>The employees sometimes cut across the alley

98
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,740
<3-10,RYAN>走到隔壁的停车场
<3-10,RYAN>to get to the parking garage next door.

99
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,590
<3-11,BECKETT>有目击证人吗
<3-11,BECKETT>Do we have a witness?

100
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,030
<3-12,RYAN>没有  但有比目击证人更好的东西
<3-12,RYAN>No, but we may have something way better.

101
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,850
<4-1,BECKETT>这是什么
<4-1,BECKETT>What the hell is that?

102
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,980
<4-1,BECKETT>不知道  女士
<4-1,BECKETT>No idea, ma'am.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,690
<4-2,RIGAS>从未见过这样的情况
<4-2,RIGAS>Never seen anything like it.

104
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,570
<4-3,BECKETT>埃斯波
<4-3,BECKETT>Espo?

105
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,390
<4-4,ESPOSITO>这是红外摄像头
<4-4,ESPOSITO>It's an infrared camera.

106
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,180
<4-4,ESPOSITO>凶手可以戴着
<4-4,ESPOSITO>So our attacker could be wearing

107
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,310
<4-4,ESPOSITO>高强度的红外光
<4-4,ESPOSITO>some sort of high-intensity I.R. Lights,

108
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,520
<4-4,ESPOSITO>肉眼看不到  但能屏蔽摄像
<4-4,ESPOSITO>which would be invisible to the eye but blinding to that camera.

109
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,370
<4-5,DESSENS>对于街头犯罪来说相当高级啊
<4-5,DESSENS>That's pretty sophisticated for a street criminal.

110
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,800
<4-6,BECKETT>不  这不是街头犯罪
<4-6,BECKETT>No, this wasn't a street crime.

111
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,770
<4-6,BECKETT>凶手知道摄像机在那里  采取了措施
<4-6,BECKETT>The person knew that that camera was there and took precautions.

112
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,240
<4-6,BECKETT>这是有计划的谋杀
<4-6,BECKETT>This was a premeditated murder.

113
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,400
<4-6,BECKETT>等等  倒回去
<4-6,BECKETT>Wait. Go back.

114
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,740
<4-7,BECKETT>就是这里
<4-7,BECKETT>Right there.

115
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,430
<4-7,BECKETT>这是凶手的车  好了
<4-7,BECKETT>That's our killer's car. All right.

116
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,580
<4-7,BECKETT>让技术人员分析图像查明车型
<4-7,BECKETT>Let's have tech filter that image for make and model

117
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,340
<4-7,BECKETT>看能不能看清楚凶手的脸
<4-7,BECKETT>and let's see if they can get us a better look at our attacker's face.

118
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,000
<5-1,GAVIN DEWINTER>因为裁员  她的工作量增加了
<5-1,GAVIN DEWINTER>With all the cutbacks, her workload increased.

119
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,140
<5-1,GAVIN DEWINTER>她一周会加几次班  赶上进度
<5-1,GAVIN DEWINTER>She'd stay late a couple of times a week trying to catch up,

120
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,540
<5-1,GAVIN DEWINTER>她加班时  我就在商店加班
<5-1,GAVIN DEWINTER>and on those nights, I'd pick up an extra shift at the store.

121
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,550
<5-2,BECKETT>你最后一次见到她是什么时候
<5-2,BECKETT>And when was the last time you saw her?

122
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,780
<5-3,GAVIN>我们大概七点吃的晚餐
<5-3,GAVIN>We had dinner around 7:00,

123
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,620
<5-3,GAVIN>然后
<5-3,GAVIN>Then, uh...

124
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,560
<5-3,GAVIN>我们就都回去工作了
<5-3,GAVIN>we both went back to work.

125
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,560
<5-4,BECKETT>她看起来如何  紧张不安吗
<5-4,BECKETT>And how did she seem? Was she nervous, upset?

126
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,420
<5-5,GAVIN>没有  看起来挺好的
<5-5,GAVIN>No. She was fine.

127
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,050
<5-6,BECKETT>你妻子在国税局是做什么工作的
<5-6,BECKETT>And what--what exactly did your wife do for the I.R.S.

128
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,490
<5-7,GAVIN>她是调查员
<5-7,GAVIN>Uh, she was an investigator.

129
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,980
<5-7,GAVIN>调查逃税的人
<5-7,GAVIN>She went after tax evaders.

130
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,510
<5-8,BECKETT>那她一定有很多仇人了
<5-8,BECKETT>So she must have made enemies.

131
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,860
<5-9,GAVIN>是啊  基本上她审计过的人都是
<5-9,GAVIN>Yeah, pretty much everyone she audited.

132
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,690
<5-10,BECKETT>有没有哪个人找过她麻烦
<5-10,BECKETT>And was there anyone in particular that she had trouble with?

133
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,530
<5-11,GAVIN>事实上  真有一个
<5-11,GAVIN>Actually... yeah.

134
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,120
<5-11,GAVIN>我们几星期前在外面吃饭
<5-11,GAVIN>We were out at--out at dinner a couple of weeks ago,

135
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,600
<5-11,GAVIN>就有一个男的冲进来
<5-11,GAVIN>a-and this guy comes barging into the restaurant

136
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,330
<5-11,GAVIN>说克莱拉毁了他
<5-11,GAVIN>accusing Clara of destroying his life.

137
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,710
<5-12,BECKETT>她有告诉过你他是谁吗
<5-12,BECKETT>Did she tell you who he was?

138
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,550
<5-13,GAVIN>就是一个她捉到逃税的人
<5-13,GAVIN>Just another tax cheat she took down.

139
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,540
<5-13,GAVIN>她说没什么关系
<5-13,GAVIN>She said it was no big deal,

140
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,460
<5-13,GAVIN>但我看得出来  她很紧张
<5-13,GAVIN>but I could tell, she was rattled.

141
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,560
<5-14,BECKETT>能跟我描述一下那个人吗
<5-14,BECKETT>Can you tell me what he looked like?

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,980
<5-15,GAVIN>一米八
<5-15,GAVIN>6 feet...

143
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,090
<5-15,GAVIN>黑头发
<5-15,GAVIN>dark hair.

144
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,520
<5-15,GAVIN>你该去她单位查查
<5-15,GAVIN>You should check with her work.

145
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,510
<5-15,GAVIN>她答应我会去投诉的  所以...
<5-15,GAVIN>She promised to file a complaint, so...

146
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,770
<6-1,CASTLE>看来今天晴空很晴朗啊
<6-1,CASTLE>Looks like we got some beautiful clear skies with us today.

147
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,750
<6-1,CASTLE>今天是顺风  我们很快就能到达  伙计们
<6-1,CASTLE>A nice tail wind's gonna get us there right away, folks.

149
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,920
<6-1,CASTLE>我们会在天黑前到达的
<6-1,CASTLE>We'll be there zero dark thirty, zero dark quarter to.

150
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,310
<6-1,CASTLE>很好  红五号  状况不错
<6-1,CASTLE>Nice, red five. You're looking good.

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,990
<6-1,CASTLE>不  我这儿出了点问题
<6-1,CASTLE>Oh, no. I've got something wrong.

152
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,180
<6-1,CASTLE>这可不妙
<6-1,CASTLE>Ooh, that's not good.

153
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,060
<6-2,CASTLE>躲避  躲避  躲避
<6-2,CASTLE>Evade! Evade! Evade!

154
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,000
<6-3,CASTLE>不
<6-3,CASTLE>No!

155
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,810
<6-4,CASTLE>有幸存者吗
<6-4,CASTLE>Survivors.

156
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,670
<6-4,CASTLE>大多数国税局调查员都受过威胁
<6-4,CASTLE>Look, most I.R.S. agents get threats.

157
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,010
<7-1,CHARLIE BLUNT>这活儿就这样
<7-1,CHARLIE BLUNT>It's the nature of our business.

158
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,030
<7-2,RYAN>德温特太太最近上报过吗
<7-2,RYAN>Did Mrs. Dewinter report any recently?

159
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,940
<7-3,BLUNT>没有
<7-3,BLUNT>No.

160
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,880
<7-4,ESPOSITO>你确定吗
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Are you sure?

161
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,820
<7-5,BLUNT>你要明白
<7-5,BLUNT>You have to understand,

162
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,670
<7-5,BLUNT>克莱拉这种人很少有
<7-5,BLUNT>Clara was a rare breed--

163
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,340
<7-5,BLUNT>她是真心喜欢这份工作
<7-5,BLUNT>an I.R.S. agent who actually liked her job.

164
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,830
<7-6,RYAN>这和她受到威胁有什么关系
<7-6,RYAN>What's that have to do with her being threatened?

165
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,850
<7-7,BLUNT>原因在于
<7-7,BLUNT>The thing is,

166
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,500
<7-7,BLUNT>每起投诉都要去调查
<7-7,BLUNT>each threat requires an investigation,

167
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,440
<7-7,BLUNT>这会让上面的人很头痛
<7-7,BLUNT>which is a headache for upstairs.

168
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,960
<7-7,BLUNT>投诉的调查员的业绩评估会受影响
<7-7,BLUNT>It's an unwritten rule that agents who report threats

169
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,360
<7-7,BLUNT>这是不成文的规矩了
<7-7,BLUNT>don't fare well on performance reviews.

170
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,230
<7-8,ESPOSITO>这个不成文的规矩很可能害死了她
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Well, that unwritten rule may have gotten her killed.

171
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,890
<7-9,RYAN>既然你没有她的投诉记录
<7-9,RYAN>And since you don't have a record of the threat,

172
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,770
<7-9,RYAN>那我们只好查她一年内的
<7-9,RYAN>we're gonna have to take a look at her audit files

173
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,130
<7-9,RYAN>审计文件了
<7-9,RYAN>going back at least a year.

174
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,080
<8-1,CASTLE>肯定是作家
<8-1,CASTLE>Must be writers.

175
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,670
<8-2,CASTLE>最好是孩子病了急需钱
<8-2,CASTLE>Oh, that better be for a sick child.

176
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,130
<8-3,CASTLE>真好啊  年轻
<8-3,CASTLE>Oh, to be young and...

177
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,630
<8-3,CASTLE>还没工作
<8-3,CASTLE>underemployed.

178
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
<8-4,CASTLE>稳住  慢点
<8-4,CASTLE>Whoa. Hold on, guys. Slow down.

179
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,660
<8-4,CASTLE>这可不是比赛
<8-4,CASTLE>Not a race.

180
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,970
<8-4,CASTLE>或者关上百叶窗啊
<8-4,CASTLE>Maybe close the blinds.

181
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,470
<8-4,CASTLE>好吧  好好玩吧
<8-4,CASTLE>All right, you kids. You have fun.

182
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,850
<8-5,CASTLE>有人提前回家了
<8-5,CASTLE>Someone's home early.

183
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,560
<8-5,CASTLE>有没有搞错
<8-5,CASTLE>Really?

184
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,200
<8-6,CASTLE>你这会儿还亲他
<8-6,CASTLE>You're gonna kiss him now?

185
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,300
<8-7,CASTLE>也许下次
<8-7,CASTLE>Oh, maybe next time,

186
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,770
<8-7,CASTLE>出轨前得三思而后行啊
<8-7,CASTLE>you'll think twice about being cheatin' cheaters.

187
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,540
<8-8,CASTLE>有人可要好好解释了
<8-8,CASTLE>Someone's got some 'splaining to do.

188
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,380
<9-1,BECKETT>伙计们
<9-1,BECKETT>Hey, guys.

189
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,480
<9-1,BECKETT>技术部没办法辨别出
<9-1,BECKETT>So... tech couldn't get us a better look

190
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,610
<9-1,BECKETT>袭击者的脸
<9-1,BECKETT>at the attacker's face,

191
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,260
<9-1,BECKETT>不过明早之前应该能查明车型
<9-1,BECKETT>but they're hoping to have an I.D. on the car by morning.

192
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,160
<9-1,BECKETT>你们查得怎么样了
<9-1,BECKETT>How's it going in here?

193
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,440
<9-2,RYAN>克莱拉的同事想不起来
<9-2,RYAN>Well, Clara's colleagues don't remember

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,460
<9-2,RYAN>她提过被威胁的事
<9-2,RYAN>her mentioning any explicit threat.

195
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,550
<9-3,ESPOSITO>但是如果想找人生被毁掉的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>But if we're looking for people whose lives were ruined,

196
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,910
<9-3,ESPOSITO>会有很多嫌疑人
<9-3,ESPOSITO>there's no shortage of suspects.

197
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,820
<9-3,ESPOSITO>有房产被收回的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>We've got houses that were repossessed,

198
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,840
<9-3,ESPOSITO>银行存款被扣押的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>bank accounts that were seized,

199
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,810
<9-3,ESPOSITO>公司倒闭的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>businesses that were shut down,

200
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,080
<9-3,ESPOSITO>这才看了两个月的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>and we're only a couple of months in.

201
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,590
<9-4,BECKETT>那就列个名单出来
<9-4,BECKETT>Okay, so let's put a list together

202
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,510
<9-4,BECKETT>找出他们的照片
<9-4,BECKETT>and pull photos...

203
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,150
<9-4,BECKETT>看看她老公能认出来谁
<9-4,BECKETT>see if the husband recognizes anyone.

204
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,150
<9-5,RYAN>好
<9-5,RYAN>Right.

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
<9-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<9-6,BECKETT>Hey, Castle.

206
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,560
<9-7,CASTLE>你在哪
<9-7,CASTLE>Where are you?

207
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,900
<9-8,BECKETT>在分局  怎么了
<9-8,BECKETT>I'm at work. Why?

208
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,010
<9-9,CASTLE>你说会带晚餐回来
<9-9,CASTLE>You said you were bringing home dinner.

209
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,850
<9-10,BECKETT>我回去时买啊
<9-10,BECKETT>Yes, on my way home.

210
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,820
<9-11,CASTLE>你什么时候出发
<9-11,CASTLE>So when are you leaving?

211
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,360
<9-12,BECKETT>快了
<9-12,BECKETT>Soon.

212
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,960
<9-12,BECKETT>快了是什么时候
<9-12,BECKETT>When's soon?

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,770
<9-14,BECKETT>大概  半小时
<9-14,BECKETT>Like in... half an hour.

214
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,010
<9-15,CASTLE>好吧
<9-15,CASTLE>Fine.

215
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,700
<9-16,BECKETT>闭嘴吧
<9-16,BECKETT>Shut up.

216
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,590
<10-1,CASTLE>他绝对发现了
<10-1,CASTLE>Ooh, he is so on to you.

217
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,800
<10-1,CASTLE>这就来了
<10-1,CASTLE>Here it comes--

218
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,380
<10-1,CASTLE>不可避免的分手
<10-1,CASTLE>the inevitable, huge breakup.

219
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,840
<10-2,CASTLE>别别别
<10-2,CASTLE>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

220
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,760
<10-2,CASTLE>千万别  别拿刀
<10-2,CASTLE>Don't, don't. Don't take the knife.

221
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,010
<10-2,CASTLE>别啊
<10-2,CASTLE>Don't...

222
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,440
<10-2,CASTLE>不
<10-2,CASTLE>No. Uh...

223
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,670
<11-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你催我也没用...
<11-1,BECKETT>Castle, I'm not gonna get there any faster--

224
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,140
<11-1,BECKETT>不是  不是  贝克特  听我说
<11-1,BECKETT>Oh, no, no, no, no, Beckett, Beckett, listen...

225
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,270
<11-2,CASTLE>我好像目睹了一桩凶案
<11-2,CASTLE>I think I just saw a murder.

226
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,670
<11-2,CASTLE>2009.3.9-2013.4.1 4 years 48 months 212 weeks 1484days 100 episodes.
<11-2,CASTLE>Always be with you!!!

236
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,890
<11-2,CASTLE>他们怎么不逮捕他啊
<11-2,CASTLE>Why aren't they arresting him?

237
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,640
<11-2,CASTLE>我知道我看到了什么
<11-2,CASTLE>Look, I know what I saw.

238
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,850
<13-1,CASTLE>他拿了一把刀  跟着她进了卧室
<13-1,CASTLE>He took a knife and followed her into the bedroom.

239
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,940
<13-2,RYAN>我看过卧室了
<13-2,RYAN>I looked in the bedroom.

240
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,230
<13-2,RYAN>一切正常  我发誓  没有血没有尸体
<13-2,RYAN>Everything was fine. No blood, no body, I swear.

241
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,420
<13-3,CASTLE>你看过床底下吗  衣柜里呢
<13-3,CASTLE>Did you look under the bed, in the closet?

242
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,230
<13-4,RYAN>卡塞尔  那家伙很放松也很配合
<13-4,RYAN>Castle, the guy was relaxed and fully cooperative.

243
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,790
<13-4,RYAN>没有搜查令都让我进屋查看了
<13-4,RYAN>He let us poke around without a warrant.

244
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,230
<13-5,CASTLE>他很可能把尸体藏起来了
<13-5,CASTLE>So he probably hid the body.

245
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,520
<13-5,CASTLE>如果他那么镇定  可能是个精神病
<13-5,CASTLE>If he was completely calm, he could be a psychopath.

246
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,000
<13-6,BECKETT>那他女朋友呢
<13-6,BECKETT>What did he say about the girl?

247
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,220
<13-7,ESPOSITO>他承认他们吵了一架
<13-7,ESPOSITO>He admitted they had a fight,

248
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,900
<13-7,ESPOSITO>分手了  然后她就走了
<13-7,ESPOSITO>they broke up, and she left.

249
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,330
<13-8,CASTLE>不可能  那样我会看到她的
<13-8,CASTLE>Not possible. I would've seen her.

250
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,210
<13-9,ESPOSITO>你是一直都在看着吗
<13-9,ESPOSITO>So you were watching the whole time?

251
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,310
<13-9,ESPOSITO>我
<13-9,ESPOSITO>I...

252
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,580
<13-10,CASTLE>也不是一直看着  我总得...
<13-10,CASTLE>Well, not the entire time. I had to--

253
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,980
<13-11,ESPOSITO>她可能离开了  但你没看到
<13-11,ESPOSITO>So she could've left and you didn't see?

254
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,950
<13-12,CASTLE>那的确有可能  但是...
<13-12,CASTLE>It's possible, but--

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,300
<13-13,ESPOSITO>他给她电话了
<13-13,ESPOSITO>Because he called her.

256
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,680
<13-13,ESPOSITO>他把电话递给我  我还跟她说话了
<13-13,ESPOSITO>Handed me the phone. I spoke to her.

257
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,950
<13-13,ESPOSITO>她确认了他所说的  她当时在车里
<13-13,ESPOSITO>She confirmed his story. She was in the car

258
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,970
<13-13,ESPOSITO>正在去费城她妈妈那里的路上
<13-13,ESPOSITO>on her way to her mom's house in Philadelphia.

259
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,290
<13-14,BECKETT>好了  谢谢  伙计们
<13-14,BECKETT>All right, thanks, guys.

260
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,390
<13-15,CASTLE>我没发疯
<13-15,CASTLE>I'm not crazy.

261
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,510
<13-16,BECKETT>的确  但你一直拥有生动的想象力
<13-16,BECKETT>No, but you do have a vivid imagination...

262
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,450
<13-16,BECKETT>而且你被憋在家两周了
<13-16,BECKETT>And you've been stuck inside for two weeks.

263
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,130
<13-16,BECKETT>你看窗对面的那栋楼做什么
<13-16,BECKETT>What were you doing looking out the window anyway?

264
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,580
<13-17,CASTLE>-我  -太无聊了吗
<13-17,CASTLE>- I was... - bored?

265
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,400
<13-18,BECKETT>你是看到了你想看到的东西
<13-18,BECKETT>So you saw what you wanted to see.

266
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,020
<13-18,BECKETT>你上次吃止痛片是什么时候
<13-18,BECKETT>When did you take your last painkiller?

267
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,680
<13-19,CASTLE>我没有出现幻觉
<13-19,CASTLE>I was not hallucinating.

268
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,280
<13-19,CASTLE>得了吧  卡塞尔
<13-19,CASTLE>Come on, Castle.

269
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,600
<13-20,BECKETT>你现在瘸着腿  拿着望远镜
<13-20,BECKETT>You're here with a broken leg, binoculars,

270
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,960
<13-20,BECKETT>看到对面上演《后窗》的现实版剧情
<13-20,BECKETT>seeing a "Rear window" scenario play out across the way.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,460
<13-20,BECKETT>这可能性有多大
<13-20,BECKETT>I mean, what are the odds?

272
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,230
<13-21,CASTLE>巨大的可能
<13-21,CASTLE>Astronomical.

273
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,630
<13-21,CASTLE>好了
<13-21,CASTLE>All right.

274
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,540
<13-22,BECKETT>我去做晚餐  然后扶你上床
<13-22,BECKETT>I'm gonna make us some dinner and then get you to bed.

275
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,890
<14-1,BECKETT>不是吧你
<14-1,BECKETT>Seriously?

276
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,130
<14-2,CASTLE>我可以解释的
<14-2,CASTLE>I can explain.

277
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,990
<14-3,BECKETT>不必了
<14-3,BECKETT>Please don't.

278
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,780
<14-4,CASTLE>听着  他在公寓里来回踱步
<14-4,CASTLE>Listen, he was pacing back and forth in his apartment,

279
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,730
<14-4,CASTLE>他不断看向卧室
<14-4,CASTLE>and he kept looking towards the bedroom.

280
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,090
<14-4,CASTLE>然后  他睡在沙发上了
<14-4,CASTLE>And then he slept on the couch.

281
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,500
<14-4,CASTLE>你明明有张松软舒适的大床
<14-4,CASTLE>Now why would you sleep on the couch

282
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,800
<14-4,CASTLE>为什么要睡在沙发上呢
<14-4,CASTLE>when you have a perfectly good bed?

283
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,490
<14-5,BECKETT>我也该问你同样的问题
<14-5,BECKETT>I could ask you the same question.

284
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,320
<14-6,CASTLE>我来告诉你原因
<14-6,CASTLE>I'll tell you why.

285
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,540
<14-6,CASTLE>因为他在里面藏了一具尸体
<14-6,CASTLE>Because he had a dead body in there.

286
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,040
<14-6,CASTLE>莱恩和埃斯波西托没有发现
<14-6,CASTLE>Ryan and Esposito didn't find it

287
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,040
<14-6,CASTLE>因为他藏起来了
<14-6,CASTLE>Because he hid it.

288
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,090
<14-7,BECKETT>你知道自己在干什么吗
<14-7,BECKETT>Do you realize what you're doing?

289
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,580
<14-7,BECKETT>你现在完全痴迷于这件事
<14-7,BECKETT>You're obsessing over this

290
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,520
<14-7,BECKETT>因为你没有其他可痴迷的东西
<14-7,BECKETT>because you have nothing else to obsess about.

291
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,130
<14-7,BECKETT>你今天不如跟我去警局吧
<14-7,BECKETT>Why don't you just come with me to the precinct?

292
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,260
<14-7,BECKETT>把注意力放在真的谋杀案上
<14-7,BECKETT>Focus on a real murder

293
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,740
<14-7,BECKETT>而不是把时间都浪费在幻想出的案子上
<14-7,BECKETT>instead of wasting your time on an imaginary one.

294
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,670
<14-8,CASTLE>实际上  我打算
<14-8,CASTLE>Well, actually, I was thinking about just, uh,

295
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,440
<14-8,CASTLE>今天试着写作
<14-8,CASTLE>trying to do some writing today.

296
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,400
<14-9,BECKETT>好吧  希望你说的"写作"不是指
<14-9,BECKETT>Okay, as long as by "writing," You don't mean

297
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,510
<14-9,BECKETT>盯着窗户  对邻居眉目传情
<14-9,BECKETT>staring out the window and ogling at your neighbors.

298
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,330
<14-10,CASTLE>不会  那样不道德也是在侵扰人家
<14-10,CASTLE>No. That would be immoral and intrusive.

299
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,850
<14-11,BECKETT>说得好像你从没干过这种事一样
<14-11,BECKETT>Yeah, like you've never done that before.

300
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,690
<15-2,ESPOSITO>吉米·斯图沃特怎么样了[《后窗》主演]
<15-2,ESPOSITO>Hey. How's Jimmy Stewart?

301
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,460
<15-3,BECKETT>大半夜都睡不着
<15-3,BECKETT>You know, up half the night

302
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,210
<15-3,BECKETT>等待着那个邻居转移尸体
<15-3,BECKETT>waiting for the neighbor to move the body.

303
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,960
<15-3,BECKETT>技术人员对小巷杀手的车分析得有结果了吗
<15-3,BECKETT>So did tech get anything on our killer's car in the alley?

304
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,670
<15-4,ESPOSITO>是的  他们分析出那是新款
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, they identified it as a late-model,

305
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,080
<15-4,ESPOSITO>浅色CLS550车
<15-4,ESPOSITO>light-colored cls550.

306
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,310
<15-4,ESPOSITO>我已经安排人翻查克莱拉的审计纪录
<15-4,ESPOSITO>I've got folks combing over Clara's audit records

307
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,580
<15-4,ESPOSITO>看看有没有人把这辆车列为申报物
<15-4,ESPOSITO>to see if anyone lists that vehicle on their return.

308
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,370
<15-5,RYAN>我刚跟克莱拉公司的保安通完电话
<15-5,RYAN>So I just got off the phone with security at Clara's office.

309
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,110
<15-5,RYAN>几周前
<15-5,RYAN>A few weeks back,

310
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,030
<15-5,RYAN>这家伙试图用暴力闯过保安的阻拦
<15-5,RYAN>this guy tried to muscle his way past security.

311
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,700
<15-5,RYAN>他们试图扣留他  但被他突围了
<15-5,RYAN>Now they tried to detain him, but he broke free

312
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,390
<15-5,RYAN>然后他冲出了停车场  开的是
<15-5,RYAN>and he tore out of the parking lot in...

313
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,480
<15-6,ESPOSITO>CLS550的车
<15-6,ESPOSITO>A cls550.

314
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,480
<15-7,BECKETT>这人很像加文说来纠缠他老婆的家伙
<15-7,BECKETT>This looks like the guy Gavin said was after his wife.

315
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,700
<15-8,RYAN>是的  所以我把这张照片
<15-8,RYAN>Yeah, so I compared that photo

316
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,170
<15-8,RYAN>和克莱拉的审计文件进行对比
<15-8,RYAN>to Cara's audit files,

317
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,440
<15-8,RYAN>然后我找到了这个人
<15-8,RYAN>And I got a hit on this guy--

318
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,010
<15-8,RYAN>丹·瑞纳
<15-8,RYAN>Dan Renner.

319
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,270
<15-8,RYAN>他是个反政府  提倡自由的激进分子
<15-8,RYAN>He is an anti-government pro-freedom hothead

320
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,550
<15-8,RYAN>依靠在布鲁克林开的连锁干洗店发了横财
<15-8,RYAN>who made a fortune on a chain of dry cleaners in Brooklyn

321
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,850
<15-8,RYAN>他已经将近10年没交过税了
<15-8,RYAN>that he's neglected to pay taxes on in nearly a decade.

322
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,230
<15-8,RYAN>因为克莱尔的审计  他正面临刑事起诉
<15-8,RYAN>And because of Clara's audit, he's facing criminal charges

323
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,930
<15-8,RYAN>他妻子刚刚提出了离婚申请
<15-8,RYAN>And his wife just filed for divorce.

324
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,640
<15-9,ESPOSITO>听上去他一定恨不得用斧头劈了克莱拉
<15-9,ESPOSITO>Sounds like someone who has an ax to grind.

325
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,370
<15-10,BECKETT>或是挥棒行凶  去把他带过来
<15-10,BECKETT>Or a bat to swing. Pick him up.

326
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,200
<15-10,BECKETT>好的
<15-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

327
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,950
<16-1,CASTLE>你买了绳子和帆布
<16-1,CASTLE>You bought rope and a tarp.

328
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,700
<16-1,CASTLE>你要帆布干什么呢
<16-1,CASTLE>Now what would you need a tarp for?

329
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,440
<16-2,CASTLE>那是血
<16-2,CASTLE>It's blood.

330
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,580
<16-2,CASTLE>你要洗掉...
<16-2,CASTLE>You're washing away the--

331
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,030
<16-2,CASTLE>他要洗掉血...
<16-2,CASTLE>He's washing away the bl--

332
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,300
<16-2,CASTLE>他们抢走了我的房子  我的婚姻
<16-2,CASTLE>They took my house, my marriage,

333
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,380
<17-1,DAN RENNER>我很可能要被判入狱
<17-1,DAN RENNER>I was facing a jail sentence.

334
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,330
<17-1,DAN RENNER>所以  是的
<17-1,DAN RENNER>So, yeah,

335
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,260
<17-1,DAN RENNER>我想跟德温特太太谈谈
<17-1,DAN RENNER>I wanted to have a few words with Mrs. Dewinter

337
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,770
<17-1,DAN RENNER>关于自由国土的一些事
<17-1,DAN RENNER>about the land of the free.

338
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,320
<17-1,DAN RENNER>那并不代表我杀了她
<17-1,DAN RENNER>That doesn't mean I killed her.

339
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,250
<17-2,ESPOSITO>你知道那是什么吗
<17-2,ESPOSITO>You know what that is?

340
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,590
<17-2,ESPOSITO>那是辆银色CLS550的车  就跟你开的一样
<17-2,ESPOSITO>That's a silver cls550, just like the one you drive,

341
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,110
<17-2,ESPOSITO>从她的被害现场逃离
<17-2,ESPOSITO>fleeing her murder scene.

342
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,110
<17-3,RENNER>是跟我曾经开的那辆一样
<17-3,RENNER>Just like the one I drove.

343
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,110
<17-3,RENNER>我的550车两周前已经被联邦探员没收了
<17-3,RENNER>Look, my 550 was seized by federal agents two weeks ago.

344
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,670
<17-3,RENNER>你们可以去查
<17-3,RENNER>You can check.

345
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,380
<17-3,RENNER>考虑到德温特太太原本打算为我做的事
<17-3,RENNER>And given what Mrs. Dewinter was gonna do for me,

346
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,000
<17-3,RENNER>我是最不希望她死的人
<17-3,RENNER>I'm the last person who wanted her dead.

347
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,630
<17-4,BECKETT>她原打算为你做一件事
<17-4,BECKETT>Going to do for you?

348
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,050
<17-4,BECKETT>是的
<17-4,BECKETT>Yeah.

349
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,760
<17-5,RENNER>她一周前来找我的
<17-5,RENNER>She came to see me a week ago,

350
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,530
<17-5,RENNER>她说她需要帮助  如果我帮了她
<17-5,RENNER>said she needed a favor, and if I helped her,

351
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,690
<17-5,RENNER>她可以让我免于遭受刑事起诉
<17-5,RENNER>She'd make the criminal charges go away.

352
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,690
<17-6,BECKETT>她会需要你帮什么忙
<17-6,BECKETT>What kind of a favor could she possibly have wanted from you?

353
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,160
<17-7,RENNER>因为我把钱藏得有多好
<17-7,RENNER>Because of how well I hid my money--

354
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,110
<17-7,RENNER>假名字  多重身份
<17-7,RENNER>Fake names, multiple I.D.s--

355
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,360
<17-7,RENNER>她让我帮她消失
<17-7,RENNER>She asked me to help her disappear.

356
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,360
<17-8,ESPOSITO>消失
<17-8,ESPOSITO>Disappear?

357
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,870
<17-9,RENNER>是的  她说如果我帮她弄个新的身份
<17-9,RENNER>Yeah. She said if I helped her get a new identity,

358
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,420
<17-9,RENNER>她就会帮我找回原来的生活
<17-9,RENNER>she'd help me get my life back.

359
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,210
<17-10,BECKETT>为什么她想要个新的身份
<17-10,BECKETT>And why would she want a new identity?

360
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,270
<17-11,RENNER>她没说
<17-11,RENNER>She didn't say.

361
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,650
<17-11,RENNER>但现在她死了  我就完了
<17-11,RENNER>But now she's dead, and I'm screwed.

362
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,620
<17-12,BECKETT>瑞纳先生  两天前的晚上1点38你在哪
<17-12,BECKETT>Mr. Renner, where were you 2 nights ago at 1:38 a.M.?

363
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,880
<17-13,RENNER>在我妹妹家
<17-13,RENNER>At my sister's.

364
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,120
<17-14,RYAN>贝克特  卡塞尔的电话
<17-14,RYAN>Beckett, Castle's calling.

365
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,600
<17-14,RYAN>他说有紧急情况
<17-14,RYAN>He says it's an emergency.

366
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,610
<18-1,BECKETT>这算哪门子的紧急情况
<18-1,BECKETT>This is not an emergency.

367
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,230
<18-2,CASTLE>我撞见他的手上沾满鲜血  真正的满手红
<18-2,CASTLE>I caught him red-handed. Literally red-handed.

368
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,950
<18-3,BECKETT>那就肯定是血吗
<18-3,BECKETT>Ooh, so then it's gotta be blood?

369
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,030
<18-4,CASTLE>还有其它可能吗
<18-4,CASTLE>What else could it be?

370
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,680
<18-5,BECKETT>红油漆  番茄汁
<18-5,BECKETT>Red paint, tomato juice,

371
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,760
<18-5,BECKETT>甜菜  红丝绒纸杯蛋糕
<18-5,BECKETT>beets, red velvet cupcakes.

372
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,000
<18-5,BECKETT>他买了帆布和绳子
<18-5,BECKETT>He bought a tarp and a rope.

373
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,370
<18-6,CASTLE>拿进了卧室
<18-6,CASTLE>He brought them into the bedroom,

374
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,690
<18-6,CASTLE>我敢打赌
<18-6,CASTLE>where I'm betting right now,

375
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,840
<18-6,CASTLE>他正在把她的尸体切成小块
<18-6,CASTLE>he's cutting her into portable pieces.

376
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,800
<19-2,BECKETT>去申请搜查令
<19-2,BECKETT>Get a warrant.

377
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,370
<18-6,CASTLE>在证据被销毁之前搜查那里
<18-6,CASTLE>Search that place before there's no evidence left.

378
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,890
<18-7,BECKETT>埃斯波西托跟她说了话
<18-7,BECKETT>Esposito spoke to the girl.

379
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,460
<18-7,BECKETT>我们知道她还活着
<18-7,BECKETT>We know she's alive.

380
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,200
<18-8,CASTLE>你们怎么知道她们是同一个人
<18-8,CASTLE>How do you know it's the same girl?

381
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,140
<18-8,CASTLE>他可能花了钱请人伪造不在场证明
<18-8,CASTLE>It's possible he paid someone to be his alibi.

382
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,600
<18-9,BECKETT>或者有可能整件事都不是这样的
<18-9,BECKETT>Or it's possible something else entirely is going on here.

383
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,360
<18-9,BECKETT>听着
<18-9,BECKETT>Look...

384
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,520
<18-9,BECKETT>我知道你很寂寞  很想我
<18-9,BECKETT>I know that you're lonely and that you miss me.

385
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,350
<18-9,BECKETT>我也想你啊
<18-9,BECKETT>I miss you, too.

386
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,970
<18-9,BECKETT>但你不用一直编故事
<18-9,BECKETT>But you don't have to keep making up things

387
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,200
<18-9,BECKETT>引我回来
<18-9,BECKETT>to have me come back here.

388
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,670
<18-10,CASTLE>等等  你以为这是我引你回来的小花招
<18-10,CASTLE>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think this is a ploy to get you here?

389
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,660
<18-11,BECKETT>听着  我不是有意这么说
<18-11,BECKETT>Look, I don't mean to be that--

390
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
<18-12,CASTLE>我知道你的意思  好吗
<18-12,CASTLE>No, I know what you mean. All right?

391
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,110
<18-12,CASTLE>我也知道自己看见了什么
<18-12,CASTLE>And I know what I saw.

392
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,310
<18-13,BECKETT>好吧  跟你说
<18-13,BECKETT>All right, you know what?

393
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,270
<18-13,BECKETT>我得回分局了
<18-13,BECKETT>I have to get back to the precinct.

394
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,330
<18-14,CASTLE>天呐  你真的不信我
<18-14,CASTLE>Wow. You really don't believe me.

395
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,620
<18-15,BECKETT>回头见
<18-15,BECKETT>I'll be back later.

396
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,190
<18-16,CASTLE>跟你说  算了吧
<18-16,CASTLE>You know what? Don't worry about it.

397
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,840
<18-16,CASTLE>我没事
<18-16,CASTLE>I'm fine.

398
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,820
<19-1,ESPOSITO>紧急情况是什么
<19-1,ESPOSITO>What was the emergency?

399
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,310
<19-2,BECKETT>他让我去申请搜查令
<19-2,BECKETT>He wanted me to get a warrant

400
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,150
<19-2,BECKETT>搜查街对面那间公寓
<19-2,BECKETT>to search the place across the way.

401
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,210
<19-2,BECKETT>他好像特别重视这件事
<19-2,BECKETT>Looks like he's taking this whole thing pretty seriously.

402
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,780
<19-3,ESPOSITO>我们有必要担心他吗
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Should we be worried?

403
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,860
<19-4,BECKETT>我只希望他别做什么傻事
<19-4,BECKETT>I just hope he doesn't do something stupid.

404
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,480
<19-4,BECKETT>丹·瑞纳这边查得怎么样了
<19-4,BECKETT>Where--where are we with Dan Renner?

405
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
<19-5,ESPOSITO>他的不在场证明成立了
<19-5,ESPOSITO>His alibi checks out,

406
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,440
<19-5,ESPOSITO>关于他的车  说的是实话
<19-5,ESPOSITO>and he was telling the truth about his car.

407
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,820
<19-6,BECKETT>可能关于克莱拉的事也是实话
<19-6,BECKETT>Maybe he's telling the truth about Clara as well.

408
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,970
<19-6,BECKETT>深入调查一下她的生活情况
<19-6,BECKETT>Let's dig deeper into her life,

409
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,340
<19-6,BECKETT>看看能有什么发现
<19-6,BECKETT>see if we can find anything.

410
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,800
<19-6,BECKETT>谢谢
<19-6,BECKETT>Thanks.

411
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,550
<20-1,CASTLE>他要处理尸体
<20-1,CASTLE>He's getting rid of the body.

412
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,720
<20-1,CASTLE>贝克特这下必须信我了
<20-1,CASTLE>Beckett's gonna have to believe me now.

413
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,400
<20-1,CASTLE>很好
<20-1,CASTLE>Okay.

414
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,440
<20-1,CASTLE>哪个是...好了  开始
<20-1,CASTLE>Where's the... there we go. There we--there we go.

415
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
<20-1,CASTLE>别介啊
<20-1,CASTLE>No. No. No!

416
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,410
<20-1,CASTLE>如果你觉得他在弃尸
<20-1,CASTLE>If you thought he was getting rid of the body,

417
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,770
<21-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>你为什么不联系贝克特
<21-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Why didn't you call Beckett?

418
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,650
<21-2,CASTLE>她觉得这些都是我编出来的
<21-2,CASTLE>Well, she thinks it's all in my head--

419
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,340
<21-2,CASTLE>是想象力和止痛药产生的副作用
<21-2,CASTLE>A by-product of my imagination and pain pills.

420
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,410
<21-3,ALEXIS>就像你那段时间确信
<21-3,ALEXIS>Like that time you were convinced

421
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,660
<21-3,ALEXIS>我的艺术老师是连环杀手
<21-3,ALEXIS>my art teacher was a serial killer.

422
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,300
<21-4,CASTLE>拜托  他看起来就像
<21-4,CASTLE>Come on. He looked just like the guy

423
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,760
<21-4,CASTLE>《全美首要通缉犯》节目里的人
<21-4,CASTLE>from "America's most wanted."

424
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,580
<21-5,ALEXIS>你有没有想过
<21-5,ALEXIS>Did you ever stop to think that maybe

425
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,390
<21-5,ALEXIS>或许一切都有单纯的解释
<21-5,ALEXIS>there's an innocent explanation for everything?

426
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,080
<21-5,ALEXIS>好吧
<21-5,ALEXIS>All right,

427
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,350
<21-6,CASTLE>要怎么单纯地解释卷起地毯
<21-6,CASTLE>what is the innocent explanation for rolling up a rug

428
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,090
<21-6,CASTLE>并在凌晨三点搬出公寓
<21-6,CASTLE>and taking it out of your apartment at 3:00 a.M.?

429
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,410
<21-6,CASTLE>也是
<21-6,CASTLE>Yeah.

430
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,540
<21-7,ALEXIS>太古怪了
<21-7,ALEXIS>That is pretty weird.

431
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,430
<21-7,ALEXIS>对吧
<21-7,ALEXIS>Right?

432
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,170
<21-8,CASTLE>而且他早晨四点半才回来
<21-8,CASTLE>And then he didn't come back until 4:30 this morning.

433
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,360
<21-8,CASTLE>他去了哪
<21-8,CASTLE>Where'd he go?

434
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,640
<21-9,ALEXIS>我不知道  不过他起床了
<21-9,ALEXIS>I don't know, but he's up now.

435
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,810
<21-10,CASTLE>他在干什么
<21-10,CASTLE>What's he doing?

436
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,050
<21-11,ALEXIS>-嗯  他...  -怎么了
<21-11,ALEXIS>- Uh, I--he, uh... - What?

437
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,350
<21-12,CASTLE>你看到什么了
<21-12,CASTLE>What do you see?

438
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,870
<21-13,ALEXIS>他在脱衣服
<21-13,ALEXIS>He's taking off his clothes.

439
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,010
<21-14,CASTLE>什么  望远镜还我
<21-14,CASTLE>What? Give me those.

440
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,920
<21-15,ALEXIS>真性感啊
<21-15,ALEXIS>Mm. He's cute.

441
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,600
<21-16,CASTLE>行了
<21-16,CASTLE>Ooh. All right.

442
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,550
<21-16,CASTLE>不  我...
<21-16,CASTLE>No, I...

443
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,750
<21-17,CASTLE>不是吧
<21-17,CASTLE>Seriously?

444
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,280
<21-17,CASTLE>你不该看的
<21-17,CASTLE>You shouldn't be watching this.

445
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,800
<21-18,ALEXIS>是啊  你也不该看
<21-18,ALEXIS>Yeah, neither should you.

446
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,620
<21-19,CASTLE>搞什么...
<21-19,CASTLE>What the...

447
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,000
<21-20,ALEXIS>好恐怖
<21-20,ALEXIS>That's creepy.

448
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,700
<22-1,RYAN>盯着电话看它也不会响的
<22-1,RYAN>Staring at the phone won't make it ring.

449
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,240
<22-1,RYAN>我初中就明白这点了
<22-1,RYAN>I learned that in junior high.

450
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,710
<22-2,BECKETT>也许我应该去看看他
<22-2,BECKETT>You know what? Maybe I should go over there.

451
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,030
<22-2,BECKETT>明天是他的生日
<22-2,BECKETT>I mean, his birthday is tomorrow--

452
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,660
<22-3,ESPOSITO>相信我  他准备好了会打给你的
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Trust me. He'll call when he's ready.

453
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,950
<22-3,ESPOSITO>你一定不想错过这个消息
<22-3,ESPOSITO>And you're not gonna want to miss this.

454
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
<22-4,RYAN>我们又查了一遍克莱拉的所有记录
<22-4,RYAN>We went back through all of Clara's records.

455
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,290
<22-4,RYAN>发现她是有所隐瞒
<22-4,RYAN>Turns out that she was hiding something.

456
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,210
<22-5,ESPOSITO>一个超过五十万的秘密银行账户
<22-5,ESPOSITO>Over half a million dollars in a secret bank account.

457
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,710
<22-5,ESPOSITO>她用尽一切合法手段隐瞒这个账户
<22-5,ESPOSITO>She used every legal trick to hide it.

458
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,560
<22-5,ESPOSITO>没有人  甚至她丈夫都不知道
<22-5,ESPOSITO>Nobody, not even her husband, knew about it.

459
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,190
<22-6,BECKETT>她年薪七万五
<22-6,BECKETT>This girl made 75k a year.

460
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,050
<22-6,BECKETT>怎么弄到五十万的
<22-6,BECKETT>How'd she get her hands on half a mil?

461
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,390
<22-7,RYAN>起初我们以为她勒索了受审方
<22-7,RYAN>Well, at first we thought she was shaking down her auditees,

462
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,380
<22-7,RYAN>但我们后来追踪了存款
<22-7,RYAN>but then we traced the deposits.

463
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,090
<22-8,ESPOSITO>发现全部是汤米 瓦伦迪诺本人的
<22-8,ESPOSITO>All from businesses owned or affiliated

464
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,360
<22-8,ESPOSITO>或隶属于他的生意所得
<22-8,ESPOSITO>to Tommy Valentino.

465
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,490
<22-9,BECKETT>"大鲨鱼"汤米 瓦伦迪诺
<22-9,BECKETT>Tommy "The shark" Valentino?

466
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
<22-9,BECKETT>国税局公务员为什么收受犯罪头目的钱
<22-9,BECKETT>Why is an I.R.S. agent taking payoffs from a crime boss?

467
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,230
<22-10,ESPOSITO>我不知道  但想要消失
<22-10,ESPOSITO>I don't know, but wanting to disappear

468
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,670
<22-10,ESPOSITO>后来又在小巷被袭击
<22-10,ESPOSITO>and then getting whacked in an alley--

469
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,020
<22-10,ESPOSITO>都开始说得通了
<22-10,ESPOSITO>It's all starting to make sense.

470
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,540
<23-1,ALEXIS>已经两个小时了
<23-1,ALEXIS>It's been two hours.

471
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,530
<23-1,ALEXIS>他在里面做什么
<23-1,ALEXIS>What's he doing in there?

472
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,700
<23-1,ALEXIS>销毁证据
<23-1,ALEXIS>Getting rid of evidence--

473
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,960
<23-2,ALEXIS>血迹  DNA痕迹
<23-2,ALEXIS>Blood stains... trace D.N.A.

474
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,630
<23-2,ALEXIS>不久之后  所有证据都没了
<23-2,ALEXIS>Pretty soon, there's gonna be nothing left.

475
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,910
<23-2,ALEXIS>他出来了  出来了
<23-2,ALEXIS>Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

476
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,600
<23-3,ALEXIS>袋子里装了什么
<23-3,ALEXIS>What's in the bags?

477
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,270
<23-4,CASTLE>他已经把尸体卷在毯子里运出去了
<23-4,CASTLE>He took the body out in a rug.

478
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,530
<23-4,CASTLE>可能是衣服  床上用品
<23-4,CASTLE>That could be clothing, bedding.

479
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,460
<23-5,ALEXIS>那是她的手提包
<23-5,ALEXIS>That's her purse.

480
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,450
<23-5,ALEXIS>如果他们分手了  她不可能不带走手提包
<23-5,ALEXIS>If they broke up, no way she left without her purse.

481
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,060
<23-6,CASTLE>她没离开那间公寓
<23-6,CASTLE>She did not leave that apartment,

482
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,450
<23-6,CASTLE>起码没有活着离开
<23-6,CASTLE>at least not alive.

483
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,830
<23-7,CASTLE>他在销毁她的证件
<23-7,CASTLE>And now he's obliterating her identity.

484
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,760
<23-8,ALEXIS>我们必须给贝克特打电话
<23-8,ALEXIS>We need to call Beckett.

485
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,940
<23-9,CASTLE>告诉她什么
<23-9,CASTLE>And tell her what?

486
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,110
<23-9,CASTLE>说我们看到一个男人戴着手套和口罩吗
<23-9,CASTLE>That we saw a man donning gloves and--and a respirator?

487
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,510
<23-9,CASTLE>他完全有可能只是在清扫洗手间
<23-9,CASTLE>For all we know, he's cleaning the bathroom.

488
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,340
<24-4,CASTLE>不行
<24-4,CASTLE>No.

489
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,570
<24-5,ALEXIS>我得让贝克特相信我没疯
<24-5,ALEXIS>If I'm gonna convince Beckett I'm not crazy,

490
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,180
<24-6,CASTLE>我要证据
<24-6,CASTLE>I need proof,

491
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,090
<23-9,CASTLE>确凿的证据
<23-9,CASTLE>something solid.

492
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,520
<24-1,ALEXIS>爸  你不能闯进他的公寓
<24-1,ALEXIS>Dad, you can't break in to his apartment.

493
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,270
<24-2,CASTLE>我们需要的所有证据都在那台碎纸机里
<24-2,CASTLE>All the evidence we need is in that shredder.

494
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,300
<24-2,CASTLE>那会让我们知道死者是谁
<24-2,CASTLE>It'll tell us who the victim is.

495
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,340
<24-2,CASTLE>我们就能证明她失踪了
<24-2,CASTLE>We can prove she's missing.

496
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,590
<24-3,ALEXIS>要是他抓到你呢
<24-3,ALEXIS>And what if he catches you?

497
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,950
<24-4,CASTLE>不会的  有你帮忙就不会
<24-4,CASTLE>He won't, not if I have your help.

498
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,080
<24-4,CASTLE>下次他离开  我就溜过去看看
<24-4,CASTLE>Next time he leaves, I'll slip over there.

499
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,080
<24-4,CASTLE>你给我放哨  确保他没回来
<24-4,CASTLE>You keep watch, make sure he's not coming back.

500
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,070
<24-4,CASTLE>我进去  把碎纸机里的东西都拿出来
<24-4,CASTLE>I go inside, I get whatever's in that shredder,

501
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,570
<24-4,CASTLE>再出来
<24-4,CASTLE>and I get out.

502
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,990
<24-4,CASTLE>最多两分钟
<24-4,CASTLE>Two minutes, tops.

503
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,970
<24-5,ALEXIS>撑着拐杖吗
<24-5,ALEXIS>On crutches?

504
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,490
<24-6,CASTLE>医生的确说我需要多锻炼
<24-6,CASTLE>The doctor did say I need more exercise.

505
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,700
<24-7,ALEXIS>我去吧  我个头更小  速度更快  也更年轻
<24-7,ALEXIS>What if I go? I'm smaller, faster, and younger.

506
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,090
<24-8,CASTLE>不不不  你要是被抓
<24-8,CASTLE>Oh, no, no, no. If you get caught,

507
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,230
<24-8,CASTLE>就会有非法闯入的案底
<24-8,CASTLE>you get a b&e on your record,

508
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,370
<24-8,CASTLE>就永远当不了总统了
<24-8,CASTLE>and you'll never become president.

509
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,330
<24-9,ALEXIS>爸
<24-9,ALEXIS>Dad...

510
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,250
<24-10,CASTLE>他要逃脱谋杀罪名了
<24-10,CASTLE>He's getting away with murder.

511
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,020
<24-10,CASTLE>你有更好的计划吗
<24-10,CASTLE>You got a better plan?

512
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,990
<25-1,BECKETT>这里有对你的多项指控
<25-1,BECKETT>You got a long list of indictments against you,

513
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,430
<25-1,BECKETT>瓦伦迪诺先生
<25-1,BECKETT>Mr. Valentino--

514
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,790
<25-1,BECKETT>袭击  勒索  一级谋杀
<25-1,BECKETT>Assault, racketeering, murder one--

515
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,840
<25-1,BECKETT>但是  都没定罪
<25-1,BECKETT>And yet, no convictions.

516
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,780
<25-2,TOMMY VALENTINO>我在这方面比较幸运
<25-2,TOMMY VALENTINO>I'm lucky that way.

517
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,170
<25-3,BECKETT>你的运气就快用完了
<25-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, your luck's about to run out.

518
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,880
<25-3,BECKETT>我有证据证明你曾付款给我的被害人
<25-3,BECKETT>I have evidence connecting you to payments made to my vic--

519
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,810
<25-3,BECKETT>克莱拉·德温特
<25-3,BECKETT>Clara Dewinter.

520
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,840
<25-4,LAWYER>我的委托人无可奉告
<25-4,LAWYER>My client has no comment.

521
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,310
<25-5,VALENTINO>等等  有人杀了克莱拉
<25-5,VALENTINO>Whoa, whoa, wait. Someone killed Clara?

522
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,640
<25-6,BECKETT>看来他有话可奉告
<25-6,BECKETT>Oh, it looks like he does have a comment.

523
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,220
<25-6,BECKETT>你现在承认认识她了吗
<25-6,BECKETT>So you're admitting to knowing her?

524
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,390
<25-6,BECKETT>是啊
<25-6,BECKETT>Yeah.

525
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,320
<25-7,VALENTINO>可我没杀她
<25-7,VALENTINO>But I didn't kill her.

526
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,060
<25-7,VALENTINO>她是我的税务顾问
<25-7,VALENTINO>She was my tax consultant.

527
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,060
<25-8,BECKETT>你付给一个国税局人员50万
<25-8,BECKETT>You paid an I.R.S. agent half a million dollars

528
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,750
<25-8,BECKETT>担任你的税务顾问
<25-8,BECKETT>to act as your tax consultant?

529
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,220
<25-9,VALENTINO>没错  谁都别想坑我
<25-9,VALENTINO>You bet your ass. No one's gonna Al Capone me.

530
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,880
<25-10,BECKETT>好  如果这是合法收入
<25-10,BECKETT>Okay, if this was a legitimate arrangement,

531
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
<25-10,BECKETT>那克莱拉·德温特为什么要大费周章
<25-10,BECKETT>then why did Clara Dewinter go to such lengths

532
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,990
<25-10,BECKETT>把那笔钱藏起来
<25-10,BECKETT>to keep that money hidden?

533
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,820
<25-11,VALENTINO>她是怕她老公发现那笔钱
<25-11,VALENTINO>She hid the money from her husband.

534
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,890
<25-11,VALENTINO>所以她开始才会接这份工作
<25-11,VALENTINO>That's why she took this job in the first place.

535
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,100
<25-11,VALENTINO>她怕他
<25-11,VALENTINO>She was afraid of him.

536
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,940
<25-11,VALENTINO>她要钱脱身
<25-11,VALENTINO>She needed the money to get away.

537
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,900
<26-1,BECKETT>汤米的不在场证明没问题
<26-1,BECKETT>Tommy the shark's alibi holds.

538
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,850
<26-1,BECKETT>案发时他和几个同伴在自己开的夜总会里
<26-1,BECKETT>He was with some associates at a nightclub that he owns.

539
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,220
<26-2,ESPOSITO>那不代表他没有买凶杀人
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Doesn't mean he didn't send one of his boys.

540
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,280
<26-3,BECKETT>听着  如果是他杀了克莱拉
<26-3,BECKETT>Look, if he killed Clara,

541
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,740
<26-3,BECKETT>就不会向我透露信息了
<26-3,BECKETT>he wouldn't have talked to me.

542
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,610
<26-3,BECKETT>不是他
<26-3,BECKETT>No.

543
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,500
<26-3,BECKETT>死者藏钱  计划消失
<26-3,BECKETT>Hiding the money, planning to disappear--

544
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
<26-3,BECKETT>肯定有别的隐情
<26-3,BECKETT>Something else is going on here.

545
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,520
<26-3,BECKETT>你查到她丈夫的什么信息了
<26-3,BECKETT>So what do you got on the husband?

546
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,770
<26-4,RYAN>不多
<26-4,RYAN>Oh, not much.

547
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,400
<26-4,RYAN>他是皇后区一家知名超市的经理
<26-4,RYAN>He's a manager at a big-name supermarket in Queens,

548
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,300
<26-4,RYAN>没有前科  结婚七年
<26-4,RYAN>No priors, married seven years.

549
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
<26-4,RYAN>就在三个月前  他买了份一百万的人寿保险
<26-4,RYAN>Oh, and he took a million-dollar life insurance policy out

550
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,310
<26-4,RYAN>被保人是他的妻子
<26-4,RYAN>on his wife only three months ago.

551
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,860
<26-5,ESPOSITO>那真是一点都"不可疑"啊
<26-5,ESPOSITO>That's not suspicious.

552
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,280
<26-5,ESPOSITO>你觉得是他杀了人嫁祸给瑞纳吗
<26-5,ESPOSITO>You think he did it and set Renner up?

553
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,750
<26-6,BECKETT>在餐厅发生那样的事后
<26-6,BECKETT>After what happened at the restaurant,

554
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,570
<26-6,BECKETT>要那样做也很简单
<26-6,BECKETT>it would've been easy.

555
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,290
<26-6,BECKETT>他只需要租一辆和瑞纳一样的CLS车
<26-6,BECKETT>All he'd have to do is rent Renner's same CLS sedan

556
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,420
<26-6,BECKETT>把脸遮住
<26-6,BECKETT>and keep his face hidden.

557
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,000
<26-7,ESPOSITO>还要确保车被人看见
<26-7,ESPOSITO>While making sure the car was seen.

558
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,020
<26-8,BECKETT>好  把他带来
<26-8,BECKETT>All right. Pick him up.

559
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,820
<27-1,ALEXIS>安全  完毕
<27-1,ALEXIS>All clear. Over.

560
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,130
<27-1,ALEXIS>爸  别
<27-1,ALEXIS>Dad, no.

561
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,290
<27-1,ALEXIS>只管拿上东西走人  完毕
<27-1,ALEXIS>Just get the stuff and get out of there. Over.

562
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,740
<28-1,ALEXIS>只要一分钟  完毕
<28-1,ALEXIS>It'll only take a minute. Over.

563
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,620
<28-2,CASTLE>漂白剂和油漆
<28-2,CASTLE>Bleach and paint.

564
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,400
<28-3,CASTLE>你想掩盖什么
<28-3,CASTLE>What are you trying to cover up?

565
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,530
<28-3,CASTLE>血迹
<28-3,CASTLE>Bloodstains?

566
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,710
<28-4,CASTLE>就是这个
<28-4,CASTLE>This is it!

567
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,200
<28-4,CASTLE>他就是在这里杀人的
<28-4,CASTLE>This is where he killed her.

568
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,300
<28-4,CASTLE>所以莱恩才没看见任何血
<28-4,CASTLE>This is why Ryan didn't see any blood.

569
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,550
<28-4,CASTLE>都在这里
<28-4,CASTLE>It was all in here!

578
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,460
<29-4,MICHAEL>可我不能把它永远留在那里
<29-4,MICHAEL>but I can't leave it there forever.

579
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,920
<29-4,MICHAEL>不

581
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,450
<29-5,MICHAEL>我在考虑吉米的船
<29-5,MICHAEL>Well, I was thinking Jimmy's boat.

582
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,330
<29-5,MICHAEL>趁他在工作时
<29-5,MICHAEL>While he's at work.

583
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:13,990
<29-5,MICHAEL>他不会知道的
<29-5,MICHAEL>He'd never know.

584
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,210
<30-1,GAVIN>你以为是我干的
<30-1,GAVIN>You think I did this?

585
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,810
<30-1,GAVIN>你觉得我可能伤害我妻子吗
<30-1,GAVIN>You think I could possibly hurt my wife?

586
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,760
<30-1,GAVIN>我说了  我们很幸福
<30-1,GAVIN>I told you, we were happy.

587
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,290
<30-2,BECKETT>她妹妹可不是这么说的
<30-2,BECKETT>Not according to her sister.

588

611
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,960
<32-2,CASTLE>重要的是他做了什么

<32-4,CASTLE>Not just any storage facility. This one's open 24 hours.

618
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,600
<32-5,ALEXIS>看他租下这里的时间
<32-5,ALEXIS>Yeah, look what time he rented the space.

<32-6,BECKETT>凌晨3点43分
<32-6,BECKETT>3:43 A.M.

620

621
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,370
<32-7,CASTLE>我看见他拖着地毯离开他的公寓
<32-7,CASTLE>I watched him pull a rug out of his apartment.

622
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,690
<32-7,CASTLE>你知道地毯恰好能包裹住什么吗
<32-7,CASTLE>You know what fits in a rug?

623
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,690
<32-8,ALEXIS>尸体
<32-8,ALEXIS>A body.

624
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,150
<32-9,CASTLE>他打算先把尸体放在那里
<32-9,CASTLE>That's where he's storing her

625
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,300
<32-9,CASTLE>等想好了处理方法再去弄
<32-9,CASTLE>until he can figure out what to do.

626
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,010
<32-10,BECKETT>或者那个地毯是他女朋友的
<32-10,BECKETT>Or the rug belongs to his girlfriend,

627
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,300
<32-10,BECKETT>让他先暂存在储藏室
<32-10,BECKETT>who asked him to keep it in storage

628
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,790
<32-10,BECKETT>等她有空了再来取回去
<32-10,BECKETT>until she's ready to pick it up.

629
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,140
<32-10,BECKETT>好吧
<32-10,BECKETT>All right.

630
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,720
<32-11,CASTLE>那你对漂白剂和油漆又作何解释
<32-11,CASTLE>Then explain the bleach, the paint.

631
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,350
<32-11,CASTLE>而且我无意听到他说
<32-11,CASTLE>And I overheard him say,

632
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,180
<32-11,CASTLE>"我不能把它永远放在那里"
<32-11,CASTLE>"I can't keep it there forever."

633
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,890
<32-12,ALEXIS>老爸  快来看  有人来了
<32-12,ALEXIS>Dad, look. Someone's coming.

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,710
<32-13,CASTLE>他就是那个奸夫
<32-13,CASTLE>That's the guy she was having an affair with.

<32-13,CASTLE>他来找她  他想知道她去哪儿了
<32-13,CASTLE>He's looking for her. He wants to know where she is.

637
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,210
<32-14,CASTLE>要是你现在去  你就能抓到他
<32-14,CASTLE>If you leave now, you can catch him.

638
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,290
<32-14,CASTLE>你可以向他询问她的下落
<32-14,CASTLE>You can ask him where she is.

<32-16,CASTLE>who broke them up,

643
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,660

649
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,510
<34-1,BECKETT>但一直没收到回复
<34-1,BECKETT>but so far there's been no response.

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,590
<34-2,ALEXIS>她父母那里呢
<34-2,ALEXIS>What about her parents?

00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,590
<34-3,BECKETT>他们也没有她的消息
<34-3,BECKETT>but they haven't heard from her either.

<34-4,CASTLE>所以我不是个吃药吃昏脑袋的疯子咯
<34-4,CASTLE>So I'm not a drug-addled crazy?

<34-5,BECKETT>听着  我知道这听上去很可疑
<34-5,BECKETT>Look, I know it sounds suspicious,

655
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,900
<34-5,BECKETT>可是没有发现尸体  也没有人口失踪报告
<34-5,BECKETT>but without a body or a missing person's report,

656
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,260
<34-5,BECKETT>我没有线索继续追查下去
<34-5,BECKETT>I've got nothing to go on.

657
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,300
<34-6,CASTLE>你在等着出现线索继续追查的时候
<34-6,CASTLE>Well, while you're waiting for something to go on,

658
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,930
<34-6,CASTLE>他早把大部分的证据都销毁了
<34-6,CASTLE>he's already taken most of the evidence away.

659
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,940
<34-6,CASTLE>幸运的是  我知道他是怎么
<34-6,CASTLE>But luckily, I know what he's done with--

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,180
<34-7,BECKETT>你是要让我去非法搜查吗
<34-7,BECKETT>You're talking about an illegal search.

663
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,980
<34-8,CASTLE>要是你做  那就是非法搜查
<34-8,CASTLE>When you do it, it's an illegal search.

664
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,810
<34-8,CASTLE>我做  就只是犯法活动
<34-8,CASTLE>When I do it, it's just illegal.

665
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,560
<35-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这个主意太烂了
<35-1,BECKETT>Castle, this is such a bad idea.

666
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,020
<35-1,BECKETT>不对  是聪明的主意
<35-1,BECKETT>No, this is a brilliant idea.

668
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,000
<35-2,CASTLE>然后我打电话给楼下前台
<35-2,CASTLE>Then I call downstairs to the front desk,

669
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,620
<35-2,CASTLE>告诉他们锁被切断了
<35-2,CASTLE>tell them that the lock has been cut.

670
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,920
<35-2,CASTLE>当他们来查看情况时
<35-2,CASTLE>When they come up to see if everything's okay,

671
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,220
<35-2,CASTLE>他们发现尸体就会报警
<35-2,CASTLE>they find the body they call the police,

672
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,540
<35-2,CASTLE>你就有正当的理由了
<35-2,CASTLE>and you have probable cause.

673
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,780
<35-2,CASTLE>你只要乖乖站在走廊里
<35-2,CASTLE>If you stay out here in the hallway,

674
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,700
<35-2,CASTLE>就不会侵犯任何人的权利

<36-10,GATES>对了  卡塞尔先生
<36-10,GATES>Oh, and, Mr. Castle,

707
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,330
<36-10,GATES>你的邻居说了  要是你再去打扰他
<36-10,GATES>your neighbor did say that if you bother him in any way,

708
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,150
<36-10,GATES>他就要告你
<36-10,GATES>he will press charges.

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,950
<36-10,GATES>卡塞尔
<36-10,GATES>Hey, Castle.

711
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,810
<37-1,ESPOSITO>刚刚被骂得屁滚尿流
<37-1,ESPOSITO>Is it hard to balance on those crutches

712
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,510
<37-1,ESPOSITO>现在是不是拐杖也拿不稳了啊
<37-1,ESPOSITO>when you've just had your ass chewed off?

713
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,140
<37-2,CASTLE>我在车里等你
<37-2,CASTLE>I'll be in the car.

714
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,190
<37-3,BECKETT>二位笑星在死者丈夫那边有新发现吗
<37-3,BECKETT>Did you two comedians find out anything new on the husband?

715
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
<37-4,ESPOSITO>他的通话记录没什么不正常
<37-4,ESPOSITO>Well, there was nothing unusual in his phone

716
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,610
<37-4,ESPOSITO>经济状况也没问题
<37-4,ESPOSITO>or financial records.

717
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,750
<37-5,RYAN>我们找店里所有人谈过
<37-5,RYAN>And we talked to everyone at the store.

718
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,810
<37-5,RYAN>他们都说他整晚都在
<37-5,RYAN>They said he was there all night.

719
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,730
<37-5,RYAN>但他们确实提到他行为异常
<37-5,RYAN>But they did say that he was acting weird.

720
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,830
<37-6,BECKETT>怎么异常
<37-6,BECKETT>Weird how?

721
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,090
<37-7,RYAN>他平时上晚班都窝在办公室里
<37-7,RYAN>Well, normally on a late shift, he holes up in his office.

722
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,590
<37-7,RYAN>但那晚  他整晚都在外面
<37-7,RYAN>But that night, he spent all his time on the floor.

723
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,790
<37-8,BECKETT>他故意让人看见  好有不在场证明
<37-8,BECKETT>He wanted to be seen 'cause he needed an alibi.

724
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,040
<37-8,BECKETT>那家伙肯定涉案了
<37-8,BECKETT>That guy is involved.

725
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,960
<37-9,ESPOSITO>你的推测很有理  可问题是
<37-9,ESPOSITO>It's a great theory. There's only one problem.

726
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,360
<37-9,ESPOSITO>我们没有证据
<37-9,ESPOSITO>We have no proof.

727
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,740
<37-10,BECKETT>会有的
<37-10,BECKETT>Yet.

728
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,130
<38-1,CASTLE>我这人不常说这话
<38-1,CASTLE>Well, I don't say this often,

729
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,380
<38-1,CASTLE>但这回  对不起啦
<38-1,CASTLE>But... I'm sorry.

732
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,620
<38-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没关系
<38-2,BECKETT>You know what, Castle? It's okay.

733
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,060
<38-2,BECKETT>你过于活跃的想象力
<38-2,BECKETT>Your overactive imagination

734
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,440
<38-2,BECKETT>确实让许多人伏法
<38-2,BECKETT>has actually brought a lot of people to justice.

735
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,600
<38-2,BECKETT>其实  那也正是我喜欢你的地方之一
<38-2,BECKETT>In fact, it's one of the things that I love about you.

736
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,230
<38-2,BECKETT>哇
<38-2,BECKETT>Wow.

737

<41-14,BECKETT>困在家里  不能查案子
<41-14,BECKETT>stuck at home with no case to solve.

816
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,840
<41-14,BECKETT>然后我看到这间房子在招租
<41-14,BECKETT>And I saw that this apartment was for rent,

817
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,480
<41-14,BECKETT>我就  我以为
<41-14,BECKETT>And I just-- I thought that I--

818
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,070
<41-15,MARTHA>理查德

00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,640
<41-16,CASTLE>不
<41-16,CASTLE>No.

821
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,930
<41-16,CASTLE>这真是
<41-16,CASTLE>This is...

822
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,690
<41-16,CASTLE>毫无疑问
<41-16,CASTLE>without a doubt...

823
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,850
<41-16,CASTLE>我这辈子最好的生日礼物
<41-16,CASTLE>the greatest birthday gift of my life!

<41-17,CASTLE>How did you do it?

825
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,310
<41-18,BECKETT>我找了很多人帮忙
<41-18,BECKETT>Well, I did have a lot of help.

826
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,180
<41-19,MARTHA>是啊  好多人帮呢
<41-19,MARTHA>Yes, you did, indeed.

<41-20,CASTLE>你们都参与了
<41-20,CASTLE>You were all in on out?

828

<41-21,MARTHA>I, of course, was the director.

831
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,520
<41-22,CASTLE>你俩呢
<41-22,CASTLE>And the boys?

<41-24,BECKETT>-没错  -他俩棒极了
<41-24,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Oh, yeah. They were great.

833
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,570
<41-24,BECKETT>不过你们根本不用把门踢坏了
<41-24,BECKETT>Except you didn't have to kick down the door.

834
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,930
<41-26,RYAN>-我太入戏了  -我们想逼真一点
<41-26,RYAN>- I was in the moment. - We wanted to be convincing.

<41-29,ALEXIS>所以我才给你买望远镜了
<41-29,ALEXIS>It's why I bought you the binoculars.

837
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,090
<41-30,CASTLE>甚至还有盖茨警监
<41-30,CASTLE>Even Captain Gates?

838
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,410
<41-31,RYAN>是啊  她会抓住一切
<41-31,RYAN>Yeah, she jumped at the chance

839
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,870
<41-31,RYAN>把你臭骂一顿的机会
<41-31,RYAN>to dress you down for any reason.

840
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,430
<41-32,CASTLE>盖茨警监人呢
<41-32,CASTLE>Where is Captain Gates?

841
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,010
<41-33,ESPOSITO>-她来不了  -真好
<41-33,ESPOSITO>- She couldn't make it. - Good.

842
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,840
<41-36,MICHAEL>太好了
<41-36,MICHAEL>All right!

843
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,230
<41-37,CASTLE>你真是让我大吃一惊
<41-37,CASTLE>You really blew my mind.

844
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,830
<41-38,BECKETT>好吧  我觉得最难的一点
<41-38,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I figured the trickiest part

845
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,810
<41-38,BECKETT>就是耍你的同时
<41-38,BECKETT>would be fooling you and...

846
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,100
<41-38,BECKETT>还得保持严肃的表情
<41-38,BECKETT>keep a straight face.

847
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,750
<41-39,CASTLE>行了  恭喜你荣获奥斯卡
<41-39,CASTLE>Well, you win the Oscar for

848
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,650
<41-39,CASTLE>最佳假谋杀奖
<41-39,CASTLE>best pretend murder.

849
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,670
<41-39,CASTLE>我都不相信这一切都是演出来的
<41-39,CASTLE>I cannot believe the whole thing was staged.

850
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,670
<41-40,BECKETT>演出来的
<41-40,BECKETT>Staged?

851
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,120
<41-41,CASTLE>怎么了
<41-41,CASTLE>What?

852
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,930
<41-42,BECKETT>我觉得我把案子破了
<41-42,BECKETT>I think I just solved my case.

853
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,450
<41-43,CASTLE>也就是说你下一步就要跑掉
<41-43,CASTLE>Does that mean you're gonna have to go run off

854
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,080
<41-43,CASTLE>去抓坏人了
<41-43,CASTLE>and arrest someone?

855
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,100
<41-43,CASTLE>不
<41-43,CASTLE>No.

856
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,530
<41-44,BECKETT>现在我还有其他安排
<41-44,BECKETT>Right now I've got other plans.

857
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,730
<41-44,BECKETT>生日快乐
<41-44,BECKETT>Happy birthday.

858
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,730
<42-1,BECKETT>听着  我很抱歉把你找来
<42-1,BECKETT>Look, I'm sorry I had to drag you down here,

859
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,590
<42-1,BECKETT>但我觉得你掌握着破案的关键信息
<42-1,BECKETT>but I think you might actually hold the key to solving this murder.

860
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,430
<42-2,RIGAS>没问题  但是我把知道的都告诉你了
<42-2,RIGAS>Sure, but I already told you what I know.

861
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:47,770
<42-3,BECKETT>对  你说你在监控录像上发现了谋杀案
<42-3,BECKETT>Right, that you spotted the murder being committed on surveillance,

862
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:48,790
<42-3,BECKETT>然后你就打了911
<42-3,BECKETT>and then you called 9-1-1.

863
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,850
<42-4,RIGAS>是的
<42-4,RIGAS>That's correct.

864
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,540
<42-5,BECKETT>我看了这录像好几次了
<42-5,BECKETT>See, I've looked at this video dozens of times,

865
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,050
<42-5,BECKETT>想看看我能不能找到线索
<42-5,BECKETT>trying to see if I could find a clue

866
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,530
<42-5,BECKETT>查出凶手是谁
<42-5,BECKETT>as to who the murderer was.

867
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:00,680
<42-5,BECKETT>然后我就发现我找错了地方
<42-5,BECKETT>And then I realized, I'm looking in the wrong place.

868
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,000
<42-5,BECKETT>你看到那里了吗
<42-5,BECKETT>Do you see that?

869
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,730
<42-6,RIGAS>看到什么
<42-6,RIGAS>See what?

870
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,930
<42-7,BECKETT>要发现它确实有点难
<42-7,BECKETT>I-it's actually kind of hard to spot.

871
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,110
<42-7,BECKETT>就是这里的小点
<42-7,BECKETT>that dot right there.

872
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,660
<42-7,BECKETT>就是这个不知怎么神奇地
<42-7,BECKETT>It's graffiti that somehow magically

873
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,650
<42-7,BECKETT>出现在墙上的涂鸦
<42-7,BECKETT>appears on that wall.

874
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,270
<42-7,BECKETT>看好了
<42-7,BECKETT>Here.

875
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,050
<42-7,BECKETT>我再给你放一次
<42-7,BECKETT>I'll play it for you again.

876
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,340
<42-8,BECKETT>那怎么可能
<42-8,BECKETT>How is that possible?

877
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,660
<42-9,RIGAS>我也不知道
<42-9,RIGAS>I don't know.

878
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,090
<42-10,BECKETT>唯一的可能的就是
<42-10,BECKETT>The only way that it's possible

879
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,250
<42-10,BECKETT>有人修改了画面
<42-10,BECKETT>is if someone tampered with the feed

880
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,630
<42-10,BECKETT>用早前录好的影像
<42-10,BECKETT>and replaced the live image

881
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,760
<42-10,BECKETT>替换掉了当时的实时录像
<42-10,BECKETT>with footage that was recorded before that tag was made.

882
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,390
<42-11,RIGAS>那不可能  除非有人
<42-11,RIGAS>That would be impossible unless somebody--

883
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,240
<42-12,BECKETT>有权限进入监控系统
<42-12,BECKETT>Had access to the surveillance system,

884
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,960
<42-12,BECKETT>而你刚好有
<42-12,BECKETT>which you have.

885
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,530
<42-12,BECKETT>如果这确实是先录好的影像
<42-12,BECKETT>And if that is indeed a prerecorded image,

886
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,350
<42-12,BECKETT>那就意味这袭击是假的
<42-12,BECKETT>then that means that the attack was faked.

887
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,540
<42-12,BECKETT>而那个先被打死
<42-12,BECKETT>And that woman that is being beaten

888
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,980
<42-12,BECKETT>然后扔进垃圾桶的女人
<42-12,BECKETT>and then thrown into the dumpster

889
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,000
<42-12,BECKETT>并不是真正的德温特太太
<42-12,BECKETT>in not the real Mrs. DeWinter.

890
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,420
<42-12,BECKETT>你发现她从没露出过脸吗
<42-12,BECKETT>Now do you notice that she never actually shows her face?

891
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,320
<42-12,BECKETT>就好像是有个和她身材相当人
<42-12,BECKETT>It's almost as if someone is pretending to be her,

892
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,830
<42-12,BECKETT>在假扮她一样
<42-12,BECKETT>someone with the same frame,

893
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,970
<42-12,BECKETT>那个人和你很像
<42-12,BECKETT>Someone a lot like you.

894
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,020
<42-13,RIGAS>那不是我
<42-13,RIGAS>That is not me.

895
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,620
<42-14,BECKETT>我猜真正的德温特太太
<42-14,BECKETT>I'm guessing that real Mrs. DeWinter.

896
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,730
<42-14,BECKETT>是当晚早些时候在别处遇害的
<42-14,BECKETT>was killed somewhere else earlier in the evening,

897
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,720
<42-14,BECKETT>然后凶手把她的尸体放到了垃圾桶里
<42-14,BECKETT>and that the killer planted her body in the dumpster

898
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,130
<42-14,BECKETT>好让你和你的同事
<42-14,BECKETT>so that it would be there

899
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,100
<42-14,BECKETT>在观看假录像的时候发现她
<42-14,BECKETT>when you and your colleagues viewed the faked footage.

900
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,290
<42-14,BECKETT>而那个录像就成了完美的不在场证明
<42-14,BECKETT>That video is the perfect alibi for the murder.

901
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,320
<42-15,RIGAS>我都不认识德温特太太
<42-15,RIGAS>I didn't even know Mrs. DeWinter.

902
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,400
<42-16,BECKETT>是  但是你认识她的丈夫
<42-16,BECKETT>No, but you do know her husband.

903
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,940
<42-16,BECKETT>根据你的人事资料
<42-16,BECKETT>According to your personnel file,

904
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,180
<42-16,BECKETT>你几年前在皇后区的一家超市
<42-16,BECKETT>you worked night security

905
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,030
<42-16,BECKETT>担任夜间安保
<42-16,BECKETT>at a supermarket in Queens a year ago.

906
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,020
<42-16,BECKETT>和德温特先生在一家超市
<42-16,BECKETT>That is the same store as Mr. DeWinter.

907
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,500
<42-17,RIGAS>那只是个巧合
<42-17,RIGAS>That's just a coincidence.

908
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,990
<42-18,BECKETT>那你一周前租了一辆CLS550也是巧合吗
<42-18,BECKETT>Is it also a coincidence that you rented a CLS550 a week ago?

909
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,850
<42-19,RIGAS>我没有杀她
<42-19,RIGAS>I didn't kill her.

910
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,250
<42-20,BECKETT>我知道不是你
<42-20,BECKETT>I know you didn't.

911
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,150
<42-20,BECKETT>我需要你告诉我是谁
<42-20,BECKETT>I need you to tell me who did.

912
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,320
<43-1,BECKETT>他们一年前值夜班的时候认识的
<43-1,BECKETT>They met a year ago on the late shift

913
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,020
<43-1,BECKETT>然后就开始了婚外情
<43-1,BECKETT>and started an affair.

914
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,350
<43-1,BECKETT>他们一在一起
<43-1,BECKETT>Once they got together,

915
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,390
<43-1,BECKETT>加文就意识到他必须摆脱他老婆
<43-1,BECKETT>Gavin realized that he'd have to get rid of his wife,

916
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,300
<43-1,BECKETT>他没有选择麻烦的离婚
<43-1,BECKETT>And instead of a messy divorce,

917
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,500
<43-1,BECKETT>而是决定杀人灭口
<43-1,BECKETT>they decided to make a killing.

918
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,440
<43-2,ESPOSITO>真是"了不起"的婚姻
<43-2,ESPOSITO>Some marriage.

919
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,900
<43-2,ESPOSITO>难怪克莱拉想要消失
<43-2,ESPOSITO>No wonder Clara wanted to disappear.

920
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,730
<43-3,BECKETT>是啊  但她还是不够快
<43-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but she didn't do it fast enough.

921
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,650
<43-4,RYAN>那真正的谋杀地点在哪
<43-4,RYAN>So where's the actual murder take place?

922
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,040
<43-4,RYAN>在德温特家的车库里
<43-4,RYAN>In the DeWinters' garage.

923
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,340
<43-5,BECKETT>吃完晚饭  他就用
<43-5,BECKETT>After dinner, he bludgeoned her to death

924
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,950
<43-5,BECKETT>放在过道的棒球棍把她打死了
<43-5,BECKETT>with the bat that he left in the alleyway,

925
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,810
<43-5,BECKETT>然后给她换好瑞嘉丝
<43-5,BECKETT>and then he changed her into the clothes

926
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,260
<43-5,BECKETT>在录像里穿的衣服
<43-5,BECKETT>that Rigas wore on that tape.

927
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,720
<43-5,BECKETT>在他把尸体放在垃圾桶之前
<43-5,BECKETT>And then just before placing her body in the dumpster,
