28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,980
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>贝克特
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Beckett!

29
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,480
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔  我在这儿
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>Castle, I'm here!

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,760
<1-3,CASTLE>贝克特  坚持住
<1-3,CASTLE>Beckett, hang on!

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,510
<1-3,CASTLE>要么是我在做一个无聊透顶的梦
<1-3,CASTLE>Either this is the most boring dream I've ever had

33
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,970
<2-1,CASTLE>要么是你也睡不着
<2-1,CASTLE>or you can't sleep either.

34
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,640
<2-2,ALEXIS>不是做梦  噩梦还差不多
<2-2,ALEXIS>It's not a dream. More like a nightmare.

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,500
<2-3,CASTLE>在烦毕业生代表演讲的事吗
<2-3,CASTLE>Is this about your valedictorian speech?

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,310
<2-4,ALEXIS>我终于有机会说点重要的事
<2-4,ALEXIS>It's my chance to say something important,

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,590
<2-4,ALEXIS>有意义的事
<2-4,ALEXIS>something worthy.

38
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,530
<2-4,ALEXIS>我不想搞砸了
<2-4,ALEXIS>I don't want to blow it,

39
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,310
<2-4,ALEXIS>但我又觉得没什么可说的
<2-4,ALEXIS>But I feel like I have nothing to say.

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,470
<2-5,CASTLE>你是在跟
<2-5,CASTLE>You mean nothing compared to

41
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,150
<2-5,CASTLE>人类的宗教经文
<2-5,CASTLE>the great sacred texts of mankind

42
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,520
<2-5,CASTLE>温斯顿·丘吉尔在哈罗公学的演讲
<2-5,CASTLE>or Winston Churchill's speech to Harrows,

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,320
<2-5,CASTLE>或者乔布斯在斯坦福的演讲相比吗
<2-5,CASTLE>or Steve Jobs' address to stanford?

44
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,870
<2-5,CASTLE>也许你应该找些平常一点的
<2-5,CASTLE>You know, maybe you should pick some speeches

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,360
<2-5,CASTLE>演讲来做参照
<2-5,CASTLE>that is a little less daunting to compare yours to,

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,420
<2-5,CASTLE>比如《情到深处》或者《暮光之城》
<2-5,CASTLE>like, um, "Say anything" or "Twilight."

48
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,100
<2-6,ALEXIS>不应该这么难的啊
<2-6,ALEXIS>It's not supposed to be this hard.

49
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,010
<2-7,CASTLE>生命中最有价值的东西
<2-7,CASTLE>You know, the most worthwhile things in life

50
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,100
<2-7,CASTLE>往往最难得到
<2-7,CASTLE>are often the most difficult.

51
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,160
<2-7,CASTLE>比如说
<2-7,CASTLE>For example--

53
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,750
<2-7,CASTLE>这手机真够智能的
<2-7,CASTLE>Wow. That really is a smart phone.

54
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,720
<3-1,BECKETT>你当然不明白
<3-1,BECKETT>Of course you don't understand

55
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,100
<3-1,BECKETT>为什么她这么重视毕业演讲
<3-1,BECKETT>why she's taking her graduation speech so seriously.

56
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,250
<3-1,BECKETT>你很可能是那种长袍底下
<3-1,BECKETT>You were probably the guy who had nothing on but boxers

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,510
<3-2,CASTLE>就穿了内裤的人
<3-2,CASTLE>underneath his gown.

58
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,910
<3-2,CASTLE>太瞧不起人了
<3-2,CASTLE>That is so insulting.

59
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,670
<3-2,CASTLE>不怕告诉你  我下面什么都不穿
<3-2,CASTLE>If you must know, I was naked underneath.

60
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,730
<3-3,BECKETT>不好意思  算我错了
<3-3,BECKETT>Oh, I'm sorry. I stand corrected.

61
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,010
<3-4,BECKETT>毕业生的爸爸有什么感想啊
<3-4,BECKETT>So how is the father of the graduate taking it?

62
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,660
<3-5,CASTLE>我已经计划好如何消愁了
<3-5,CASTLE>I already have a plan to drown my sorrows.

63
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,270
<3-5,CASTLE>典礼结束后  我妈去汉普顿
<3-5,CASTLE>After the ceremony, my mother goes off to the Hamptons,

64
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,960
<3-5,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯肯定是通宵有活动
<3-5,CASTLE>Alexis will be doing her all-nighter.

65
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,170
<3-5,CASTLE>我就连看《喋血双雄》和《毒手神探》
<3-5,CASTLE>I will be distracting myself with a double feature

66
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,140
<3-5,CASTLE>来转移下伤感情绪
<3-5,CASTLE>of "The killer" and "Hard boiled."

68
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,170
<3-6,BECKETT>这倒真算得上连看了
<3-6,BECKETT>Wow. That is a double feature.

69
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,350
<3-7,CASTLE>你也喜欢吴宇森吗
<3-7,CASTLE>You like John Woo?

70
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
<3-8,BECKETT>越血腥越好
<3-8,BECKETT>The bloodier the better.

71
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,210
<3-9,CASTLE>你想和我一块看吗
<3-9,CASTLE>You wouldn't want to... join me, would you?

72
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,720
<3-10,BECKETT>事实上  我很愿意
<3-10,BECKETT>Actually, I'd love to.

73
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,290
<3-11,BECKETT>走不走啊  卡塞尔
<3-11,BECKETT>You coming, Castle?

74
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,570
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这就来
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yeah. Please.

75
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,240
<4-2,BECKETT>什么情况
<4-2,BECKETT>So?

76
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,970
<4-3,ESPOSITO>死者是西班牙裔男性  快30岁
<4-3,ESPOSITO>So we've got a hispanic male, late 20s.

77
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,530
<4-3,ESPOSITO>出租车司机大约一小时前发现尸体
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Cabbie spotted the body about an hour ago

78
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,610
<4-3,ESPOSITO>然后报警
<4-3,ESPOSITO>and called it in.

79
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,880
<4-4,BECKETT>知道他身份吗
<4-4,BECKETT>We got an I.D.?

80
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,820
<4-5,ESPOSITO>不知道  找过死者口袋
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Nah. We checked his pockets.

81
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,460
<4-5,ESPOSITO>没手机  没钥匙  没钱包
<4-5,ESPOSITO>There's no phone, keys, or wallet.

82
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,360
<4-5,ESPOSITO>现在正在检查指纹
<4-5,ESPOSITO>And we're checking prints right now.

83
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,980
<4-5,ESPOSITO>从血迹来看  应该是走进巷子之前
<4-5,ESPOSITO>From the blood trail, it looks like he was shot

84
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,340
<4-5,ESPOSITO>就中枪了
<4-5,ESPOSITO>before he entered the alley.

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,210
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>他肩部的伤
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>He was hit in the shoulder

86
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,490
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>枪口径应为357
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>with what looks like a 357,

87
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,970
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>但致命枪是一支9毫米射出的
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>but the kill shot-- point-blank, execution style,

88
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,550
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>近距离处决式射击
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>with a 9 millimeter.

89
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,130
<4-7,CASTLE>两把枪  可能凶手不止一个
<4-7,CASTLE>Two guns. Could be more than one shooter.

90
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,360
<4-8,BECKETT>鉴证组能追踪到第一枪留下
<4-8,BECKETT>Was C.S.U. able to trace that blood trail

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
<4-8,BECKETT>的血迹吗
<4-8,BECKETT>from the first shot?

92
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,010
<4-9,ESPOSITO>从转角处开始的
<4-9,ESPOSITO>It starts around the corner.

93
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,470
<4-9,ESPOSITO>现在还看不到源点
<4-9,ESPOSITO>There's no visible point of origin,

94
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,970
<4-9,ESPOSITO>不过鉴证组的人还在找
<4-9,ESPOSITO>but the teams are still looking.

95
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,640
<4-10,BECKETT>这附近可不怎么太平
<4-10,BECKETT>Well, this is a bad neighborhood.

96
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,490
<4-10,BECKETT>是不是抢劫出了岔子
<4-10,BECKETT>Maybe it was a mugging gone wrong?

97
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,280
<4-10,BECKETT>有可能
<4-10,BECKETT>Maybe.

98
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,160
<4-11,LANIE>从他肩膀上的细槽看
<4-11,LANIE>These grooves in his shoulder indicate

99
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,420
<4-11,LANIE>他当时扛着很重的东西
<4-11,LANIE>that he was carrying something, and it was heavy.

100
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,270
<4-11,LANIE>至少14公斤
<4-11,LANIE>I'd say at least 30 pounds.

101
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,530
<4-11,LANIE>他手指甲里好像有些皮肤组织
<4-11,LANIE>I'm even seeing traces of skin tissue in his fingernail.

102
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,880
<4-11,LANIE>没准能验到DNA
<4-11,LANIE>I may be able to get D.N.A.,

103
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,250
<4-11,LANIE>等把他运回停尸间我就能进一步尸检了
<4-11,LANIE>But I'll know a lot more once I get him back to the morgue.

104
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,090
<4-12,CASTLE>他口袋可能是空的
<4-12,CASTLE>Uh, his pockets may have been empty,

105
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,310
<4-12,CASTLE>不过他貌似在鞋里面藏了什么东西
<4-12,CASTLE>but it looks like he was trying to hide something in his shoe.

106
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,910
<4-13,BECKETT>锁镐
<4-13,BECKETT>Lock picks?

107
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,110
<4-14,CASTLE>什么人会随身带着锁镐呢
<4-14,CASTLE>Now why would someone be needing lock picks?

108
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,650
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>他是个小偷
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>He's a thief.

109
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,120
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>奥兰多·科斯塔斯
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>Orlando Costas.

110
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,390
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>几次入室抢劫  涉嫌的抢劫案一堆
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>A couple of domestic B&Es, but suspected of a dozen more.

111
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,010
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>他曾是卡扎多斯帮的人
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>He used to run with the Cazadores.

112
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,840
<5-2,CASTLE>卡扎多斯帮是什么
<5-2,CASTLE>Cazadores?

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,690
<5-3,RYAN>一个贩卖毒品和武器  兼盗窃的街头帮派
<5-3,RYAN>They're a violent street gang that deals in drugs, arms, and larceny,

114
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,250
<5-3,RYAN>但他的前科都是少年时的事了
<5-3,RYAN>But all of Orlando's priors are back when he was a teenager.

115
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,490
<5-3,RYAN>他已经多年没犯过事了
<5-3,RYAN>He hasn't been arrested in years.

116
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,510
<5-4,CASTLE>也许他又重出江湖了
<5-4,CASTLE>Maybe he got back in the game.

117
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,520
<5-5,RYAN>不好说  他为改邪归正下了不少功夫
<5-5,RYAN>I don't know. He went a long way to clean up his act.

118
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,270
<5-5,RYAN>当了四年兵
<5-5,RYAN>Did four years active in the military,

119
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,080
<5-5,RYAN>去年光荣退伍
<5-5,RYAN>discharged with honors last year.

120
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,530
<5-5,RYAN>轮岗时去了德国做宪兵
<5-5,RYAN>Spent his rotation as an M.P. in Germany.

121
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,230
<5-6,CASTLE>宪兵  他还真的改邪归正了
<5-6,CASTLE>Military police? He really did clean up his act.

122
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,360
<5-7,RYAN>若这家伙已经改过自新了
<5-7,RYAN>If this guy went straight,

123
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,350
<5-8,BECKETT>那怎么会死在小巷里
<5-8,BECKETT>then how did he end up dead in an alley?

124
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,940
<5-8,BECKETT>查过近亲了吗
<5-8,BECKETT>Did you check for next of kin?

125
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,040
<5-9,RYAN>他家人都过世了
<5-9,RYAN>Uh, his folks are dead,

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,840
<5-9,RYAN>不过我们找到了他的女朋友玛丽萨尔·卡斯塔内塔
<5-9,RYAN>but we managed to track down a girlfriend-- Marisol Castaneda.

127
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,530
<5-9,RYAN>埃斯波西托现在正带她过来
<5-9,RYAN>Esposito's bringing her in right now.

128
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,370
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>我只知道  昨晚我上床睡觉的时候
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>All I know is, he was with me in bed last night

129
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,320
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>他还和我在一起的
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>when I went to sleep.

130
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,440
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>今早我醒来的时候
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>I woke up this morning,

131
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,420
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>他和我的车都不见了
<6-1,MARISOL CARTAGENA>and both him and my car were gone.

132
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,280
<6-2,BECKETT>他去哪了
<6-2,BECKETT>Where did he go?

133
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,010
<6-3,MARISOL>我以为他去就业中心看工作招聘了
<6-3,MARISOL>I figured he'd gone to the career center to check the job listings.

134
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,900
<6-3,MARISOL>他每天早上都这样
<6-3,MARISOL>He does that every morning.

135
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,450
<6-4,CASTLE>他在找工作
<6-4,CASTLE>He'd been looking for work?

136
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,390
<6-5,MARISOL>都几个月了
<6-5,MARISOL>For months.

137
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,610
<6-5,MARISOL>奥兰多曾为国效力
<6-5,MARISOL>Orlando served his country.

138
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,750
<6-5,MARISOL>你以为这事总算有点分量
<6-5,MARISOL>You'd think that means something,

139
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,310
<6-5,MARISOL>可我们生活很困难
<6-5,MARISOL>but it's been tough,

140
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,070
<6-5,MARISOL>尤其是我的工时还减少了
<6-5,MARISOL>especially after my hours got cut.

141
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,740
<6-6,BECKETT>也就是说他有财务压力
<6-6,BECKETT>So he was under financial pressure?

142
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,450
<6-6,BECKETT>有没有可能他又重操旧业了
<6-6,BECKETT>Is it possible that he went back to old habits?

143
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,180
<6-7,MARISOL>不可能
<6-7,MARISOL>No.

144
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,640
<6-8,BECKETT>玛丽萨尔  我们知道他曾是卡扎多斯的一员
<6-8,BECKETT>Look, Marisol, we know that he ran with the Cazadores.

145
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,210
<6-8,BECKETT>-你觉得  -我说了不可能
<6-8,BECKETT>- Do you think that-- - I said no.

146
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,380
<6-9,MARISOL>他为脱离过去那种生活付出了许多
<6-9,MARISOL>He went through hell to escape that life.

147
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,720
<6-9,MARISOL>去参军  就是为了摆脱过去
<6-9,MARISOL>It's why he enlisted, to get out,

148
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,750
<6-9,MARISOL>为我重新做人
<6-9,MARISOL>to be a better man for me...

149
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,060
<6-9,MARISOL>为我们的儿子重新做人
<6-9,MARISOL>a better father to our son.

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,550
<6-9,MARISOL>请你们不要再把这事当成是他的错
<6-9,MARISOL>So how about you stop trying to make this his fault

151
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,210
<6-9,MARISOL>去找杀他的凶手吧
<6-9,MARISOL>and find whoever killed him?

152
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,740
<6-10,BECKETT>你的车是什么样的
<6-10,BECKETT>What kind of car do you have?

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,570
<7-1,ESPOSITO>离小巷两个街区
<7-1,ESPOSITO>Two blocks away from the alley,

154
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,150
<7-1,ESPOSITO>靠手上有血  肯定是这辆车
<7-1,ESPOSITO>blood smeared on the arm rest-- this is definitely it.

155
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,330
<7-2,CASTLE>他在别处遭到枪击然后跑这来了
<7-2,CASTLE>He was shot somewhere else and then he came here?

156
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,180
<7-2,CASTLE>为什么不回家  为什么不去处理伤口
<7-2,CASTLE>Why not go home? Why not go get patched up?

157
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,020
<7-3,BECKETT>他在那条小巷里和人会面
<7-3,BECKETT>He was meeting someone in that alleyway.

158
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,010
<7-3,BECKETT>有部电话
<7-3,BECKETT>Phone.

159
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,270
<7-4,ESPOSITO>最后一通电话是凌晨4点47  就在他死前
<7-4,ESPOSITO>His last call was 4:47 a.m., just before he died.

160
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,710
<7-5,BECKETT>-查一下那个号码  -好的
<7-5,BECKETT>- Run that number. - Right.

161
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,390
<7-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特  有支枪
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Hey, Beckett, gun.

162
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,740
<7-7,RYAN>是38口径
<7-7,RYAN>It's a .38.

163
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,530
<7-7,RYAN>才开过火
<7-7,RYAN>Recently fired.

164
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,300
<7-8,CASTLE>那就是枪战了
<7-8,CASTLE>So it was a shootout.

165
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,660
<7-8,CASTLE>他的肩伤是这么来的
<7-8,CASTLE>That's how he got the shoulder wound.

166
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,040
<7-9,BECKETT>那么不管他从哪逃过来  可能还有人死了
<7-9,BECKETT>Which means, wherever he came from, there might be another body.

167
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,370
<7-10,ESPOSITO>我知道他从哪逃过来
<7-10,ESPOSITO>I know where he was coming from.

168
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:48,980
<7-11,CASTLE>哪里
<7-11,CASTLE>Where?

169
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,090
<7-12,ESPOSITO>最后行车记录显示为第一大道299号
<7-12,ESPOSITO>His last entry was 299 First Avenue.

170
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,960
<7-13,CASTLE>等等  第一大道299号是哪里
<7-13,CASTLE>Wait. What's at 299 First Ave.?

171
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,740
<7-14,BECKETT>蒙哥马利警监家
<7-14,BECKETT>Captain Montgomery's house.

172
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,100
<8-1,RYAN>真庆幸没人受伤
<8-1,RYAN>We're just thankful no one was hurt.

173
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,710
<8-2,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>相信我  我也是
<8-2,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>Believe me, so am I.

174
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,090
<8-2,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>罗伊去世之后
<8-2,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>Ever since Roy died,

175
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,790
<8-2,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>我晚上睡觉都把他的357口径放在床头柜里
<8-2,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>I've slept with his .357 in the nightstand.

176
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,010
<8-3,BECKETT>只有一个人吗
<8-3,BECKETT>So it was just the one guy?

177
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,360
<8-3,BECKETT>据我所知是的
<8-3,BECKETT>As far as I know.

178
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,780
<8-3,BECKETT>他当时正从柜子里拿文件出来
<8-3,BECKETT>He was taking files out of the cabinet.

179
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,050
<8-3,BECKETT>背包里还装了罗伊的旧笔记本电脑
<8-3,BECKETT>He had Roy's old laptop in his backpack.

180
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,300
<8-3,BECKETT>他看到我的时候  就拿出了武器
<8-3,BECKETT>When he saw me, he pulled his weapon,

181
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,330
<8-3,BECKETT>上帝保佑  我冲他开了枪
<8-3,BECKETT>so God help me, I shot him.

182
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,830
<7-1,ESPOSITO>我好像击中了他的肩膀
<7-1,ESPOSITO>I think I hit him in his shoulder.

183
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,270
<7-2,CASTLE>他开枪还击了  然后跳窗逃了
<7-2,CASTLE>He fired back, and then he crashed through the window.

184
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,930
<8-4,BECKETT>伊芙琳  是这人吗
<8-4,BECKETT>Evelyn, was this the guy?

185
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,740
<8-5,EVELYN>没错  就是他
<8-5,EVELYN>Yeah. That's him.

186
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,000
<8-6,CASTLE>幸好孩子们都不在家
<8-6,CASTLE>I'm glad Evan and the girls weren't home.

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,340
<8-7,EVELYN>说来有趣
<8-7,EVELYN>Funny thing is,

188
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,930
<8-7,EVELYN>我也不应该在家的
<8-7,EVELYN>I wasn't supposed to be home either.

189
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,820
<8-7,EVELYN>好像他知道我们不会在家似的
<8-7,EVELYN>It's almost like he knew we weren't supposed to be here.

190
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,710
<8-8,CASTLE>那些文件有什么特别的吗
<8-8,CASTLE>Anything special about those files?

191
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,110
<8-9,EVELYN>就是些文案  法律文件
<8-9,EVELYN>Just paperwork, legal documents,

192
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,690
<8-9,EVELYN>罗伊旧案子的笔记
<8-9,EVELYN>notes on Roy's old cases.

193
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,860
<8-10,ESPOSITO>他的电脑呢  里面有什么
<8-10,ESPOSITO>What about his computer? What-- what was on that?

194
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,010
<8-11,EVELYN>他以前的工作文件
<8-11,EVELYN>His old work files,

195
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,140
<8-11,EVELYN>不过我现在大多用来放圣诞卡和食谱
<8-11,EVELYN>but mostly, I use it for Christmas cards and recipes.

196
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,220
<9-1,ESPOSITO>他们是去找蒙哥马利那些文件的
<9-1,ESPOSITO>They went after Montgomery's files.

197
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,510
<9-1,ESPOSITO>不要贵重物品  也不要现金
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Not valuables, not cash.

198
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,510
<9-1,ESPOSITO>现在那个小偷死了
<9-1,ESPOSITO>And now our thief is dead

199
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,400
<9-1,ESPOSITO>而他偷走的文件下落不明
<9-1,ESPOSITO>and the files he took are missing?

200
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,430
<9-2,CASTLE>别这么急着下论断
<9-2,CASTLE>Well, let's not jump to conclusions.

201
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,660
<9-2,CASTLE>闯进蒙哥马利家
<9-2,CASTLE>为什么

202
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,050
<9-3,ESPOSITO>还会是什么情况
<9-3,ESPOSITO>What else would it be about?

203
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,340
<9-3,ESPOSITO>其他人都以为蒙哥马利是为
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Everyone here thinks Montgomery died

204
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,030
<9-3,ESPOSITO>将警察杀手绳之于法而殉职
<9-3,ESPOSITO>bringing a cop killer to justice.

205
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,650
<9-3,ESPOSITO>只有我们知道他到底趟了什么浑水
<9-3,ESPOSITO>We're the only ones who know what he was really involved in

206
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,180
<9-3,ESPOSITO>还有他和你妈妈那件凶杀案的关联
<9-3,ESPOSITO>and his connection to your mother's murder.

207
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,850
<9-3,ESPOSITO>贝克特  这不可能是巧合
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Beckett, it can't be a coincidence.

208
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,960
<9-4,BECKETT>再查一下死者的前科
<9-4,BECKETT>Recheck the vic's rap sheet.

209
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,150
<9-4,BECKETT>看看蒙哥马利有没有逮捕过他
<9-4,BECKETT>See if Montgomery was involved in any of his old arrests,

210
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,880
<9-4,BECKETT>去查那个号码
<9-4,BECKETT>and get on that number.

211
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,450
<9-4,BECKETT>我要知道他死前和谁通过电话
<9-4,BECKETT>I want to know who he was talking to just before he died.

212
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,230
<10-1,BECKETT>跟我说点安慰的话
<10-1,BECKETT>Say something reassuring.

213
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,970
<10-2,CASTLE>纽约市每年都有上千件入室行窃的案子
<10-2,CASTLE>There are thousands of break-ins in New York City every year.

214
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,930
<10-3,BECKETT>这件感觉不同
<10-3,BECKETT>This one feels different.

215
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,710
<10-4,CASTLE>那也不表示它就真的不同了
<10-4,CASTLE>Well, that doesn't mean that it is.

216
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,570
<10-4,CASTLE>蒙哥马利查过数百件案子
<10-4,CASTLE>Montgomery worked hundreds of cases.

217
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,940
<10-4,CASTLE>单凭这人在找文件
<10-4,CASTLE>Just because this guy was after files

218
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,620
<10-4,CASTLE>也不能确定就是在找你妈妈那件案子的
<10-4,CASTLE>doesn't mean he was after your mom's case.

219
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,580
<10-5,BECKETT>那这个小偷怎么会死
<10-5,BECKETT>Then why is our thief dead?

220
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,300
<10-5,BECKETT>你也知道和蒙哥马利跟谁搅在了一起
<10-5,BECKETT>You know those people that Montgomery was involved with,

221
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,360
<10-5,BECKETT>他说他们要我死
<10-5,BECKETT>he said that they wanted me dead,

222
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,060
<10-5,BECKETT>我离真相太近了
<10-5,BECKETT>that I was getting too close,

223
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,900
<10-5,BECKETT>还说他要用他的生命
<10-5,BECKETT>and he said that he was gonna give his life

224
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,190
<10-5,BECKETT>来保护我
<10-5,BECKETT>in order to protect mine,

225
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,750
<10-5,BECKETT>而他们却仍要杀我
<10-5,BECKETT>And they still tried to kill me.

226
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,020
<10-5,BECKETT>我有时醒来  问我自己
<10-5,BECKETT>I wake up sometimes, and I think to myself,

227
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,510
<10-5,BECKETT>我怎么还活着
<10-5,BECKETT>how the hell am I still alive?

228
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,660
<10-5,BECKETT>我就像是在等着出事
<10-5,BECKETT>It's like I'm just waiting for that other shoe to drop.

229
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,320
<10-5,BECKETT>如果我等的就是这个呢
<10-5,BECKETT>What if this is that other shoe?

245
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,750
<11-1,CASTLE>她的情况总算开始好转
<11-1,CASTLE>Things were finally getting better for her,

246
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,960
<11-1,CASTLE>我们之间也是
<11-1,CASTLE>for us.

247
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,640
<11-1,CASTLE>她刚刚开始敞开心扉
<11-1,CASTLE>She was just coming out of her shell,

248
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,850
<11-1,CASTLE>却又出这种事
<11-1,CASTLE>and now this?

249
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,270
<11-2,MARTHA RODGERS>你真觉得这跟她母亲的谋杀案有关吗
<11-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Do you really think it's related to her mother's murder case?

250
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,950
<11-3,CASTLE>希望没有
<11-3,CASTLE>I hope to god it isn't.

251
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,290
<11-3,CASTLE>蒙哥马利的朋友说得很清楚
<11-3,CASTLE>Montgomery's friend was very clear.

252
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,930
<11-3,CASTLE>她要是去查她妈妈的案子
<11-3,CASTLE>She starts poking around her mother's murder,

253
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,530
<11-3,CASTLE>他们会再次找上她
<11-3,CASTLE>they'll come after her again.

254
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,830
<11-3,CASTLE>我不能让这事发生
<11-3,CASTLE>I can't let that happen.

255
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,030
<11-4,MARTHA>我知道
<11-4,MARTHA>I know.

256
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:27,810
<12-1,BECKETT>谢谢
<12-1,BECKETT>Thank you.

257
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,980
<12-2,CASTLE>你睡觉了吗
<12-2,CASTLE>Did you get any sleep?

258
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,140
<12-3,BECKETT>没怎么睡
<12-3,BECKETT>Not much.

259
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,640
<12-4,CASTLE>死者调查有没有进展
<12-4,CASTLE>Anything new on our victim?

260
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,670
<12-5,BECKETT>我们重新查了奥兰多的前科
<12-5,BECKETT>We rechecked Orlando's rap sheet.

261
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,560
<12-5,BECKETT>蒙哥马利没有涉及任何他以前的案子
<12-5,BECKETT>Montgomery wasn't involved in any of his old arrests.

262
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,110
<12-5,BECKETT>入室行窃并非出于个人恩怨
<12-5,BECKETT>That break-in wasn't personal.

263
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
<12-6,CASTLE>他被害前打的那个电话呢
<12-6,CASTLE>What about the call he made before he was killed?

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,050
<12-7,BECKETT>对方用的是一次性手机  没有登记机主
<12-7,BECKETT>It's from a burner phone. There's no registered owner.

265
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,010
<12-8,CASTLE>你不是一个人
<12-8,CASTLE>You're not in this alone.

266
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,030
<12-10,CASTLE>有我呢
<12-10,CASTLE>I'm here.

267
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,870
<12-12,RYAN>我知道
<12-12,RYAN>I know.

268
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,170
<12-13,ESPOSITO>我们对入室行窃的动机可能猜错了
<12-13,ESPOSITO>We may have been wrong about why they hit Montgomery's.

269
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,720
<12-14,RYAN>几个证人称看到一名西班牙裔男子
<12-14,RYAN>Witnesses saw a Hispanic male fleeing the alley

270
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,710
<12-14,RYAN>开一辆褐色的帝威逃离巷子
<12-14,RYAN>in a late-model maroon Deville.

271
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,400
<12-14,RYAN>他脖子上有个帮派刺青
<12-14,RYAN>Apparently he had gang ink on his neck--

272
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,570
<12-14,RYAN>一头由字母C框着的狮子
<12-14,RYAN>a lion framed by a "C."

273
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,710
<12-14,RYAN>卡扎多斯帮
<12-14,RYAN>Cazador?

274
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,020
<12-16,ESPOSITO>也就是死者以前混过的帮派
<12-16,ESPOSITO>The very same gang that our victim ran with.

275
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
<12-17,BECKETT>帮派
<12-17,BECKETT>Gangs.

276
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,350
<12-18,ESPOSITO>如果这家伙确实去过巷子
<12-18,ESPOSITO>If this guy was in that alley,

277
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,300
<12-18,ESPOSITO>有可能是他杀了奥兰多
<12-18,ESPOSITO>odds are, he killed Orlando.

278
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,680
<12-19,BECKETT>有人看到车牌没
<12-19,BECKETT>Did we get a license plate?

279
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,790
<12-20,RYAN>没有  不过帮派专案组称
<12-20,RYAN>Uh, no, but according to gang task force,

280
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,870
<12-20,RYAN>一个叫文森特·德加多的人就开这车
<12-20,RYAN>the ride matches the car of one Vicente Delgado.

281
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,140
<12-20,RYAN>此人是卡扎多斯帮的头头
<12-20,RYAN>High-level shot caller for the Cazadores.

282
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,150
<12-20,RYAN>听这个
<12-20,RYAN>And get this.

283
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,560
<12-20,RYAN>他表兄蒂亚戈·古铁雷斯
<12-20,RYAN>His cousin Diego Gutierrez

284
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,450
<12-20,RYAN>在九五年因一起双尸案被蒙哥马利逮捕
<12-20,RYAN>was busted by Montgomery for a double homicide in '95.

285
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,710
<12-21,ESPOSITO>蒙哥马利死后一个月
<12-21,ESPOSITO>His lawyer's filed a motion for retrial

286
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,020
<12-21,ESPOSITO>其律师就提出了重审的上诉
<12-21,ESPOSITO>a month after Montgomery was killed.

287
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,300
<12-22,BECKETT>把他找来
<12-22,BECKETT>Find him.

288
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,100
<13-1,RYAN>纽约警局  双手都举起来
<13-1,RYAN>NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!

289
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,580
<13-2,ESPOSITO>不许动  不许动
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Don't move! Don't move! Don't move!

290
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,680
<13-1,RYAN>把手举起来
<13-1,RYAN>Let me see your hands!

291
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,830
<13-3,ESPOSITO>看呐
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Well, look here,

292
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,140
<13-3,ESPOSITO>九毫米口径
<13-3,ESPOSITO>a 9 millimeter.

293
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,110
<13-3,ESPOSITO>跟杀害奥兰多·科斯塔斯的枪一样
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Just like the gun that killed Orlando Costas.

294
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,320
<13-3,ESPOSITO>都说了  我根本没去过巷子
<13-3,ESPOSITO>I already told you, I was nowhere near that alley.

295
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,090
<14-1,DIEGO>你的目击证人肯定瞎了狗眼
<14-1,DIEGO>Fact is, your witnesses are blind.

296
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,120
<14-2,BECKETT>你认识奥兰多·科斯塔斯
<14-2,BECKETT>The fact is, you knew Orlando Costas.

297
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,130
<14-3,DIEGO>以前认识  后来他离帮了
<14-3,DIEGO>Yeah, I knew him once, before he turned his back.

298
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,410
<14-4,CASTLE>他最近一次联系你是什么时候
<14-4,CASTLE>When was the last time you heard from him.

299
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,980
<14-5,DIEGO>-多年前了  -几小时才对
<14-5,DIEGO>- Not in years. - Hours.

300
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,630
<14-6,BECKETT>他死前往一个一次性手机上打过电话
<14-6,BECKETT>Just before he was killed, Orlando called a burner cell,

301
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,110
<14-6,BECKETT>而这手机在你身上
<14-6,BECKETT>same phone that we found on you.

302
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,560
<14-6,BECKETT>老实交代吧  省去三十年的牢狱之灾
<14-6,BECKETT>So why don't you just admit to it and save yourself 30 years?

303
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,650
<14-6,BECKETT>是你让他闯入罗伊·蒙哥马利家
<14-6,BECKETT>You had him break in to Roy Montgomery's house

304
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,940
<14-6,BECKETT>把你表兄案子的文件偷出来
<14-6,BECKETT>and steal your cousin's case files,

305
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,310
<14-6,BECKETT>然后干掉了他
<14-6,BECKETT>and then you shot him.

306
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,770
<15-1,DIEGO>你有什么证据  小妞
<15-1,DIEGO>What you got, chica, huh?

307
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,170
<15-1,DIEGO>我的枪肯定对不上
<15-1,DIEGO>Gun's not gonna be a match.

308
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,230
<15-1,DIEGO>你也就只有一通电话
<15-1,DIEGO>So that leaves you with what, a phone call,

309
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,750
<15-1,DIEGO>几个声称看到一辆普通车子的证人
<15-1,DIEGO>and a couple of people who saw a very common car?

310
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,910
<15-1,DIEGO>知道你为什么没法给我定罪吗  小妞
<15-1,DIEGO>You know why you can't pin this on me, chica?

311
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,090
<16-1,DIEGO>我根本没去现场
<16-1,DIEGO>I wasn't there.

312
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,640
<16-2,BECKETT>不在个鬼
<16-2,BECKETT>The hell you weren't.

313
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,390
<16-2,BECKETT>这是弹道报告出来了
<16-2,BECKETT>That's gonna be ballistics.

314
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,320
<16-3,BECKETT>想做交易这是最后的机会
<16-3,BECKETT>Last chance to make a deal.

315
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,020
<16-3,BECKETT>准备起诉他私藏毒品和枪支
<16-3,BECKETT>Book him on the drugs and weapons charge

316
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,990
<17-1,BECKETT>告诉区检我要提出一级谋杀的罪名
<17-1,BECKETT>and tell the D.A. I'm gonna want to file for murder one.

317
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,370
<17-2,ESPOSITO>不是他干的
<17-2,ESPOSITO>It wasn't him.

318
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,120
<17-3,BECKETT>什么叫不是他干的
<17-3,BECKETT>What do you mean, it wasn't him?

319
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,940
<17-4,ESPOSITO>蕾妮从死者指甲里
<17-4,ESPOSITO>The skin tissue that Lanie was able to scrape

320
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,850
<17-4,ESPOSITO>刮出了一些皮肤组织
<17-4,ESPOSITO>from underneath our victim's fingernails,

321
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,660
<17-4,ESPOSITO>实验室做了DNA检验
<17-4,ESPOSITO>the lab was able to pull DNA.

322
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,240
<17-4,ESPOSITO>我们拿它跟文森特的比过了
<17-4,ESPOSITO>We ran it against Vicente.

323
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,570
<17-4,ESPOSITO>结果不符
<17-4,ESPOSITO>It's not a match.

324
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,380
<17-4,ESPOSITO>而且在整个系统都找不到匹配
<17-4,ESPOSITO>In fact, it wasn't a match to anyone in the system.

325
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,450
<17-5,RYAN>不过它跟另一个犯罪现场发现的DNA相符
<17-5,RYAN>But it did match DNA trace evidence found at another crime scene.

326
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,510
<17-6,CASTLE>至少还有线索  哪个犯罪现场
<17-6,CASTLE>Well, at least that's something. What was the crime scene?

327
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,660
<17-7,ESPOSITO>一起枪击案
<17-7,ESPOSITO>It was a shooting.

328
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,480
<17-8,RYAN>贝克特  是你那起枪击案
<17-8,RYAN>Beckett, it was your shooting.

329
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,530
<17-9,ESPOSITO>DNA检验结果确定
<17-9,ESPOSITO>DNA confirms that the man

330
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,980
<17-9,ESPOSITO>杀害奥兰多·科斯塔斯的凶手
<17-9,ESPOSITO>who killed Orlando Costas in that alley

331
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,440
<17-9,ESPOSITO>跟向你开枪的枪手是同一个人
<17-9,ESPOSITO>is the same man who put a bullet in your heart.

332
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,320
<18-1,BECKETT>11个月都没有线索  现在却出了这事
<18-1,BECKETT>No leads for 11 months, and now this.

333
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,070
<18-1,BECKETT>告诉盖茨了吗
<18-1,BECKETT>Does Gates know?

334
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,520
<18-2,ESPOSITO>还没
<18-2,ESPOSITO>No.

335
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,990
<18-3,BECKETT>那就不告诉她
<18-3,BECKETT>Then we don't tell her.

336
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,010
<18-3,BECKETT>如果她知道这跟我那个案子有关
<18-3,BECKETT>If she finds out this is a match to my shooting,

337
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,650
<18-3,BECKETT>她会把我踢出这个案子
<18-3,BECKETT>she'll take me off the case.

338
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,130
<18-4,CASTLE>或许你是不该插手此案
<18-4,CASTLE>Maybe you should be off this case.

339
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,640
<18-4,CASTLE>他们试图杀你  凯特
<18-4,CASTLE>They tried to kill you once, Kate.

340
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,450
<18-4,CASTLE>你继续追查  他们...
<18-4,CASTLE>You keep going on this, they...

341
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,570
<18-4,CASTLE>他们怎么会不再下杀手
<18-4,CASTLE>What's to stop them from trying again?

342
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,350
<18-5,BECKETT>他们现在为何不下杀手
<18-5,BECKETT>What's to stop them now?

343
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,910
<18-5,BECKETT>不行
<18-5,BECKETT>No.

344
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,790
<18-5,BECKETT>我已经为此等了一年了
<18-5,BECKETT>I've been waiting a year for this,

345
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,360
<18-5,BECKETT>我绝不会让别人把这事搞砸了
<18-5,BECKETT>and I'll be damned if I let someone else screw it up.

346
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,920
<18-6,RYAN>哈维尔
<18-6,RYAN>Hey, Javier.

347
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,390
<18-6,RYAN>伙计  这样不好吧
<18-6,RYAN>Man, this just feels wrong.

348
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,520
<18-6,RYAN>我们得告诉盖茨
<18-6,RYAN>We need to tell Gates.

349
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,420
<18-6,RYAN>告诉她干嘛
<18-6,RYAN>Why...

350
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,300
<18-7,ESPOSITO>让她把贝克特赶回家吗
<18-7,ESPOSITO>So she can send Beckett home?

351
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,670
<18-7,ESPOSITO>你认为这能行吗
<18-7,ESPOSITO>You think that's gonna work?

352
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,030
<18-7,ESPOSITO>你认为这能阻止她吗
<18-7,ESPOSITO>You think that's gonna stop her?

353
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,850
<18-7,ESPOSITO>凯文  不论如何
<18-7,ESPOSITO>She's gonna investigate this case, Kevin,

354
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,620
<18-7,ESPOSITO>她都会调查这个案子的
<18-7,ESPOSITO>whether she's on it or not.

355
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,520
<18-7,ESPOSITO>至少
<18-7,ESPOSITO>The least we can do

356
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,930
<18-7,ESPOSITO>要确保有我们罩着她
<18-7,ESPOSITO>is make sure that we have her back.

357
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:16,960
<19-1,CASTLE>你好
<19-1,CASTLE>Hello.

358
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,590
<19-1,CASTLE>你知道我找你什么事吧  卡塞尔先生
<19-1,CASTLE>I think you know why I'm calling, Mr. Castle.

359
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,960
<19-2,CASTLE>是你
<19-2,CASTLE>It's you.

360
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,760
<19-2,CASTLE>谢天谢地  到底怎么回事
<19-2,CASTLE>Thank god. What the hell is going on?

361
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,630
<19-2,CASTLE>为什么他们要闯进蒙哥马利家
<19-2,CASTLE>Why'd they break in to Montgomery's place?

362
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,050
<19-3,SMITH>最可能的就是去善后
<19-3,SMITH>Well, most likely, it's a clean-up job.

363
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,650
<19-3,SMITH>确保蒙哥马利的文件里
<19-3,SMITH>Making sure that Montgomery had nothing else

364
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,400
<19-3,SMITH>没有能定罪的东西
<19-3,SMITH>incriminating in his files.

365
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,390
<19-3,SMITH>只要贝克特放弃调查
<19-3,SMITH>As long as Beckett drops her investigation,

366
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,600
<19-3,SMITH>王牌还都在我们手里
<19-3,SMITH>we still hold all the cards.

367
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,870
<19-4,CASTLE>不行  她已经去找那个狙击手了
<19-4,CASTLE>No, she's already on to her shooter.

368
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,180
<19-4,CASTLE>她不会放手的
<19-4,CASTLE>She's not gonna let go.

369
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,720
<19-5,SMITH>那就有麻烦了
<19-5,SMITH>Then we have a problem.

370
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,480
<19-5,SMITH>如果她不停止  他们就会报复
<19-5,SMITH>If she doesn't stop, they will retaliate.

371
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,830
<19-5,SMITH>如果你控制不了她
<19-5,SMITH>Now I can't control the situation

372
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,860
<19-5,SMITH>我也控制不了局面
<19-5,SMITH>if you can't control her.

373
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,190
<20-1,BECKETT>光是毒品和枪支的指控
<20-1,BECKETT>I got enough on the drug and weapons charges

374
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,990
<20-1,BECKETT>就足够让你坐五年牢了
<20-1,BECKETT>to put you away for at least five years.

375
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,620
<20-1,BECKETT>生命中的五年...
<20-1,BECKETT>Five years of your life...

376
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,810
<20-2,BECKETT>那有什么价值
<20-2,BECKETT>What's that worth?

377
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,860
<20-2,BECKETT>我知道你没杀奥兰多
<20-2,BECKETT>I know you didn't kill Orlando.

378
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,900
<20-2,BECKETT>但他给你打了电话
<20-2,BECKETT>But he called you,

379
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,960
<20-2,BECKETT>你和他谈了两分钟
<20-2,BECKETT>and you talked to him for two minutes,

380
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,660
<20-2,BECKETT>而且你去过那个巷子
<20-2,BECKETT>and you were in that alley.

381
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,180
<20-2,BECKETT>为什么
<20-2,BECKETT>Why?

382
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,400
<20-3,BECKETT>这里除了你和我没有其他人
<20-3,BECKETT>There's nobody in here but you and me.

383
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,660
<20-3,BECKETT>这里没有摄像头
<20-3,BECKETT>There's no cameras,

384
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,440
<20-3,BECKETT>没有麦克风  没人在听
<20-3,BECKETT>no microphones, no one's listening.

385
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,920
<20-3,BECKETT>我能撤销所有指控
<20-3,BECKETT>I can make all those charges go away.

386
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,800
<20-3,BECKETT>还你五年的生命
<20-3,BECKETT>Five years of your life back,

387
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
<20-3,BECKETT>但是你得告诉我你知道什么
<20-3,BECKETT>but you gotta tell me what you know.

388
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,720
<20-4,DIEGO>他上周打电话给我
<20-4,DIEGO>He called last week.

389
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,900
<20-4,DIEGO>说"时运不济啊"
<20-4,DIEGO>Talking about "Times were bad,"

390
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,300
<20-4,DIEGO>所以我告诉他"我能给你份工作"
<20-4,DIEGO>So I told him, "I can get you some work."

391
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,990
<20-4,DIEGO>但是他知道  如果他回到卡扎多斯帮
<20-4,DIEGO>But he knew if he came back to the Cazadores,

392
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,320
<20-4,DIEGO>这次就出不去了
<20-4,DIEGO>there'd be no leaving this time.

393
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,180
<20-4,DIEGO>他就是想借点钱
<20-4,DIEGO>And all he really wanted was a loan

394
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,620
<20-4,DIEGO>求我看在以前的份上帮他一把
<20-4,DIEGO>and could I help him out for old times' sake.

395
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,600
<20-5,BECKETT>你借他了吗
<20-5,BECKETT>Did you give it to him?

396
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,470
<20-6,DIEGO>没有  他求我了
<20-6,DIEGO>No. He begged me.

397
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,010
<20-6,DIEGO>他说他能还上
<20-6,DIEGO>Said he was good for it.

398
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,500
<20-6,DIEGO>说他有笔大买卖
<20-6,DIEGO>Said he had something big coming up,

399
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,670
<20-6,DIEGO>让他有钱可周转
<20-6,DIEGO>something that'd make him whole.

400
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,510
<20-7,BECKETT>他说是什么了吗
<20-7,BECKETT>Did he say what?

401
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,270
<20-8,DIEGO>没有  但那天早晨  我电话响了
<20-8,DIEGO>No, but that morning, my phone rings,

402
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,690
<20-8,DIEGO>他说事情出了岔子
<20-8,DIEGO>and he said it'd all gone wrong,

403
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,340
<20-8,DIEGO>他很绝望  说他们要杀了他
<20-8,DIEGO>he was desperate, talking about they were gonna kill him.

404
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,650
<20-9,BECKETT>他们是谁
<20-9,BECKETT>Who's they?

405
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,720
<20-9,BECKETT>不知道
<20-9,BECKETT>Don't know.

406
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,350
<20-10,DIEGO>但他害怕极了
<20-10,DIEGO>But he was scared.

407
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,800
<20-11,BECKETT>他为什么给你打电话
<20-11,BECKETT>Why did he call you?

408
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,360
<20-12,DIEGO>寻求保护  小妞
<20-12,DIEGO>Protection, Chica.

409
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,170
<20-12,DIEGO>他说如果我帮他  他会回到帮里
<20-12,DIEGO>He said if I helped him out, he'd come back,

410
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,880
<20-12,DIEGO>他知道那就是代价
<20-12,DIEGO>and he knew that was the price.

411
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,710
<20-13,BECKETT>于是我告诉他在哪见
<20-13,BECKETT>So I told him where to meet.

412
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,050
<20-12,DIEGO>但我到的时候  他已经死了
<20-12,DIEGO>But by the time I got there, he was already dead.

413
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,710
<20-13,BECKETT>你定的地点
<20-13,BECKETT>You told him where to meet?

414
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,800
<20-14,DIEGO>没错
<20-14,DIEGO>That's right.

415
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,840
<20-15,BECKETT>-没告诉别人吧  -没有
<20-15,BECKETT>- You didn't tell anyone else? - No.

416
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,740
<20-17,BECKETT>你在那儿看见什么了吗
<20-17,BECKETT>Did you see anything there?

417
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,380
<20-18,DIEGO>一个白人  1米8
<20-18,DIEGO>White guy, 6'.

418
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,600
<20-18,DIEGO>跑进夜色之前我瞄到了一眼
<20-18,DIEGO>Caught a glimpse before the night swallowed him whole.

419
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,010
<21-1,BECKETT>他们一定窃听了奥兰多的电话
<21-1,BECKETT>They must have been tapping Orlando's phone.

420
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,340
<21-1,BECKETT>只有这样他们才能先到那里
<21-1,BECKETT>That's the only way they got there first.

421
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,910
<21-1,BECKETT>但他们为什么找上奥兰多呢
<21-1,BECKETT>But how did they know to target Orlando for the job?

422
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,990
<21-2,CASTLE>因为他非常想要钱
<21-2,CASTLE>Because he was desperate for money.

423
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,410
<21-3,BECKETT>对  但他们怎么知道的呢
<21-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but how did they know that?

424
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,450
<21-3,BECKETT>他们怎么知道他的背景的
<21-3,BECKETT>How did they know his background?

425
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,910
<21-4,ESPOSITO>是军队里认识的人
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Because they knew him from the military.

426
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,510
<21-4,ESPOSITO>他是被熟人雇佣的
<21-4,ESPOSITO>He was hired by somebody he knew.

427
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,550
<21-5,BECKETT>可以从这里开始查起
<21-5,BECKETT>It's a place to start.

428
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,250
<21-6,CASTLE>但是接近那个秘密的人都死了
<21-6,CASTLE>But whoever's gotten close to that secret is dead.

429
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,260
<21-6,CASTLE>情况很清楚  这事我们管不了
<21-6,CASTLE>I think it's clear, we're in over our heads here.

430
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,820
<21-7,ESPOSITO>那是你自己的看法  兄弟
<21-7,ESPOSITO>Speak for yourself, bro.

431
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,190
<21-8,RYAN>奥兰多的财务状况出来了
<21-8,RYAN>Orlando's financials just came in.

432
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,500
<21-8,RYAN>直到上周  他一直负债  透支
<21-8,RYAN>He was underwater and overdrawn until last week

433
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,920
<21-8,RYAN>直到他账户上收到了一万美金的电子汇款
<21-8,RYAN>when a wire transfer for 10 grand hit his account.

434
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,850
<21-9,BECKETT>怕是追踪不到来源吧
<21-9,BECKETT>Let me guess. Untraceable?

435
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,610
<21-10,CASTLE>那就没办法了
<21-10,CASTLE>So it's a dead end.

436
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,780
<21-11,RYAN>存款查不了
<21-11,RYAN>The deposits are,

437
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,940
<21-11,RYAN>但可追查借记卡取款记录
<21-11,RYAN>but the debit withdrawals are not.

438
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,810
<21-12,CASTLE>钱刚打进去
<21-12,CASTLE>Right when the money came in,

439
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,370
<21-12,CASTLE>玛丽萨尔就在用卡付款了
<21-12,CASTLE>Marisol started using it to pay bills.

440
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,090
<21-13,BECKETT>等一下  如果玛丽萨尔知道钱的事
<21-13,BECKETT>Wait. If Marisol knew about the money...

441
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,020
<21-14,ESPOSITO>那她一定清楚奥兰多没干好事
<21-14,ESPOSITO>Then she knew Orlando was up to something.

442
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,250
<21-15,BECKETT>她骗了我们
<21-15,BECKETT>She lied to us.

443
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,000
<21-16,RYAN>不仅如此  银行方面称
<21-16,RYAN>Not only that, but according to the bank,

444
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,880
<21-16,RYAN>一小时前她提走了账户的全部资金
<21-16,RYAN>she cleaned out the entire account an hour ago.

445
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,130
<21-17,BECKETT>她准备跑路了
<21-17,BECKETT>She's on the run.

446
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,790
<22-1,BECKETT>在你离开之前  我有几个问题想问你
<22-1,BECKETT>I've got a few questions for you before you leave town,

447
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,160
<22-1,BECKETT>而这一次
<22-1,BECKETT>and this time,

448
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,780
<22-1,BECKETT>我要听真相
<22-1,BECKETT>I want the truth.

449
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,700
<23-1,MARISOL>我说的是事实
<23-1,MARISOL>I'm telling you the truth.

450
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,730
<23-1,MARISOL>我此前不了解钱的事情
<23-1,MARISOL>I didn't know anything about the money.

451
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,940
<23-1,MARISOL>今天才知道的
<23-1,MARISOL>Not until today.

452
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,140
<23-2,BECKETT>那为何钱刚一到账
<23-2,BECKETT>So why do we have debits against it

453
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,580
<23-2,BECKETT>你就立马把钱提走
<23-2,BECKETT>the moment it appeared in your account?

454
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,750
<23-4,BECKETT>-是奥兰多  -那是你的卡  玛丽萨尔
<23-4,BECKETT>- Orlando-- - It was your card, Marisol.

455
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,200
<23-4,BECKETT>奥兰多在为谁效力
<23-4,BECKETT>Who was Orlando working for?

456
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,860
<23-5,BECKETT>你知道不与我们合作的下场是什么吗
<23-5,BECKETT>Do you know what's gonna happen if you don't cooperate?

457
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,670
<23-5,BECKETT>你会蹲进大牢
<23-5,BECKETT>You're gonna go to jail

458
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,570
<23-5,BECKETT>而你的孩子会被送去寄养家庭
<23-5,BECKETT>and your kid's gonna go to foster care.

459
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,690
<23-5,BECKETT>-那是你想要的吗  -贝克特
<23-5,BECKETT>- Is that what you want? - Beckett--

460
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,510
<23-7,BECKETT>到时马克就会游荡大街  像他爸一样
<23-7,BECKETT>Marco on the streets, enlisted by the cazadores

461
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,340
<23-7,BECKETT>十岁就被拉去当混混
<23-7,BECKETT>at age 10 like his father,

462
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,860
<23-7,BECKETT>十九岁就死于非命
<23-7,BECKETT>dead in a gutter at 19!

463
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,360
<23-7,BECKETT>你去死
<23-7,BECKETT>Pudrete en el infierno!

464
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,870
<23-9,CASTLE>贝克特  够了
<23-9,CASTLE>Beckett... That's enough.

465
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,710
<23-10,MARISOL>奥兰多说那是他在部队里认识的一个人
<23-10,MARISOL>Orlando said it was someone he knew from the service,

466
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,310
<23-10,MARISOL>是个危险人物
<23-10,MARISOL>someone dangerous.

467
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,570
<23-10,MARISOL>但活儿是一次性的
<23-10,MARISOL>But it was just a one-off,

468
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,700
<23-10,MARISOL>轻而易举就能拿不少钱
<23-10,MARISOL>a lot of money for an easy job.

469
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,670
<23-10,MARISOL>而我们非常拮据
<23-10,MARISOL>And we needed the money.

470
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,190
<23-11,BECKETT>究竟是什么工作
<23-11,BECKETT>What was the job?

471
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,630
<23-12,MARISOL>他们需要一个
<23-12,MARISOL>They needed files...

472
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,570
<23-12,MARISOL>已故警察家里的文件
<23-12,MARISOL>from a dead cop's house.

473
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,070
<23-13,CASTLE>什么文件
<23-13,CASTLE>What files?

474
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,050
<23-14,MARISOL>所有文件  只要能找到的
<23-14,MARISOL>All of them, any he could find.

475
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,710
<23-15,BECKETT>那你知道部队里那人的名字吗
<23-15,BECKETT>This guy from the service, did you get a name?

476
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,760
<23-16,MARISOL>-不知道  -你见过他没
<23-16,MARISOL>- No. - Did you meet him?

477
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,620
<23-18,MARISOL>没有
<23-18,MARISOL>No.

478
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,980
<23-19,CASTLE>他往家里打过电话吗
<23-19,CASTLE>Did he ever call the house?

479
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,180
<23-20,MARISOL>他在邮箱里留了纸条
<23-20,MARISOL>He left notes for Orlando in the mail box

480
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,600
<23-20,MARISOL>说明时间地点
<23-20,MARISOL>with a time and place.

481
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,640
<23-20,MARISOL>是用密码写的  所以我看不懂
<23-20,MARISOL>They were coded so I-I wouldn't know where.

482
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,220
<23-20,MARISOL>但我有次在车里
<23-20,MARISOL>But I was in the car once.

483
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,470
<23-20,MARISOL>看到他们的见面地点了
<23-20,MARISOL>I saw where they met.

484
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,820
<23-20,MARISOL>是个教堂
<23-20,MARISOL>At a church

485
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,960
<23-20,MARISOL>在道富银行旁边
<23-20,MARISOL>over on State Street.

486
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,110
<24-1,PRIEST>你说周三是吗
<24-1,PRIEST>Wednesday, you say?

487
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,410
<24-2,BECKETT>对  下午三点左右
<24-2,BECKETT>Yeah, around 3:00 p.m.

488
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,200
<24-3,CASTLE>他在与某人会面
<24-3,CASTLE>He was meeting with someone.

489
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,550
<24-4,PRIEST>抱歉  我也希望能帮上忙
<24-4,PRIEST>I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

490
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,620
<24-5,CASTLE>但我们教堂是对外公开的
<24-5,CASTLE>But we're open to the public,

491
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,450
<24-4,PRIEST>每天都有许多混杂人员出入
<24-4,PRIEST>and we get a lot of unfamiliar faces every day.

492
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,260
<24-4,PRIEST>我们通常让他们自己祷告
<24-4,PRIEST>We usually just leave them to their prayers.

493
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,290
<24-5,CASTLE>从你的捐赠箱来看
<24-5,CASTLE>If your donation box is any indication,

494
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,820
<24-5,CASTLE>对外公开也是要付出代价的啊
<24-5,CASTLE>it looks like being open to the public comes with a price.

495
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,680
<24-6,PRIEST>是啊  这一片比较混乱
<24-6,PRIEST>Yes, well... it's not the best neighborhood.

496
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,290
<24-6,PRIEST>我们经常能抓到小混混或者流浪者
<24-6,PRIEST>We catch gang kids and the homeless all the time,

497
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,580
<24-6,PRIEST>想从我们这里捞点好处
<24-6,PRIEST>trying to take advantage of more than just our outreach programs.

498
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,580
<24-7,BECKETT>怎么抓呢
<24-7,BECKETT>How do you catch them?

499
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,240
<25-1,RYAN>就这里  周三下午三点
<25-1,RYAN>Here it is, 3 p.m. Wednesday.

500
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,060
<25-2,RYAN>是奥兰多
<25-2,RYAN>There's Orlando.

501
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,760
<25-3,ESPOSITO>他出现了
<25-3,ESPOSITO>That's him.

502
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,200
<25-4,BECKETT>该死
<25-4,BECKETT>Damn it.

503
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,920
<25-5,BECKETT>快出来
<25-5,BECKETT>Come on.

504
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,190
<25-6,BECKETT>有了
<25-6,BECKETT>Yes.

505
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,310
<25-7,BECKETT>原来你长这个样子
<25-7,BECKETT>So that's what you look like.

506
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,210
<25-8,ESPOSITO>我把图像拿去用军队信息系统查一下
<25-8,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna run this through army C.I.D.

507
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,630
<25-8,ESPOSITO>如果他们在部队相识  那奥兰多
<25-8,ESPOSITO>If they met in the military someone in Orlando's old unit

508
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,480
<25-8,ESPOSITO>以前部队的战友或许能认出他
<25-8,ESPOSITO>might be able to I.D. Him.

509
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,520
<25-9,BECKETT>不行  我们不知此事涉及何人
<25-9,BECKETT>No, no, we don't know who's involved

510
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,930
<25-9,BECKETT>也不知事态会上升到何种等级
<25-9,BECKETT>and we don't know how high this goes.

511
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,210
<25-9,BECKETT>我们把相片公开
<25-9,BECKETT>The minute we put this photo out there,

512
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,090
<25-9,BECKETT>就如同打草惊蛇  他到时趁机逃跑
<25-9,BECKETT>these people are gonna know. He's gonna disappear,

513
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,250
<25-9,BECKETT>我们就再也找不到他了
<25-9,BECKETT>and we'll never see him again.

514
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,660
<25-9,BECKETT>这次我们得自己查
<25-9,BECKETT>We have to do this one on our own.

515
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,400
<25-10,RYAN>贝克特  那是不可能的
<25-10,RYAN>Beckett, that's impossible.

516
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,290
<25-10,RYAN>我们只有一张相片
<25-10,RYAN>All we have is a face--

517
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,360
<25-10,RYAN>不清楚姓名  身份  无从下手啊
<25-10,RYAN>no name, no I.D., no way to find this guy.

518
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,380
<25-11,BECKETT>那我们就要找个方法来找到他
<25-11,BECKETT>Then we will find a way to find him.

519
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,400
<25-11,BECKETT>我不会放弃这条线索的
<25-11,BECKETT>I'm not gonna lose this lead.

520
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,910
<25-12,RYAN>我们不能动手查的话
<25-12,RYAN>How are we supposed to investigate

521
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,230
<25-12,RYAN>那要怎么查呢
<25-12,RYAN>if we can't investigate?

522
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,340
<25-13,ESPOSITO>你听到她说的了
<25-13,ESPOSITO>You heard the lady.

523
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,870
<25-13,ESPOSITO>我们要另寻他法
<25-13,ESPOSITO>We find a way.

524
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,160
<26-1,MCCALISTER>你把恶魔唤醒了
<26-1,MCCALISTER>You woke the dragon.

525
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,060
<26-1,MCCALISTER>这事比你想象中要严重得多
<26-1,MCCALISTER>And this is so much bigger than you realize.

526
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,360
<26-2,CASTLE>凯特
<26-2,CASTLE>Kate!

527
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,910
<26-2,CASTLE>撑住
<26-2,CASTLE>Don't die!

528
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,150
<26-3,BECKETT>逃不出我的手掌
<26-3,BECKETT>He can't hide from me.

529
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,090
<26-4,LOCKWOOD>你弄反了
<26-4,LOCKWOOD>You got it ass backwards.

530
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,440
<26-4,LOCKWOOD>是你逃不出他的手掌
<26-4,LOCKWOOD>You can't hide from him.

531
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,970
<26-6,RAGLAN>我犯了一个大错
<26-6,RAGLAN>I made a bad mistake.

532
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,950
<26-7,BECKETT>是谁雇得你
<26-7,BECKETT>Who hired you to kill her?

533
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,990
<26-8,DICK COONAN>别管了  你永远都撼动不了他们
<26-8,DICK COONAN>Forget it. You'll never touch 'em.

535
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,760
<27-2,CASTLE>我刚跟埃斯波西托通完电话
<27-2,CASTLE>I just got off the phone with Esposito.

536
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,190
<27-3,BECKETT>凶手手上有个钥匙串
<27-3,BECKETT>Our killer had a keychain,

537
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,630
<27-3,BECKETT>和屹威汽车租赁公司的相吻合
<27-3,BECKETT>and he matched it to Eastway Car Rentals.

538
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,880
<27-4,CASTLE>那可能是一千辆车里的某一个
<27-4,CASTLE>That could be any one of a thousand cars.

539
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,030
<27-5,BECKETT>我知道  就像大海捞针一样
<27-5,BECKETT>I know, it's a needle in a haystack,

540
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,220
<27-5,BECKETT>但起码我们找到了那片海
<27-5,BECKETT>but at least it's a haystack,

541
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,360
<27-5,BECKETT>而且很多档案都在
<27-5,BECKETT>And they keep most of their licenses on file.

542
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
<27-7,BECKETT>-凯特  -是  他很可能用的是假身份证
<27-7,BECKETT>- Kate-- - Yeah, he's probably using a fake I.D.

543
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,870
<27-7,BECKETT>但是我们应该能从那儿缩小范围
<27-7,BECKETT>But we should be able to narrow it down from there.

544
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,780
<27-9,BECKETT>-凯特  -怎么了
<27-9,BECKETT>- Kate. - What's wrong?

545
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,320
<27-10,CASTLE>你...
<27-10,CASTLE>You, um...

546
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,760
<27-10,CASTLE>你得停手了
<27-10,CASTLE>You have to stop.

547
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,050
<27-10,CASTLE>这个调查你不能再继续下去了
<27-10,CASTLE>This investigation, you--you have to stop.

548
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,730
<27-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这件事我们已经讨论过了
<27-11,BECKETT>Castle, we already talked about this.

549
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,920
<27-11,BECKETT>我没事  我控制得住
<27-11,BECKETT>I'm fine. I'm in control.

550
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,610
<27-11,BECKETT>不  你控制不了
<27-11,BECKETT>No, you're not.

551
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,850
<27-12,CASTLE>他们才是掌控者
<27-12,CASTLE>They are.

552
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,940
<27-12,CASTLE>如果你还不停手  他们会杀了你  凯特
<27-12,CASTLE>And if you don't stop, they will kill you, Kate.

553
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,210
<27-13,BECKETT>你在说什么啊
<27-13,BECKETT>What are you talking about?

554
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,330
<27-14,CASTLE>蒙哥马利进机库之前
<27-14,CASTLE>Before Montgomery went into that hangar,

555
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,710
<27-14,CASTLE>寄了一个包裹给一个人
<27-14,CASTLE>he sent a package to someone,

556
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,380
<27-14,CASTLE>一个他信任的人
<27-14,CASTLE>someone... he trusted.

557
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,140
<27-14,CASTLE>里面的信息
<27-14,CASTLE>It contained information

558
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,860
<27-14,CASTLE>可以毁掉这一切事件的幕后黑手
<27-14,CASTLE>damaging to the person behind all this.

559
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,950
<27-14,CASTLE>蒙哥马利想保护你
<27-14,CASTLE>Montgomery was trying to protect you.

560
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
<27-15,CASTLE>但是你被枪击之后  包裹才寄到
<27-15,CASTLE>but the package didn't arrive until after you'd been shot.

561
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,520
<27-15,CASTLE>蒙哥马利的朋友
<27-15,CASTLE>Montgomery's friend...

562
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,300
<27-15,CASTLE>跟他们达成了协议
<27-15,CASTLE>struck a deal with them.

563
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,070
<27-15,CASTLE>如果他们不再找你麻烦
<27-15,CASTLE>If they left you alone,

564
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,880
<27-15,CASTLE>包裹里的信息
<27-15,CASTLE>that package and the information inside

565
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,760
<27-15,CASTLE>永远都不会曝光
<27-15,CASTLE>would never see the light of day.

566
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,240
<27-15,CASTLE>但他们提了一个要求  你必须放弃调查
<27-15,CASTLE>But they made one condition-- you had to back off.

567
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,120
<27-15,CASTLE>所以你还活着  凯特
<27-15,CASTLE>And that's the reason you're alive, Kate,

568
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,070
<27-15,CASTLE>因为你罢手了
<27-15,CASTLE>because you stopped.

569
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,570
<27-16,BECKETT>你怎么知道的
<27-16,BECKETT>How do you know this?

570
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,180
<27-17,CASTLE>为了确保交易生效
<27-17,CASTLE>In order for the deal to work,

571
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,960
<27-17,CASTLE>要有人能保证你不再追究这件案子
<27-17,CASTLE>someone had to make sure you weren't pursuing it.

572
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,630
<27-18,BECKETT>这个人是你吗
<27-18,BECKETT>Are you a part of this?

573
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,780
<27-19,CASTLE>我只是想保护你
<27-19,CASTLE>I was just trying to keep you safe.

574
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,060
<27-20,BECKETT>通过对我撒谎吗
<27-20,BECKETT>By lying to me

575
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,480
<27-20,BECKETT>对我生命中最重要的事撒谎吗
<27-20,BECKETT>about the most important thing in my life?

576
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,580
<27-21,CASTLE>只有说谎才能保护你
<27-21,CASTLE>That lie was the only thing that was protecting you.

577
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,240
<27-22,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不需要保护
<27-22,BECKETT>Castle, I didn't need protection.

578
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,320
<27-22,BECKETT>我要的是线索
<27-22,BECKETT>I needed a lead,

579
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,930
<27-22,BECKETT>你却瞒了我一年
<27-22,BECKETT>and you sat on it for a year.

580
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,730
<27-22,BECKETT>这个人是谁  我怎么才能找到他
<27-22,BECKETT>Now who is this person? How do I find him?

581
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,780
<27-23,CASTLE>我只听过他的声音
<27-23,CASTLE>He's a-a voice on the phone.

582
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,470
<27-23,CASTLE>在停车场里看过一个阴影
<27-23,CASTLE>He's a shadow in a parking garage.

583
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,800
<27-24,BECKETT>你见过他
<27-24,BECKETT>You met with him?

584
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,830
<27-24,BECKETT>你怎么能知道他不是幕后黑手
<27-24,BECKETT>How do you know that he's not behind my mom's murder?

585
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,910
<27-24,BECKETT>你怎么知道他没卷进那个案子
<27-24,BECKETT>How do you know that he's not involved?

586
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,100
<27-24,BECKETT>你怎么能这么做
<27-24,BECKETT>And how the hell could you do this?

587
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,050
<27-25,CASTLE>因为我爱你
<27-25,CASTLE>Because I love you.

588
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,700
<27-26,CASTLE>不过你已经知道了  对吗
<27-26,CASTLE>But you already know that, don't you?

589
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,400
<27-26,CASTLE>你已经知道一年了
<27-26,CASTLE>You've known for about a year.

590
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,570
<27-27,BECKETT>你开什么玩笑
<27-27,BECKETT>Are you kidding me?

591
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,110
<27-27,BECKETT>你现在来追究这个
<27-27,BECKETT>You're actually bringing this up right now,

592
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,560
<27-27,BECKETT>在你说了背叛我之后吗
<27-27,BECKETT>after you told me that you just betrayed me?

593
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,410
<27-28,CASTLE>凯特  听我说
<27-28,CASTLE>Kate, listen to me--

594
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,950
<27-29,BECKETT>听你说  我为什么要听你的
<27-29,BECKETT>Listen to you? Why should I listen to you?

595
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,100
<27-29,BECKETT>我怎么能再相信你的任何一句话
<27-29,BECKETT>How I am even supposed to trust anything that you say?

596
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:15,960
<27-29,BECKETT>你怎么...
<27-29,BECKETT>How are you s--

597
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,620
<27-30,CASTLE>就凭我们这些年一起经历过的事
<27-30,CASTLE>Because of everything we've been through together!

598
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,670
<27-30,CASTLE>四年了  我一直在你身边
<27-30,CASTLE>Four years, I've been right here.

599
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,830
<27-30,CASTLE>四年来  我一直在等你能睁眼看看
<27-30,CASTLE>Four years just waiting for you to just open your eyes,

600
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,150
<27-30,CASTLE>看看我在你身边
<27-30,CASTLE>to see that I'm right here

601
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,410
<27-30,CASTLE>不仅仅只是个搭档
<27-30,CASTLE>and that I'm more than a partner.

602
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,640
<27-31,CASTLE>每天早上  我带咖啡给你
<27-31,CASTLE>Every morning, I-I bring you a cup of coffee

603
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,890
<27-31,CASTLE>就是想看到你脸上的微笑
<27-31,CASTLE>just so I could see a smile on your face

604
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,360
<27-31,CASTLE>因为我觉得你是我见过的...
<27-31,CASTLE>because I think you are the most...

605
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,460
<27-31,CASTLE>最出色
<27-31,CASTLE>remarkable...

606
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,130
<27-31,CASTLE>最令人疯狂
<27-31,CASTLE>maddening...

607
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,850
<27-31,CASTLE>最富挑战性
<27-31,CASTLE>challenging...

608
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,130
<27-31,CASTLE>最让人挫败的人
<27-31,CASTLE>frustrating person I have ever met.

609
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,430
<27-31,CASTLE>我爱你  凯特  如果...
<27-31,CASTLE>And I love you, Kate, and if...

610
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,130
<27-31,CASTLE>这件事对你还有一丁点意义
<27-31,CASTLE>that means anything to you,

611
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,240
<27-31,CASTLE>如果你还在乎我  哪怕一点点
<27-31,CASTLE>If you care about me at all,

612
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,640
<27-31,CASTLE>别再纠结这件事了
<27-31,CASTLE>just don't do this.

613
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,210
<27-32,BECKETT>如果我在乎你
<27-32,BECKETT>If I care about you?

614
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,410
<27-32,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你为了我的性命做交易
<27-32,BECKETT>Castle, you cut a deal for my life

615
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,540
<27-32,BECKETT>就跟我是小孩子一样
<27-32,BECKETT>like I was some kind of a child.

616
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,160
<27-32,BECKETT>这是我的命  我的
<27-32,BECKETT>My life, mine...

617
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,480
<27-32,BECKETT>你没权利做决定
<27-32,BECKETT>you don't get to decide.

618
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,440
<27-33,CASTLE>如果你还不放手
<27-33,CASTLE>You keep going with this,

619
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,570
<27-33,CASTLE>决定权就在他们手上了
<27-33,CASTLE>they're gonna decide.

620
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,670
<27-33,CASTLE>他们就会来对付你  凯特
<27-33,CASTLE>They're gonna come for you, Kate.

621
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,930
<27-34,BECKETT>让他们放马过来
<27-34,BECKETT>Let them come.

622
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,620
<27-34,BECKETT>库南来了  死了
<27-34,BECKETT>They sent Coonan, and he is dead.

623
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,990
<27-34,BECKETT>洛克伍德来了  也死了
<27-34,BECKETT>They sent Lockwood, and he is dead.

624
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,390
<27-34,BECKETT>我还活得好好的  卡塞尔
<27-34,BECKETT>And I am still here, Castle,

625
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,890
<27-34,BECKETT>我准备好了
<27-34,BECKETT>and I am ready.

<27-35,CASTLE>为了你的事业献身吗
<27-35,CASTLE>To-to die for your cause?

628
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,930
<27-35,CASTLE>这已不再是单纯的凶案调查了  凯特
<27-35,CASTLE>This isn't a murder investigation anymore, Kate.

629
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,560
<27-35,CASTLE>他们已经将此升级成战争了
<27-35,CASTLE>They've turned it into a war.

630
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,420
<27-36,BECKETT>如果他们想要战争  我乐意奉陪
<27-36,BECKETT>If they want a war, then I will bring them a war,

631
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,500
<27-36,BECKETT>打到他们老巢去
<27-36,BECKETT>straight to their doorsteps.

632
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,880
<27-37,CASTLE>我没法说服你了  是吗
<27-37,CASTLE>Well, I guess there's just nothing I can say, is there?

636
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,380
<27-37,CASTLE>你有权利舍弃它
<27-37,CASTLE>You can throw it away if you want,

640
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,220
<27-37,CASTLE>我退出
<27-37,CASTLE>I'm done.

641
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,530
<28-1,ALEXIS>一切都好吗

643
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,800
<28-3,ALEXIS>我已经把所有毕业演讲
<28-3,ALEXIS>I have watched or read

644
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,520
<28-3,ALEXIS>都观看或是阅读过了
<28-3,ALEXIS>every graduation address ever written

645
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,300
<28-3,ALEXIS>并且把其中所有好建议都汇编到一个演讲中
<28-3,ALEXIS>and compiled all the best advice into one speech,

646
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,670
<28-3,ALEXIS>然后我再大声朗读出来
<28-3,ALEXIS>and then I read it out loud.

647
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,810
<28-3,ALEXIS>你知道我听起来像什么
<28-3,ALEXIS>And guess what I sounded like.

648
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,120
<28-3,ALEXIS>像个自大狂
<28-3,ALEXIS>Like a pompous ass.

649
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,380
<28-3,ALEXIS>我只有18岁  又能懂什么大道理呢
<28-3,ALEXIS>I'm 18 years old. What the hell do I know?

<28-5,ALEXIS>我只知道  一切都在改变
<28-5,ALEXIS>All I know is, everything's changing.

654
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,100
<28-5,ALEXIS>一切都会时过境迁
<28-5,ALEXIS>Everything's going to be different,

655
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,900
<28-5,ALEXIS>我很害怕
<28-5,ALEXIS>and I'm so scared.

656
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,180
<28-6,CASTLE>害怕什么
<28-6,CASTLE>Of what?

657
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,740
<28-7,ALEXIS>朝前看
<28-7,ALEXIS>Moving on.

658
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,410
<28-8,CASTLE>把这个写下来
<28-8,CASTLE>Write about that.

659
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,690
<28-8,CASTLE>这种感觉很真切
<28-8,CASTLE>That feels true.

660
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,700
<28-8,CASTLE>乔安娜·贝克特
<28-8,CASTLE>真理征服一切

661
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,420
<28-8,CASTLE>乔安娜·贝克特
<28-8,CASTLE>真理征服一切

662
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,780
<29-1,RYAN>卡塞尔呢
<29-1,RYAN>Where's Castle?

663
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,960
<29-2,BECKETT>他退出了
<29-2,BECKETT>He's off the team.

664
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,720
<29-3,BECKETT>我们有什么进展吗
<29-3,BECKETT>So what do we got?

665
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,330
<29-4,ESPOSITO>屹威汽车租赁公司上周三共出租了700辆车
<29-4,ESPOSITO>Eastway rented 700 cars last wednesday.

666
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,020
<29-5,RYAN>我们认为嫌疑人使用化名
<29-5,RYAN>We believe our suspect is going under the name

667
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,170
<29-5,RYAN>科尔·马多克斯来登记
<29-5,RYAN>Cole Maddox.

668
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,650
<29-5,RYAN>他从肯尼迪机场将车租出
<29-5,RYAN>He rented out of J.F.K.

669
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,310
<29-6,ESPOSITO>使用了堪萨斯的驾驶执照
<29-6,ESPOSITO>It's a kansas driver's license.

670
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,960
<29-6,ESPOSITO>经过调查我们发现这是伪造的身份
<29-6,ESPOSITO>Now we did some digging. It's a cover I.D.

671
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:23,810
<29-7,BECKETT>他把车归还了吗
<29-7,BECKETT>Did he return the car?

672
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,490
<29-7,BECKETT>没有  但是
<29-7,BECKETT>No, but...

673
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,710
<29-8,ESPOSITO>屹威对其所有车辆
<29-8,ESPOSITO>Eastway maintains

674
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,640
<29-8,ESPOSITO>都实施了GPS跟踪
<29-8,ESPOSITO>GPS tracking on all of its equipment,

675
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,560
<29-8,ESPOSITO>所以我们追踪到了下东区
<29-8,ESPOSITO>So we tracked it to the lower east side

676
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,810
<29-8,ESPOSITO>锁定在这个方圆一街区的地方
<29-8,ESPOSITO>to a 1-block radius somewhere along here.

677
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,560
<29-9,BECKETT>你继续保持监视
<29-9,BECKETT>All right, you stay on grid.

678
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,460
<29-9,BECKETT>如果他离开就通知我们
<29-9,BECKETT>Let us know if he moves.

679
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,100
<29-9,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  你和我行动
<29-9,BECKETT>Esposito, you're coming with me.

680
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,080
<29-9,BECKETT>你要做什么
<29-9,BECKETT>What are you doing?

681
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,540
<29-10,RYAN>如果你真要去抓他  就该布置周密
<29-10,RYAN>You want to do this, you do it right.

682
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,080
<29-10,RYAN>派一支小队控制住车子  并且带上后援
<29-10,RYAN>You put a team on that car and you bring backup with you.

683
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,320
<29-11,BECKETT>莱恩  这一切都源起于
<29-11,BECKETT>Ryan, this whole thing started

684
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,440
<29-11,BECKETT>一群堕落的警察
<29-11,BECKETT>because of a group of corrupt cops.

685
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,430
<29-11,BECKETT>你怎么能轻易相信他人
<29-11,BECKETT>How do you know there aren't more out there?

686
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,120
<29-11,BECKETT>我们就要抓到他了
<29-11,BECKETT>We're about an inch away from catching this guy,

687
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,460
<29-11,BECKETT>我可不想大肆声张  功亏一篑
<29-11,BECKETT>and I'm not gonna blow it by advertising our next move.

688
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,410
<29-12,RYAN>恕我直言
<29-12,RYAN>With all due respect,

689
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,630
<29-12,RYAN>这家伙朝你心脏开了一枪后
<29-12,RYAN>this guy put a bullet in your heart

690
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,210
<29-12,RYAN>就销声匿迹了
<29-12,RYAN>and then he disappeared into the ether.

691
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,090
<29-12,RYAN>你不能打无准备的仗啊
<29-12,RYAN>You cannot go in there unprepared.

692
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,210
<29-13,BECKETT>无准备
<29-13,BECKETT>Unprepared?

693
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,680
<29-13,BECKETT>我13年来一直在准备着这一刻
<29-13,BECKETT>I've been preparing for this for the past 13 years.

694
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,920
<29-13,BECKETT>哈维尔
<29-13,BECKETT>Hey, Javier...

695
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,440
<29-14,RYAN>兄弟  别让她这么做
<29-14,RYAN>Man, don't let her do this.

696
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,880
<29-14,RYAN>太冒险了
<29-14,RYAN>It's too big of a risk.

697
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,470
<29-15,ESPOSITO>没问题的  老兄
<29-15,ESPOSITO>It's all good, bro.

<30-1,CASTLE>Come on. We don't want to miss her speech...

700
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,650
<30-1,CASTLE>甚至整个毕业典礼
<30-1,CASTLE>or the entire graduation.

701
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,860
<30-2,MARTHA>我差不多准备好了
<30-2,MARTHA>I'm almost ready.

741
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,170
<33-4,BECKETT>贝克特

742
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,290
<33-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<33-4,BECKETT>Castle?

743
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,520
<33-4,BECKETT>隐瞒证据
<33-4,BECKETT>With holding evidence,

744
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,930
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>对上级撒谎
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>lying to a superior officer--

745
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,360
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>你们的行为令纽约蒙羞  令警局蒙羞
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>What you did dishonors this city and dishonors the badge.

746
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,330
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>你们都被调离此案
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>Not only are you off this investigation,

747
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,160
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>我现在就让你们
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>I'm putting you both on administrative leave

748
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,890
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>-停职  -长官
<34-1,CAPTAIN GATES>- effective immediately. - Sir--

749
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,290
<34-3,GATES>别叫我长官
<34-3,GATES>Don't you "Sir" me.

750
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,560
<34-3,GATES>你们不配当警察
<34-3,GATES>You don't deserve to wear the uniform.

751
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,790
<34-3,GATES>交出你们的警徽和配枪
<34-3,GATES>Now hand over your badges and guns.

752
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,910
<34-4,GATES>贝克特探长
<34-4,GATES>Detective Beckett.

753
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,160
<34-5,BECKETT>收好了
<34-5,BECKETT>Keep it.

754
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,100
<34-5,BECKETT>我辞职
<34-5,BECKETT>I resign.

755
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,690
<34-5,BECKETT>有一普遍真理
<34-5,BECKETT>There's a universal truth

756
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,030
<35-1,ALEXIS>我们无法逃避
<35-1,ALEXIS>we all have to face...

757
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,290
<35-1,ALEXIS>不论我们是否情愿
<35-1,ALEXIS>Whether we want to or not,

758
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,400
<35-1,ALEXIS>万物皆有终结的一天
<35-1,ALEXIS>everything eventually ends.

759
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,010
<35-1,ALEXIS>我期盼这天到来的同时
<35-1,ALEXIS>As much as I've looked forward to this day,

760
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,330
<35-1,ALEXIS>却也有着不舍与留恋
<35-1,ALEXIS>I've always disliked endings...

761
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,770
<36-1,ALEXIS>好比夏日的最后一天
<36-1,ALEXIS>The last day of summer...

762
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,700
<36-1,ALEXIS>好书的最后一章
<36-1,ALEXIS>The final chapter of a great book...

763
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,780
<36-1,ALEXIS>与密友离别
<36-1,ALEXIS>Parting ways with a close friend.

764
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,530
<36-1,ALEXIS>结局从来不可避免
<36-1,ALEXIS>But endings are inevitable.

765
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,170
<36-2,RYAN>哈维
<36-2,RYAN>Javi.

766
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,050
<36-2,RYAN>我做了我必须做的
<36-2,RYAN>I had to.

767
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,930
<36-3,ALEXIS>秋叶飘落
<36-3,ALEXIS>Leaves fall.

768
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,920
<36-3,ALEXIS>你合上手中的书
<36-3,ALEXIS>You close the book.

769
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,550
<36-3,ALEXIS>与朋友话别
<36-3,ALEXIS>You say good-bye.

770
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,270
<37-1,ALEXIS>于我们而言  这是美好的一天
<37-1,ALEXIS>Today is one of those days for us.

771
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,790
<37-1,ALEXIS>今天  我们与过去告别
<37-1,ALEXIS>Today we say good-bye to everything that was familiar,

772
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,030
<37-1,ALEXIS>告别那些曾经的熟悉与安逸
<37-1,ALEXIS>everything that was comfortable.

773
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,230
<37-1,ALEXIS>我们继续前进
<37-1,ALEXIS>We're moving on.

774
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,960
<37-1,ALEXIS>但终因离别
<37-1,ALEXIS>But just because we're leaving,

775
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,280
<38-1,ALEXIS>而心痛万分
<38-1,ALEXIS>and that hurts...

776
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,500
<38-1,ALEXIS>那些已然走进
<38-1,ALEXIS>There are some people

777
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,380
<38-1,ALEXIS>我们生活的人
<38-1,ALEXIS>who are so much a part of us

778
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,850
<38-1,ALEXIS>无论何时  都将与我们同在
<38-1,ALEXIS>they'll be with us no matter what.

779
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,160
<38-1,ALEXIS>他们是我们坚强的后盾
<38-1,ALEXIS>They are our solid ground...

780
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,170
<39-1,ALEXIS>我们的北极星
<39-1,ALEXIS>our north star,

781
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,110
<39-1,ALEXIS>心底那声清吟
<39-1,ALEXIS>and the small clear voices in our hearts

782
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,180
<39-1,ALEXIS>将永远在我们的耳畔萦绕
<39-1,ALEXIS>that will be with us... always.

783
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,250
<39-1,ALEXIS>阿丽克西斯  别担心我
<39-1,ALEXIS>No, Alexis, I'll be fine.

784
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,300
<40-1,CASTLE>这么多电视节目  还有游戏机呢
<40-1,CASTLE>I got a thousand cable channels, I got my xbox.

785

<40-1,CASTLE>玩得开心点
<40-1,CASTLE>You have fun.

786

<40-1,CASTLE>明天午饭前我是不会担心你的
<40-1,CASTLE>I will not worry about you until lunchtime tomorrow.

787
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,390
<40-1,CASTLE>我也爱你
<40-1,CASTLE>I love you, too.

788
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,320
<40-2,CASTLE>贝克特  你想怎样
<40-2,CASTLE>Beckett, what do you want?

789
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,230
<40-3,BECKETT>我想要你
<40-3,BECKETT>You.

793
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,500
<40-5,CASTLE>发生什么事了
<40-5,CASTLE>What happened?

794
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,010
<40-6,BECKETT>他跑了  可我不在乎
<40-6,BECKETT>He got away, and I didn't care.

795
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,660
<40-6,BECKETT>在频临死亡的那一刻
<40-6,BECKETT>I almost died

796
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,470
<40-6,BECKETT>我心里想的只有你
<40-6,BECKETT>and all I could think about was you.

00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,780
<40-6,BECKETT>我只想跟你在一起
<40-6,BECKETT>I just want you.

798
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
<40-6,BECKETT>史密斯
<40-6,BECKETT>Mister...

799
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,480
<41-1,MADDOX>先生
<41-1,MADDOX>Smith?

800
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,120
<41-2,SMITH>你是谁
<41-2,SMITH>Who are you?

801
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,130
<41-3,MADDOX>你真不好找啊
<41-3,MADDOX>You've been a very hard man to find.

802
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,740
<41-4,SMITH>你想干什么
<41-4,SMITH>What do you want?

803
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,430
<41-5,MADDOX>你手中握有对我雇主不利的东西
<41-5,MADDOX>You have some sensitive information about my employer,

804
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,690
<41-5,MADDOX>就是你用来保护
<41-5,MADDOX>information that you've been using

805
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,190
<41-5,MADDOX>贝克特的信息
<41-5,MADDOX>to protect Detective Beckett.

806
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,460
<41-6,SMITH>你难道忘了
<41-6,SMITH>Are you forgetting...

807
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,510
<41-6,SMITH>我们之间的协议吗
<41-6,SMITH>we have a deal?

808
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,030
<41-7,MADDOX>那不是协议  是勒索
<41-7,MADDOX>No. What you had was blackmail.

809
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,540
<41-7,MADDOX>现在你得告诉我东西在哪
<41-7,MADDOX>Now you're gonna tell me where all that information is,

810
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,670
<41-7,MADDOX>在那之后
<41-7,MADDOX>and after you do,

811
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,610
<41-7,MADDOX>我要送凯特·贝克特归西
<41-7,MADDOX>I'm gonna put Kate Beckett in the ground once and for all.
