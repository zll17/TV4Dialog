27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,390
<1-1,ALEXIS>他们在别的国家  这怎么可能
<1-1,ALEXIS>They're in another country. How is that possible?

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,470
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>不知道  但显然
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>We don't know, but clearly

29
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,710
<2-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>绑匪受雇于他人
<2-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>the kidnappers were working for outside interests.

30
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,400
<2-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>电话里的声音已被确定为埃及人
<2-2,FBI AGENT HARRIS>The voices on the call have been identified as Egyptian.

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,570
<2-3,CASTLE>这起绑架不是为了赎金
<2-3,CASTLE>This isn't a kidnapping for ransom,

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,110
<2-3,CASTLE>对吗
<2-3,CASTLE>Is it?

33
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,700
<2-3,CASTLE>他们为什么在巴黎
<2-3,CASTLE>Why are they in Paris?

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,610
<2-5,ANWAR>我不知道
<2-5,ANWAR>I don't know.

35
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,820
<2-4,CASTLE>他们把你女儿带到那里
<2-4,CASTLE>They took your daughter there,

36
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,390
<2-4,CASTLE>还带走了我女儿  肯定是有原因的
<2-4,CASTLE>and my daughter along with her. There must be a reason.

37
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,670
<2-5,ANWAR>我不知道
<2-5,ANWAR>I don't know!

38
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,250
<2-6,CASTLE>他们在掩饰踪迹  为什么
<2-6,CASTLE>They are covering their tracks. Why?

39
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,670
<2-6,CASTLE>求你了
<2-6,CASTLE>Please.

40
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,800
<2-7,HARRIS>我们的女儿也在他们手上
<2-7,HARRIS>They have our daughter, too.

41
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,260
<2-7,HARRIS>给他们看素描图
<2-7,HARRIS>Show them the sketch.

42
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,510
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>在女孩们被绑后
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>A neighbor spotted this man

43
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,690
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>有邻居看到这个男人
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>coming out of the farmhouse driveway

44
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,570
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>从农舍的车道上出来
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>after the girls were taken.

45
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,530
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>你们有谁认识他吗
<2-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Do either of you recognize him?

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,730
<2-9,ANWAR>不  不认识
<2-9,ANWAR>No, he's not familiar.

47
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,590
<2-10,BECKETT>我们下一步怎么做
<2-10,BECKETT>So what's our next step?

48
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,330
<2-11,HARRIS>视频电话是通过手机通信网络打出的
<2-11,HARRIS>The skype call was made over a cellular data network,

49
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,830
<2-11,HARRIS>我们已将信号锁定在
<2-11,HARRIS>so we have isolated the signal

50
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,040
<2-11,HARRIS>一片30平方公里的区域内
<2-11,HARRIS>to a 30-square-kilometer area.

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,910
<2-12,BECKETT>30平方公里就是整个巴黎
<2-12,BECKETT>30-square kilometers is the whole city.

52
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,540
<2-12,BECKETT>我知道
<2-12,BECKETT>I know.

53
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,510
<2-13,HARRIS>但希望  通过分析视频
<2-13,HARRIS>But hopefully, an analysis of the video

54
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,970
<2-13,HARRIS>可以找到她们所在地的线索
<2-13,HARRIS>will give us a clue as to where they're being held.

55
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,230
<2-13,HARRIS>与此同时  我们会联系大使馆
<2-13,HARRIS>In the meantime, we're reaching out to the embassy to estab--

56
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,150
<2-14,CASTLE>联系  什么意思
<2-14,CASTLE>Reaching out? What does that mean?

57
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,510
<2-15,HARRIS>在进一步行动前
<2-15,HARRIS>There are certain protocols we have to follow

58
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,710
<2-15,HARRIS>要遵循一些程序  得到一些许可
<2-15,HARRIS>before we can move forward, permissions we have to get.

59
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,590
<2-16,CASTLE>这需要多长时间
<2-16,CASTLE>And how long will that take?

60
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,900
<2-17,HARRIS>最多一到两天
<2-17,HARRIS>A day or two at the most.

61
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,220
<2-17,HARRIS>一到...
<2-17,HARRIS>A day or...

62
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,670
<2-18,CASTLE>我们的女儿现在就被他们扣着
<2-18,CASTLE>Our daughters are out there right now.

63
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,920
<2-18,CASTLE>她们现在就需要我们去营救
<2-18,CASTLE>They need our help right now.

64
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,940
<2-19,HARRIS>如果你想救女儿
<2-19,HARRIS>If you want to help your daughter,

65
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,610
<2-19,HARRIS>就得有耐心
<2-19,HARRIS>you're gonna have to be patient.

66
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,870
<3-2,CASTLE>她在电话里好害怕
<3-2,CASTLE>She sounded so scared.

67
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,450
<3-2,CASTLE>和她小时候一样
<3-2,CASTLE>I could hear it in her voice,

68
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,500
<3-2,CASTLE>我可以从她的声音听出来
<3-2,CASTLE>just like when she was a little girl.

69
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,850
<3-2,CASTLE>我却无能为力
<3-2,CASTLE>And there was nothing I could do.

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,290
<3-3,BECKETT>她安然无恙  卡塞尔
<3-3,BECKETT>She wasn't hurt, Castle.

71
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,160
<3-3,BECKETT>这点很重要
<3-3,BECKETT>That's what matters.

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,590
<3-3,BECKETT>这是我们坚持下去的动力
<3-3,BECKETT>That's what we hold on to.

73
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,750
<3-4,CASTLE>我只想让她回家
<3-4,CASTLE>I just want her home.

74
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,290
<3-5,BECKETT>我们还没有放弃
<3-5,BECKETT>We're not giving up yet.

75
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,890
<3-6,GATES>绑匪打电话给艾尔玛提了条件
<3-6,GATES>They just called El-Masri with terms.

76
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,100
<4-1,HARRIS>太快了  我们不可能及时部署好
<4-1,HARRIS>It's too soon. We can't be in position in time.

77
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,780
<4-2,ANWAR>我不在乎  我要把她赎回来
<4-2,ANWAR>I don't care. I'm getting her back.

78
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,710
<4-3,CASTLE>-绑匪怎么说  -赎金要求
<4-3,CASTLE>- What did they say? - It was a ransom demand.

79
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,970
<4-3,CASTLE>支付反穆巴拉克组织1500万欧元
<4-3,CASTLE>$15 million euro-- from anti-mubarak dissidents.

80
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,060
<4-4,HARRIS>三小时后以钱换人
<4-4,HARRIS>They set an exchange three hours from now.

81
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,750
<4-5,BECKETT>在哪换
<4-5,BECKETT>Where?

82
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,330
<4-6,HARRIS>巴黎塞纳河的下游
<4-6,HARRIS>In Paris down by the seine.

83
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,400
<4-6,HARRIS>艾尔玛先生  你必须让我联系
<4-6,HARRIS>Mr. El-masri, you have to let me contact

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,930
<4-6,HARRIS>-有关当局  -不
<4-6,HARRIS>- the local authorities. - No!

85
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,820
<4-7,ANWAR>他们说的很清楚
<4-7,ANWAR>They were clear.

86
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,220
<4-7,ANWAR>报警的话  我女儿就没命了
<4-7,ANWAR>They see police, my daughter dies.

87
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,180
<4-7,ANWAR>我们会交赎金救她
<4-7,ANWAR>We'll pay to get her back.

88
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,640
<4-8,CASTLE>他们
<4-8,CASTLE>Did they...

89
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,700
<4-8,CASTLE>他们有没有说阿丽克西斯
<4-8,CASTLE>Did they say anything about Alexis?

90
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,770
<4-9,LINA>在安瓦尔的坚持下
<4-9,LINA>Anwar insisted,

91
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,950
<4-9,LINA>他们同意释放两个女孩子
<4-9,LINA>and they've agreed to release both our daughters.

92
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,490
<4-10,CASTLE>如果我欠你...
<4-10,CASTLE>If there is anything I owe you...

93
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,630
<4-11,ANWAR>你不欠我什么
<4-11,ANWAR>You owe me nothing.

94
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,420
<4-12,GATES>如果不报警  那么谁去交赎金
<4-12,GATES>If the police aren't involved, then who's making the drop?

95
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,330
<4-13,ANWAR>我妻子的妹妹住在巴黎
<4-13,ANWAR>My wife has a sister living in paris.

96
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,970
<4-13,ANWAR>她的丈夫会去赎人
<4-13,ANWAR>Her husband will do the exchange.

97
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,140
<4-13,ANWAR>失陪了  我们有很多电话要打
<4-13,ANWAR>Now if you'll excuse us, we have many calls to make.

98
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,070
<4-14,CASTLE>谢谢
<4-14,CASTLE>Thank you.

99
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,670
<4-15,ANWAR>只能祈祷这些人言而有信了
<4-15,ANWAR>Just pray these men are honorable.

100
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,510
<4-16,HARRIS>塞纳河那段有监控摄像头
<4-16,HARRIS>There are security cameras covering that portion of the Seine.

101
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,890
<4-16,HARRIS>至少我们可以调出画面
<4-16,HARRIS>At the very least, maybe we can get a tap in,

102
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,250
<4-16,HARRIS>看看绑架犯是谁
<4-16,HARRIS>see who these guys are.

103
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,160
<5-1,TECH GUY>长官  有实时画面了
<5-1,TECH GUY>Sir, we're live.

104
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,990
<5-2,HARRIS>有动静吗
<5-2,HARRIS>Any activity?

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,580
<5-3,TECH GUY>目前没有
<5-3,TECH GUY>It looks deserted so far.

106
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,460
<5-3,TECH GUY>那里
<5-3,TECH GUY>There.

107
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,050
<5-4,HARRIS>能推近镜头吗
<5-4,HARRIS>Can you get any closer?

108
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
<5-5,LINA>就是他  这是艾哈迈德
<5-5,LINA>That's him. That's Ahmed.

109
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,140
<5-6,CASTLE>看起来好不真实
<5-6,CASTLE>This doesn't even seem real.

110
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,580
<5-6,CASTLE>就像电视节目
<5-6,CASTLE>It's like some kind of show.

119
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,820
<5-6,CASTLE>艾哈迈德
<5-6,CASTLE>Ahmed!

120
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,420
<5-8,HARRIS>给巴黎警方打电话  快
<5-8,HARRIS>Get the Paris police on the phone. Now.

121
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,510
<5-9,ANWAR>不不不  等等
<5-9,ANWAR>No, no, no, no! Wait. Wait.

122
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,260
<5-10,LINA>不要啊
<5-10,LINA>No. No!

123
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,610
<5-11,CASTLE>她们在哪  孩子们在哪
<5-11,CASTLE>Where-- where are they? Where are the girls?

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,070
<5-12,ANWAR>他找到她了  她安全了
<5-12,ANWAR>He has her. She's safe.

125
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,500
<5-12,ANWAR>阿丽克西斯呢
<5-12,ANWAR>Where's Alexis?

126
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,060
<6-1,BECKETT>哈里斯探员刚问过莎拉
<6-1,BECKETT>Agent Harris just spoke with Sara.

127
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,050
<6-1,BECKETT>她说那次企图逃跑之后她俩就失散了
<6-1,BECKETT>She and Alexis were separated after the escape attempt.

128
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,260
<6-1,BECKETT>那是她最后一次见到阿丽克西斯
<6-1,BECKETT>And that was the last time that she saw her.

129
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
<6-2,CASTLE>他们已经得其所愿  她没价值了
<6-2,CASTLE>They got what they wanted. She's of no value anymore.

130
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,510
<6-3,BECKETT>你并不确定
<6-3,BECKETT>You don't know that.

131
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,130
<6-4,CASTLE>我确定
<6-4,CASTLE>Yes, I do.

132
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,560
<6-5,BECKETT>你去哪
<6-5,BECKETT>Where you going?

133
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,780
<6-6,CASTLE>告诉我妈妈  她还不知道
<6-6,CASTLE>To tell my mother. She doesn't know yet.

134
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,690
<6-7,BECKETT>我跟你去
<6-7,BECKETT>I'll go with.

135
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,730
<5-10,LINA>不用了
<5-10,LINA>No.

136
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,420
<5-10,LINA>我要自己来
<5-10,LINA>I need to do this alone.

137
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,500
<5-10,LINA>也许卡塞尔说得对
<5-10,LINA>Castle may be right.

138
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,290
<7-1,HARRIS>莎拉才是目标
<7-1,HARRIS>Sara was the objective.

139
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,230
<7-1,HARRIS>阿丽克西斯现在是拖油瓶了
<7-1,HARRIS>Alexis is just a liability now.

140
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,970
<7-2,BECKETT>那他们为什么不一起放了她
<7-2,BECKETT>Then why didn't they bring her to the exchange?

141
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,510
<7-3,HARRIS>跟当初绑架她是一个道理  她是谈判的筹码
<7-3,HARRIS>The same reason they took her-- a bargaining chip,

142
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,320
<7-3,HARRIS>万一出什么事  她可以保他们平安
<7-3,HARRIS>insurance in case something went wrong.

143
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,270
<7-4,GATES>现在他们已经不需要她了
<7-4,GATES>Insurance they don't need anymore.

144
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,210
<7-5,HARRIS>我们会继续追查
<7-5,HARRIS>We'll keep moving forward.

145
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,160
<7-5,HARRIS>但也不能抱太大希望
<7-5,HARRIS>But we have to manage expectations now.

146
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,810
<7-6,BECKETT>哈里斯探员  我不会降低期望的
<7-6,BECKETT>Agent Harris, I'm not gonna manage expectations.

147
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,330
<7-6,BECKETT>我会去破一件凶杀案
<7-6,BECKETT>I'll be solving a murder.

148
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,170
<7-6,BECKETT>绑架两个女孩的人  罗杰·汉森
<7-6,BECKETT>The girls' kidnapper Roger Henson

149
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,410
<7-6,BECKETT>在死前曾受到折磨
<7-6,BECKETT>was tortured and killed,

150
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,980
<7-6,BECKETT>很可能是雇佣他的人干的
<7-6,BECKETT>most likely be the people that hired him.

151
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,450
<7-6,BECKETT>找到那些人  就能找到阿丽克西斯
<7-6,BECKETT>We find those people, we will find Alexis.

152
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,700
<8-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  又是我
<8-1,BECKETT>Castle, it's me again.

<10-4,ESPOSITO>连姆·尼森  他连艾什莉·贾德都比不上
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Liam Neeson? The dude's barely Ashley Judd.

212
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,280
<10-5,BECKETT>以他现在的状态  谁知道会干出什么来
<10-5,BECKETT>Look, in the state that he's in, who knows what he's capable of?

213
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,580
<10-5,BECKETT>但他说他认识帮得上忙的人
<10-5,BECKETT>But he says that he knows someone that can help.

00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,000
<10-6,ESPOSITO>你要去找他吗
<10-6,ESPOSITO>You gonna go after him?

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,520
<10-7,BECKETT>浪费一整天飞过去

216
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,910
<10-7,BECKETT>再浪费一整天
<10-7,BECKETT>and another one tracking him down

217
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,080
<10-7,BECKETT>在一个我无权无势的地方找他
<10-7,BECKETT>in a place that I don't have jurisdiction or authority?

218
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,090
<10-7,BECKETT>不

<10-7,BECKETT>我要做警察该做的
<10-7,BECKETT>And... I have to act like a cop.

222
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,390
<10-7,BECKETT>你们能再去找一下联调局
<10-7,BECKETT>Can you circle back with the Feds?

223
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,660
<10-7,BECKETT>让他们扩大搜索  查找所有
<10-7,BECKETT>Have 'em widen the search to any private jets

224
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,890
<10-7,BECKETT>飞入欧洲的私人飞机
<10-7,BECKETT>flying out to anywhere in Europe.

225
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,990
<10-7,BECKETT>莱恩  罗杰·汉森我查不下去了
<10-7,BECKETT>And, Ryan, I'm hitting a wall with Roger Henson.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,970
<10-7,BECKETT>你可以问问你缉毒组的老朋友吗
<10-7,BECKETT>You think you can reach out to your guys in narcotics?

227
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,290
<10-7,BECKETT>或许他们知道些传闻
<10-7,BECKETT>Maybe they heard something on the streets.

228
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,210
<10-8,RYAN>好
<10-8,RYAN>Yeah.

229
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,470
<10-9,BECKETT>我不知道卡塞尔以为自己认识谁
<10-9,BECKETT>Look, you guys, I don't know who Castle thinks he knows.

230
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,190
<10-9,BECKETT>但是我们得先找到他女儿
<10-9,BECKETT>But let's find his daughter

231
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,940
<10-9,BECKETT>免得他做出什么蠢事害死自己
<10-9,BECKETT>before he does something stupid and gets himself killed.

<12-2,CASTLE>你还给国防部做顾问  对吗
<12-2,CASTLE>You're still working as an advisor to the minister of defense, right?

239
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,020
<12-3,GASTON>对  但我跟警察没什么交情
<12-3,GASTON>Yes, but that gives me very little pull with the police nationale.

240
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,410
<12-3,GASTON>但是我能帮你问问
<12-3,GASTON>Uh, I could make inquiries, though.

<12-4,CASTLE>德里克里·斯道姆小说做顾问时
<12-4,CASTLE>on those last few Derrick Storm novels,

245
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,950
<12-4,CASTLE>曾提到一个法国政府无法进行正式行动时
<12-4,CASTLE>you mentioned a man that the french government would sometimes hire

246
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,160
<12-4,CASTLE>便会雇佣的人
<12-4,CASTLE>when they couldn't afford to take official action.

247
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,000
<12-5,GASTON>里奇  那是悄悄话
<12-5,GASTON>Ricky, I told you that in confidence.

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,730
<12-6,CASTLE>他是真有其人吗
<12-6,CASTLE>But he exists?

249
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,370
<12-7,GASTON>坐在你桌子后面安全地写书
<12-7,GASTON>It is one thing to write about these characters

250
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,310
<12-7,GASTON>那是一回事
<12-7,GASTON>from the safety of your own desk.

251
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
<12-7,GASTON>但这样的人
<12-7,GASTON>But men like this,

252
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,970
<12-7,GASTON>你不会想认识他们这种人
<12-7,GASTON>they are not the kind of people you ever want to know.

253
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,610

255
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,930
<12-8,CASTLE>我想让你想想
<12-8,CASTLE>I want you to think about how it feels

256
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,000
<12-8,CASTLE>你抱着她们的感觉
<12-8,CASTLE>when you hug them,

258
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,580
<12-8,CASTLE>现在想想她们失踪的感觉
<12-8,CASTLE>And now imagine them gone.

260
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,140

280
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,740
<13-7,BECKETT>没关系
<13-7,BECKETT>He's not.

281
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,330
<13-8,ESPOSITO>其实他可能根本毫无牵连
<13-8,ESPOSITO>In fact, it's possible he's not even involved.

282
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,760
<13-8,ESPOSITO>他的飞机是在巴黎维修
<13-8,ESPOSITO>His plane was in Paris under repairs.

283
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,350
<13-8,ESPOSITO>他的人根本不知道飞机被盗了
<13-8,ESPOSITO>And none of his people even knew it was taken.

284
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,830
<13-9,GATES>他们偷了架飞机
<13-9,GATES>These people stole a jet?

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,010
<13-10,BECKETT>就为了个人质交换
<13-10,BECKETT>For a simple hostage exchange?

286
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,120
<13-10,BECKETT>这说不通啊
<13-10,BECKETT>That doesn't add up.

<13-11,RYAN>我跟我缉毒组的人谈过了
<13-11,RYAN>Hey, so I talked to my guys in narcotics.

288
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,360
<13-11,RYAN>他们似乎并不知道
<13-11,RYAN>Now they didn't seem to know much

289
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,090
<13-11,RYAN>汉森最近都做了什么

291
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,200
<13-11,RYAN>但他们知道我们不知道的
<13-11,RYAN>but they did know something that we didn't.

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,630
<13-11,RYAN>汉森有个女朋友
<13-11,RYAN>Henson had a girlfriend.

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,530
<14-5,HENRI>那是我难以掌控的
<14-5,HENRI>That, I'm afraid, is out of my control.

306
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,010
<18-2,BECKETT>这些人雇他绑架这些姑娘们
<18-2,BECKETT>These people hired him to kidnap those girls.

394
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,310
<18-2,BECKETT>那他们为什么拷打杀掉他
<18-2,BECKETT>So why would they torture and murder him?

395
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,130
<18-2,BECKETT>为什么把这里翻个底朝天
<18-2,BECKETT>Why would they toss this place?

396
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,500
<18-3,ESPOSITO>或许不是同一帮人干的
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Maybe it wasn't the same guys.

397
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,120
<18-4,BECKETT>还会是谁
<18-4,BECKETT>Who else is it gonna be?

398
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,060
<18-4,BECKETT>去拜访一下街坊邻居  问问他们看到什么
<18-4,BECKETT>Check with the neighbors. See if they saw anything.

399
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,980
<18-5,ESPOSITO>好
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

400
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,910
<18-6,RYAN>贝克特  电脑
<18-6,RYAN>Beckett, computer.

401
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,000
<18-7,BECKETT>交给技术部
<18-7,BECKETT>Get it to Tech.

402
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,970
<18-7,BECKETT>让他们仔细研究  给我点线索
<18-7,BECKETT>Have them tear it apart. Find me something,

403
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,880
<18-7,BECKETT>什么都行
<18-7,BECKETT>Anything.

404
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,690
<18-7,BECKETT>怎么了
<18-7,BECKETT>What's going on?

405
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,840
<19-1,CASTLE>你有所发现了吗
<19-1,CASTLE>You found something?

406
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,160
<19-1,CASTLE>或许吧
<19-1,CASTLE>Maybe.

407
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,510
<19-2,HENRI>吸音板
<19-2,HENRI>Acoustic tiles,

408
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,640
<19-2,HENRI>办公地点  接近屋顶
<19-2,HENRI>office space, close to a rooftop--

409
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,400
<19-2,HENRI>可能找到地方了
<19-2,HENRI>Might fill the bill.

410
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,100
<19-3,CASTLE>我也去
<19-3,CASTLE>I'm coming.

411
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,200
<19-4,HENRI>不不不  可能不是那地方
<19-4,HENRI>No, no, no. It might not be the place.

412
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,930
<19-5,CASTLE>我不介意
<19-5,CASTLE>I don't care.

413
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,300
<19-6,HENRI>可能就是那地方
<19-6,HENRI>It could be the place.

414
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,190
<19-7,CASTLE>我女儿  我付钱
<19-7,CASTLE>My daughter, my money.

415
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,360
<19-7,CASTLE>我要去
<19-7,CASTLE>I'm coming.

416
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,200
<20-1,CASTLE>他们就关在这儿
<20-1,CASTLE>They were here.

417
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,180
<20-2,HENRI>现在不在了
<20-2,HENRI>Not anymore.

418
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,420
<20-2,HENRI>这不是一般绑匪的手法
<20-2,HENRI>This is not the work of typical kidnappers.

419
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,320
<21-1,HENRI>清理得很干净
<21-1,HENRI>The place is clean.

420
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
<21-1,HENRI>太干净了
<21-1,HENRI>It's too clean.

421
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,630
<21-1,HENRI>这是情报人员的手法
<21-1,HENRI>This is tradecraft.

422
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,460
<21-2,CASTLE>你说的是间谍吗
<21-2,CASTLE>Tradecraft as in spies?

423
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,180
<21-3,HENRI>干这事的人一定受过情报训练
<21-3,HENRI>Whoever is behind this has intelligence training.

424
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,170
<21-3,HENRI>他们没留丝毫线索
<21-3,HENRI>They left no trace.

425
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,510
<21-4,CASTLE>那我们怎么找
<21-4,CASTLE>So how do we find 'em?

426
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,220
<21-5,CASTLE>你说你可以找到他们
<21-5,CASTLE>You said you could find them--

427
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,720
<21-6,HENRI>他们在监听
<21-6,HENRI>They're listening.

428
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,290
<21-7,HENRI>如果警察查到这儿了
<21-7,HENRI>So if the cops find this place,

429
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,340
<21-7,HENRI>他们仍可以快警察一步
<21-7,HENRI>they stay ahead of the investigation.

430
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,610
<21-8,CASTLE>到底是什么人
<21-8,CASTLE>Who are these people?

431
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,800
<21-9,HENRI>我们来查查
<21-9,HENRI>Let's find out.

432
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,230
<21-9,HENRI>我知道你在
<21-9,HENRI>I know you're out there.

433
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,720
<21-10,HENRI>我知道你在听  所以知道我不是警察
<21-10,HENRI>I know you're listening, so you know I'm not a cop.

434
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,210
<21-10,HENRI>我对你  你的理由以及法律都没兴趣
<21-10,HENRI>I'm not interested in you, your cause, or the law.

435
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,640
<21-10,HENRI>我们只要那女孩
<21-10,HENRI>All we want is the girl.

436
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,690
<21-10,HENRI>你已经得到你要的了
<21-10,HENRI>You got what you wanted.

437
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,980
<21-10,HENRI>她现在对你没意义了  但对我却不是
<21-10,HENRI>Now she's meaningless to you, but not to me.

438
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,630
<21-10,HENRI>所以你要是聪明的  就打过来
<21-10,HENRI>So if you're smart, you call,

439
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,490
<21-10,HENRI>我们谈谈价钱
<21-10,HENRI>we discuss terms.

440
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,920
<21-10,HENRI>但你要是犯傻
<21-10,HENRI>But if you are stupid,

441
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,270
<21-10,HENRI>那我就会来找你
<21-10,HENRI>then I will come for you.

442
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,260
<21-10,HENRI>但愿你有声音识别系统
<21-10,HENRI>I expect by now you have run voice recognition,

443
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,500
<21-10,HENRI>这样你就知道我是谁  我可是出了名的
<21-10,HENRI>so you know who I am, you know my reputation,

444
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,310
<21-10,HENRI>让我找到你  就让你见识我的厉害
<21-10,HENRI>and you know what I will do when I find you.

445
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,580
<21-10,HENRI>选择权在你手上
<21-10,HENRI>The choice is yours.

446
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,650
<21-10,HENRI>喂
<21-10,HENRI>Oui.

447
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,620
<15-7,HENRI>绿色走廊  七点钟[法语]
<15-7,HENRI>La coulee verte, sept huers.

448
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,040
<15-7,HENRI>一个人来[法语]
<15-7,HENRI>Venez seul.

449
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,950
<15-7,HENRI>别带她爹来[法语]
<15-7,HENRI>Sans la pare.

450
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,190
<15-7,HENRI>他是在说
<15-7,HENRI>"Sans la pere"?

451
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,260
<22-1,CASTLE>"别带她爹来"吗
<22-1,CASTLE>Without the father?

452
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,450
<22-2,HENRI>你不觉得这是好事吗
<22-2,HENRI>Don't you see? This is good news.

453
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,260
<22-2,HENRI>他们想谈判  这说明她处境安全
<22-2,HENRI>They want to negotiate. It means she's safe.

454
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,790
<22-3,CASTLE>你不能不带我去谈判
<22-3,CASTLE>You're not having that meeting without me.

455
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,220
<22-3,CASTLE>你情绪不稳定
<22-3,CASTLE>You are emotionally compromised.

456
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,980
<22-4,HENRI>这会让他们觉得你像只野兽
<22-4,HENRI>that makes you like an animal to them--

457
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,870
<22-4,HENRI>危险而无法预测
<22-4,HENRI>Unpredictable and dangerous.

458
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,860
<22-4,HENRI>卡塞尔先生
<22-4,HENRI>Monsieur Castle...

459
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,060
<22-4,HENRI>我就是干这个的
<22-4,HENRI>This is what I do.

460
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,050
<22-4,HENRI>这就是你雇我的原因
<22-4,HENRI>It's what you pay me for.

461
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,580
<22-4,HENRI>让我去见他们
<22-4,HENRI>Now let me meet with them.

462
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,320
<22-4,HENRI>让我去和他们谈价钱吧
<22-4,HENRI>Let me negotiate the terms.

463
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,150
<22-5,HENRI>当然  他们会要更多的钱
<22-5,HENRI>Oh, and of course they will ask for more money.

464
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,730
<22-5,HENRI>我想知道
<22-5,HENRI>I need to know...

465
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,250
<22-5,HENRI>你能付多少
<22-5,HENRI>How much can you afford?

466
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,120
<22-5,HENRI>贝克特
<22-5,HENRI>Yo, Beckett.

467
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,350
<23-1,ESPOSITO>亨森的邻居看见有人从他家出来
<23-1,ESPOSITO>One of Henson's neighbors saw someone leaving his apartment

<23-1,ESPOSITO>We just got the sketch.

470
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,810
<23-1,ESPOSITO>正是那个从亨森死亡的农场
<23-1,ESPOSITO>That's the same dude who was spotted leaving the farmhouse

471
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,380
<23-1,ESPOSITO>走出来的人
<23-1,ESPOSITO>where Henson's body was found.

472
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,550
<23-2,BECKETT>他先是拷打了亨森
<23-2,BECKETT>First he tortures Henson,

473
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,240
<23-2,BECKETT>然后又搜遍了他家  这是为何
<23-2,BECKETT>and then he trashes his place. Why?

474
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,190
<23-2,BECKETT>亨森的硬盘处理得怎样了
<23-2,BECKETT>Where are you with Henson's hard drive?

475
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,360
<23-3,TECH GUY>全被删掉了
<23-3,TECH GUY>It's been erased,

476
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,790
<23-3,TECH GUY>只剩下应用程序
<23-3,TECH GUY>and not with commercial software.

477
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,560
<23-4,BECKETT>你能提取出信息吗
<23-4,BECKETT>Were you able to pull anything from it?

478
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,490
<23-5,TECH GUY>我尽力吧
<23-5,TECH GUY>I'll do what I can,

479
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,950
<23-5,TECH GUY>但你别抱太大希望
<23-5,TECH GUY>but I wouldn't get your hopes up.

480
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,600
<23-6,BECKETT>去吧  我们得查出他想找什么
<23-6,BECKETT>Do it. We gotta figure out what he was looking for.

481
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,610
<24-1,THE MOLE>别担心
<24-1,THE MOLE>Don't worry.

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,500
<24-1,THE MOLE>亨利总是能搞定
<24-1,THE MOLE>Henri always comes through.

483
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,640
<24-2,CASTLE>他怎么还没回来
<24-2,CASTLE>Shouldn't he be back by now?

484
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,770
<24-3,THE MOLE>回来了
<24-3,THE MOLE>He is.

485
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,670
<24-4,CASTLE>她在那儿吗

488
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,330
<24-6,CASTLE>他们为什么要抓她
<24-6,CASTLE>Why did they take her?

489
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,940
<24-7,HENRI>顺手抓的  但他们同意放了她
<24-7,HENRI>It was convenient, but they've agreed to let her go.

<25-1,TECH GUY>贝克特探长

<26-2,BECKETT>Oh, god. Alexis.

497
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,160
<26-2,BECKETT>她不是在错的时间出现在错的地点
<26-2,BECKETT>She wasn't at the wrong place at the wrong time.

498
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,450
<26-2,BECKETT>她本来就是目标
<26-2,BECKETT>She was the target.

<26-2,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯在哪儿  我没见到她
<26-2,BECKETT>Where's Alexis? I don't see her.

<27-5,CASTLE>你出卖我  为什么
<27-5,CASTLE>You're selling me out? Why?

506
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,410
<27-6,HENRI>为了保命  我只好背信弃义
<27-6,HENRI>I value my life more than my word.

507
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,720
<27-6,HENRI>如果我知道是谁绑架了你的女儿
<27-6,HENRI>If I had known who was really holding your daughter,

508
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,910
<27-6,HENRI>知道你女儿是谁
<27-6,HENRI>who your daughter really is...

<27-8,HENRI>我根本不会接下这份活儿
<27-8,HENRI>I would never have taken the job.

511
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,870
<27-9,CASTLE>她只是个普通人
<27-9,CASTLE>She's nobody.

<27-11,CASTLE>Just... what do you want?

516
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,360
<27-13,HUNT>如果我要你死
<27-13,HUNT>If I'd wanted you dead,

517
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,550
<27-13,HUNT>你早死了
<27-13,HUNT>You'd be dead.

518
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,930
<27-14,CASTLE>你就是画像上的人  你去过农场
<27-14,CASTLE>You're the guy in the sketch. You were at the farmhouse.

519
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,060
<27-14,CASTLE>没错
<27-14,CASTLE>That's right.

520
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,490
<27-15,HUNT>你那朋友很厉害
<27-15,HUNT>Your friend there was pretty good,

521
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,470
<27-15,HUNT>但是对付这些人还是不够火候
<27-15,HUNT>but a bit out of his league.

522
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,870
<27-15,HUNT>我一点也不奇怪他会出卖你
<27-15,HUNT>I am not surprised that he crossed to the other side.

523
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,960
<27-16,CASTLE>你知道这到底是怎么回事
<27-16,CASTLE>You know what's going on here?

<27-20,CASTLE>No, not until you tell me what's going on.

530
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,390
<27-20,CASTLE>贝克特  真高兴你打来了
<27-20,CASTLE>Beckett, I am so glad you called.

531
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,890
<27-21,BECKETT>卡塞尔  阿丽克西斯不是顺带被绑走的
<27-21,BECKETT>Castle, Alexis wasn't taken by accident.

532
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,290
<27-21,BECKETT>她才是真正的目标  他们要绑架的是她
<27-21,BECKETT>She was the target. They wanted her.

533
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,030
<27-22,CASTLE>听我说  我
<27-22,CASTLE>Listen, i--

<27-23,CASTLE>你这是干嘛  那部手机要200块呢
<27-23,CASTLE>What are you doing?! That was a $200 phone.

535
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,580
<27-24,HUNT>他们就是用手机来追踪你的
<27-24,HUNT>And that's how they track you.

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,840
<27-24,HUNT>现在赶紧给我上车

<27-26,HUNT>别傻了  我是好人
<27-26,HUNT>Oh, don't be an idiot. I'm the good guy.

539
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,670
<27-27,CASTLE>你觉得我会相信你吗
<27-27,CASTLE>Oh, you expect me to trust you?

540
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,380

542
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,590
<27-28,HUNT>跟这群死人待在这里吗
<27-28,HUNT>Stay out here in the woods with all the dead guys?

543
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,560
<27-29,CASTLE>好吧

00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,620
<27-29,CASTLE>我上车
<27-29,CASTLE>I'll get in the car.

545
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,770
<27-30,HUNT>考虑到你对那200块钱的手机
<27-30,HUNT>Given how you're feeling so bad

546
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,250
<27-30,HUNT>都心疼的要命
<27-30,HUNT>about your 200-buck phone,

547
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,430
<27-30,HUNT>你还是把那装了300万美元的箱子捡起来吧
<27-30,HUNT>You might want to pick up that $3-million briefcase.

548
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,450
<27-31,HUNT>别弄丢了
<27-31,HUNT>Take it with you.

<27-33,HUNT>亨特  杰克森·亨特
<27-33,HUNT>Hunt. Jackson Hunt.

551
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,690
<27-34,CASTLE>像是个假名字
<27-34,CASTLE>That sounds made up.

552
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,290
<27-35,HUNT>是假的
<27-35,HUNT>It is.

553
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,340
<28-1,ALEXIS>能不能告诉我这到底是怎么回事儿
<28-1,ALEXIS>Hey, could someone just please tell me what's going on?

554
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,560
<28-1,ALEXIS>为什么我会在这儿

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,920
<29-1,HUNT>这里暂时是安全的
<29-1,HUNT>We should be safe here for now.

556
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,960
<29-2,CASTLE>你从哪弄到的这些
<29-2,CASTLE>Where did you get these?

557
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,590
<29-3,HUNT>这不重要
<29-3,HUNT>That's not important.

558
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,670
<29-3,HUNT>重要的是我们得把她救出来
<29-3,HUNT>You know what's important, is we get her back.

559
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,690
<29-4,CASTLE>我根本都不认识你  这关你什么事
<29-4,CASTLE>Well, I don't even know you. Why would you care?

560
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,210
<29-5,HUNT>这是我的任务  我是受命于人
<29-5,HUNT>It's my job. I was sent.

561
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,660
<29-6,CASTLE>受命于谁  艾尔玛一家吗
<29-6,CASTLE>By whom, the El-masris?

562
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,570
<29-7,HUNT>管他是谁呢
<29-7,HUNT>What's the difference?

563
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,990
<29-8,CASTLE>你得告诉我是谁雇佣了你
<29-8,CASTLE>You need to tell me who hired you

564
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,090
<29-8,CASTLE>还有这些人为什么要绑走我的女儿
<29-8,CASTLE>and why these people took my daughter.

565
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,090
<29-8,CASTLE>找你的
<29-8,CASTLE>That's yours.

566
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,710
<29-9,HUNT>你不接吗
<29-9,HUNT>You want to get it?

567
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,850
<29-10,CASTLE>怎么会是找我的  你已经把我的打烂了
<29-10,CASTLE>How is it mine? You shot mine.

<29-11,HUNT>我复制了一个  我就是这样找到你的
<29-11,HUNT>It's a clone. That's how I tracked you.

569
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,320
<29-11,HUNT>它们的区别是这部手机是安全的
<29-11,HUNT>The difference is that that one's secure.

570
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,690
<29-11,HUNT>可能是贝克特打来的
<29-11,HUNT>It's probably Beckett.

571
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,540
<29-12,HUNT>你应该让她知道你安全了
<29-12,HUNT>You ought to let her know you're safe.

572
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,970
<29-13,CASTLE>不是贝克特  是当地的号码
<29-13,CASTLE>It's not Beckett. It's a local number.

573
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,800
<29-13,CASTLE>是阿丽克西斯
<29-13,CASTLE>Alexis.

574
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,240
<29-13,CASTLE>是阿丽克西斯吗
<29-13,CASTLE>Alexis?

575
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,320
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>不是的  卡塞尔先生
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>I'm afraid not, Mr. Castle.

576
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,460
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>不过她在我手里
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>But I am the one holding her.

577
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,690
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>如果你还在意她的生命的话
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>If you value her life,

578
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,570
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>你最好把电话交给站在你身边的那个人
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>you will give the phone to the man standing next to you,

579
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,170
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>那个在树林里大开杀戒的人
<29-14,GREGOR VOLKOV>the one responsible for all the bloodshed in the woods.

580
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,740
<29-15,HUNT>什么事

<29-16,VOLKOV>这么多年  我终于找到你了
<29-16,VOLKOV>After all these years, it's finally you.

583
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,110
<29-17,HUNT>你该放她走了  霍尔科夫
<29-17,HUNT>Time to let her go, Volkov.

584
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,180
<29-18,VOLKOV>就像你放走安娜吗
<29-18,VOLKOV>The way you let Anna go?

585
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,740
<29-18,VOLKOV>不  是时候了结这一切了
<29-18,VOLKOV>No. It's time to end things.

586
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,140
<29-18,VOLKOV>一命
<29-18,VOLKOV>A life

587
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,950
<29-18,VOLKOV>抵一命
<29-18,VOLKOV>for a life.

588
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,800
<29-18,VOLKOV>明天早晨6点
<29-18,VOLKOV>Tomorrow, 6:00 a.m.

00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,220
<29-18,VOLKOV>波旁宫外面
<29-18,VOLKOV>Outside the Palais Bourbon.

590
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,200
<30-20,CASTLE>如果你来  我就饶了她
<30-20,CASTLE>If you show, I'll spare her.

591
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,430
<30-20,CASTLE>但如果你不来
<30-20,CASTLE>But if you don't,

592
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,680
<29-17,HUNT>我就会杀了她
<29-17,HUNT>I will put a bullet in her brain instead of yours,

593
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,890
<29-18,VOLKOV>然后我们重新开始
<29-18,VOLKOV>and we start again.

594
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,640
<29-19,CASTLE>这一切都因为你
<29-19,CASTLE>This is about you?

595
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,320
<29-20,HUNT>是的
<29-20,HUNT>Yeah.

596
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,210
<29-20,HUNT>我不明白
<29-20,HUNT>I don't understand.

597
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,540
<29-21,CASTLE>这跟阿丽克西斯有什么关系
<29-21,CASTLE>What does this have to do with Alexis?

598
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,700
<29-21,CASTLE>他们为什么要抓她
<29-21,CASTLE>Why would they take her?

599
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,330
<29-22,HUNT>因为我大意了
<29-22,HUNT>Because I was careless.

600
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,670
<29-22,HUNT>不知他通过什么方法
<29-22,HUNT>Because somehow he found out

601
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,680
<29-22,HUNT>知道了她和你的身份
<29-22,HUNT>who she was, who you were,

602
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,060
<29-22,HUNT>而且他还知道我会为她挺身而出的
<29-22,HUNT>and he knew I'd come for her.

603
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,650
<29-23,CASTLE>为什么  为什么你会为她挺身而出
<29-23,CASTLE>Why? Why would you come for her?

604
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,450
<29-24,HUNT>因为她是我的孙女
<29-24,HUNT>Because she's my granddaughter.

605
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,830
<29-24,HUNT>理查德
<29-24,HUNT>Richard,

606
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,940
<29-25,HUNT>我是你父亲
<29-25,HUNT>I'm your father.

607
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,350
<30-1,CASTLE>你是说你是个间谍
<30-1,CASTLE>You're telling me you're a spy?

608
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,010
<30-2,HUNT>应该说是"情报特工"
<30-2,HUNT>"Intelligence asset" is the term.

609
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,680
<30-3,CASTLE>我老爸是个间谍
<30-3,CASTLE>My dad's a spy.

610
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,970
<30-3,CASTLE>我妈知道吗
<30-3,CASTLE>Does my mom know?

611
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,780
<30-4,HUNT>她是怎么跟你说我的
<30-4,HUNT>What did she tell you about me?

612
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,920
<30-5,CASTLE>她说那是个很特别的夜晚
<30-5,CASTLE>Uh, that it was a special night.

613
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,080
<30-5,CASTLE>她坠入了爱河
<30-5,CASTLE>She was in love.

614
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,320
<30-5,CASTLE>第二天她醒来时  你已经走了
<30-5,CASTLE>She woke up the next morning, you were gone.

615
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,790
<30-5,CASTLE>她再也没有见过你
<30-5,CASTLE>She never saw you again.

616
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,060
<30-5,CASTLE>是啊  那天晚上
<30-5,CASTLE>Yeah, that night,

617
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,980
<30-6,HUNT>我刚在联合国完成了一项任务
<30-6,HUNT>I had just finished a job at the U.N.

618
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,410
<30-6,HUNT>至少我认为我完成了
<30-6,HUNT>Least I thought I had.

619
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,020
<30-6,HUNT>但第二天  形势急转直下
<30-6,HUNT>And the next day, things went south.

620
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,260
<30-6,HUNT>我不得不赶紧离开
<30-6,HUNT>I had to get out of the city fast.

621
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,810
<30-6,HUNT>一年之后我才回国
<30-6,HUNT>It was a year before I was stateside again.

622
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,000
<30-6,HUNT>那时我才知道有了你
<30-6,HUNT>That's when I found out about you.

<30-7,CASTLE>而你却从来不曾现身
<30-7,CASTLE>and you never once let us know you were out there?

626
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:19,530
<30-8,HUNT>我的工作就是不能与任何人
<30-8,HUNT>What I do means no communication,

631
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,130

<30-8,HUNT>你妈妈带你去图书馆
<30-8,HUNT>Your mother took you to the library,

633
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,970
<30-8,HUNT>当时你正在找一本书
<30-8,HUNT>and you were looking for a book and, uh,

634
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,330
<30-8,HUNT>我给了你一本

<30-12,CASTLE>是那本书让我立志成为一名作家
<30-12,CASTLE>That book made me want to become a writer.

639
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,450
<30-13,HUNT>我看到你的第一本间谍小说时简直不敢相信
<30-13,HUNT>I couldn't believe it when I read your first spy novel.

640
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,330
<30-14,CASTLE>你还看过我的书
<30-14,CASTLE>You read my books?

641

642
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,750

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,060
<30-15,HUNT>我还帮了点忙呢
<30-15,HUNT>to some information for research.

644
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,810
<30-15,HUNT>虽然微不足道
<30-15,HUNT>I know that's not much,

645
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,450
<30-15,HUNT>但那让我...
<30-15,HUNT>But for a minute there...

646
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,090
<30-15,HUNT>让我有一种为人父的感觉
<30-15,HUNT>It made me feel like a father.

<30-15,HUNT>我也关心你  关心你妈妈
<30-15,HUNT>No, I've been, uh, checking on you and your mom

648

<13-2,BECKETT>还有阿丽克西斯
<13-2,BECKETT>and Alexis

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,180
<30-15,HUNT>关注着你的一生
<30-15,HUNT>your whole lives.

650
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,870
<30-16,CASTLE>绑架我女儿的人  他是谁
<30-16,CASTLE>This man who has my daughter, who is he?

651
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,000
<30-17,HUNT>乔治·霍尔科夫
<30-17,HUNT>Gregor Volkov?

652
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,950
<30-17,HUNT>克格勃最令人畏惧的特工
<30-17,HUNT>The K.G.B.'s most feared agent.

653
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,140
<30-17,HUNT>我杀了他的妻子安娜
<30-17,HUNT>I killed his wife Anna,

654
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,650
<30-17,HUNT>是一次反情报行动
<30-17,HUNT>a counter-intelligence operative,

655
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,490
<30-17,HUNT>12年前就在巴黎
<30-17,HUNT>12 years ago in an operation here in Paris.

656
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,920
<30-17,HUNT>他第一次追杀我时
<30-17,HUNT>The first time he came after me,

657
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,440
<30-17,HUNT>我把他关进了车臣的监狱  终生监禁
<30-17,HUNT>I put him away in a Chechen prison for life.

658
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,570
<30-17,HUNT>而他逃了出来
<30-17,HUNT>Then... he escaped.

659
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,070
<30-17,HUNT>此后  他就想尽办法
<30-17,HUNT>And he's been trying to figure out a way

660
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,850
<30-17,HUNT>要把我揪出来
<30-17,HUNT>to draw me out ever since.

661
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,540
<30-18,CASTLE>如果这是针对阿丽克西斯
<30-18,CASTLE>If this was about Alexis,

662
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,050
<30-18,CASTLE>为什么还要带走另一个女孩
<30-18,CASTLE>why would he take the other girl?

663
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,810
<30-19,HUNT>因为如果他只抓走阿丽克西斯
<30-19,HUNT>Because if he just took Alexis,

664
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,120
<30-19,HUNT>这就不会成为国际新闻
<30-19,HUNT>it wouldn't be international news.

665
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,580
<30-19,HUNT>他需要位高权重的人  他要让我知道
<30-19,HUNT>He needed somebody high-profile. He needed me to know.

666
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,240
<30-19,HUNT>现在他已得偿所愿找到我了
<30-19,HUNT>And now he's got me exactly where he wants me.

667
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,600
<30-19,HUNT>如果我明天不出现  他就会杀了她
<30-19,HUNT>If I don't show up tomorrow, he will kill her.

668
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,920
<30-20,CASTLE>如果你出现会怎样
<30-20,CASTLE>And if you do show up?

669
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,660
<30-21,HUNT>他会杀了我们两个取乐
<30-21,HUNT>He'll kill us both just for fun.

670
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,940
<30-22,CASTLE>如果你了解我  你知道我会不顾一切
<30-22,CASTLE>If you know me at all, you know I'll do anything.

671
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,420
<30-23,HUNT>那我们唯一的优势就是
<30-23,HUNT>Then our only advantage is

672
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,440
<30-23,HUNT>霍尔科夫不知道我已经找到他了
<30-23,HUNT>Volkov doesn't know I've found him.

673
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,800
<30-23,HUNT>他可能会对直接袭击猝不及防
<30-23,HUNT>He may not be prepared for a direct assault.

674
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,520
<30-23,HUNT>如果我能进入他的地盘
<30-23,HUNT>If I can get inside his compound,

675
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,980
<30-23,HUNT>我就能救阿丽克西斯出来
<30-23,HUNT>I can get Alexis out.

676
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,220
<30-24,CASTLE>直接袭击
<30-24,CASTLE>A direct assault?

677
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,580
<30-25,HUNT>这是我们最好的机会  她最好的机会
<30-25,HUNT>This is our best shot, her best shot.

678
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,250
<30-25,HUNT>但我们需要一个战略优势
<30-25,HUNT>But we need a tactical advantage.

679
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,620
<30-25,HUNT>我一个人做不到
<30-25,HUNT>I can't do this alone.

680
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,230
<30-26,CASTLE>告诉我你需要什么
<30-26,CASTLE>Tell me what you need.

681
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,530
<30-26,CASTLE>她被关押的地方
<30-26,CASTLE>Where she's being held,

682
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,660
<30-27,HUNT>有一根为整个房子供能的管道
<30-27,HUNT>there's a conduit supplying it

683
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,480
<30-27,HUNT>贯穿在污水管道系统
<30-27,HUNT>that runs through the old sewer system.

684
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,520
<30-27,HUNT>你切断电缆  你就断了他们的电源
<30-27,HUNT>You cut those cables, you cut their power.

685
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,080
<30-27,HUNT>电灯  警报  摄像头
<30-27,HUNT>Lights, alarm, security video--

686
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,600
<30-27,HUNT>那根管道是关键
<30-27,HUNT>That conduit's the key.

687
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,430
<30-27,HUNT>你觉得呢  孩子
<30-27,HUNT>What do you say, kid?

692
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,760
<31-3,HUNT>你应该看到一个分线箱
<31-3,HUNT>You should see a junction box

693
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,020
<31-3,HUNT>分出来六根管道
<31-3,HUNT>with six conduits coming from it.

694
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,750
<31-4,CASTLE>我看到了

<31-5,HUNT>你要找的是从下往上数第三根
<31-5,HUNT>The one you want is the third one from the bottom.

<31-7,HUNT>Wrap the charge around it like I showed you

698
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,920
<31-7,HUNT>装上引爆器
<31-7,HUNT>and then attach the detonator.

699
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,070
<31-8,CASTLE>设定了三十秒
<31-8,CASTLE>All right. I'm setting the detonator for 30 seconds...

<32-11,VOLKOV>不关你的事情也要来插一脚
<32-11,VOLKOV>Getting involved where you don't belong.

720
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,300
<32-11,VOLKOV>他真以为
<32-11,VOLKOV>Did he really think

721

727
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,960
<32-15,VOLKOV>我有了双倍的筹码
<32-15,VOLKOV>When a man doubles his wealth,

728
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,690
<32-15,VOLKOV>为什么要再放弃一半呢

<33-1,HUNT>Once the charge goes off,

753
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,340
<33-1,HUNT>会引起片刻的骚动

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,820
<33-1,HUNT>用这个救她出来
<33-1,HUNT>Use this to get her out.

<35-1,HUNT>他的手下会到前厅去
<35-1,HUNT>His men will move to the front

760
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,960
<35-1,HUNT>跟我交火

<36-1,HUNT>你们从后门走
<36-1,HUNT>You move to the back,

762
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,110
<36-1,HUNT>穿过这些门
<36-1,HUNT>through these doors

763
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,880
<36-1,HUNT>一路穿过走廊

764
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,090
<36-2,CASTLE>那他的手下呢
<36-2,CASTLE>And what about his men?

765
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,100
<36-2,CASTLE>如果他们阻止我们怎么办
<36-2,CASTLE>What if they try to stop us?

766
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,400
<36-3,HUNT>摆平他们啊
<36-3,HUNT>Don't let them.

767
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,650
<36-3,HUNT>一直跑到后门
<36-3,HUNT>Just keep moving until you hit the back door

768
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,370
<37-1,HUNT>因为我会从前门进去
<37-1,HUNT>'cause I'll be coming in the front.

00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,770
<37-1,HUNT>一直跑  不要停
<37-1,HUNT>Don't stop running, ever...

770
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,090
<37-1,HUNT>直到跑到美国大使馆
<37-1,HUNT>not until you reach the U.S. Embassy.

771
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,780
<37-1,HUNT>你到了大使馆以后
<37-1,HUNT>And once you reach the embassy,

772
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,930
<38-1,HUNT>找大使馆副馆长吉姆·阿达科特
<38-1,HUNT>ask for deputy chief of missions Jim Aldacott.

773
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,070
<38-1,HUNT>他会提供给你们官方掩护身份
<38-1,HUNT>And he'll provide you both with an official cover story.

774
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,440
<38-1,HUNT>事情归到国际刑警和法国警方身上
<38-1,HUNT>One that credits Interpol and the French police

775
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,950
<38-1,HUNT>不会牵扯到我
<38-1,HUNT>and doesn't include me.

776
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,380
<38-2,CASTLE>那你之后会怎么样
<38-2,CASTLE>What happens to you after?

777
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,290
<38-3,HUNT>假设...  我们都活着
<38-3,HUNT>Assuming... we're both not killed,

778
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,680
<38-3,HUNT>我会消失
<38-3,HUNT>I-I disappear.

<38-4,CASTLE>不要  我们才
<38-4,CASTLE>No, but we just--

780

<38-5,HUNT>这是工作  这是我的生活
<38-5,HUNT>That's the job. That's my life.

781
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,160
<38-4,CASTLE>没错  但是  我们才见面
<38-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but, uh... we just met.

786
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,300
<38-7,HUNT>或许改天我们能叙个旧
<38-7,HUNT>Maybe we can do that sometime,

787
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,670
<38-7,HUNT>改天吧
<38-7,HUNT>You know, someday.

<38-8,CASTLE>我怎么才能知道你有没有脱身
<38-8,CASTLE>How will I know if you made it?

789
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,100
<38-9,HUNT>你没法知道  至少官方渠道不行
<38-9,HUNT>Oh, you won't. Not officially at least.
