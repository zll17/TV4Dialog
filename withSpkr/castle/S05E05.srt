<2-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>Who'd you think it was?

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,360
<2-3,CASTLE>不知道  我听到有动静
<2-3,CASTLE>I don't know. I heard rustling.

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,340
<2-4,ALEXIS>你要用这个对抗歹徒吗
<2-4,ALEXIS>And you were gonna fight them off with that?

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,890
<2-5,CASTLE>这个可以非常...
<2-5,CASTLE>This could be very...

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,240
<2-5,CASTLE>你回家做什么
<2-5,CASTLE>What are you doing here?

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,450
<2-5,CASTLE>我以为你下周末才回来
<2-5,CASTLE>I thought you weren't coming till next weekend.

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,590
<2-6,ALEXIS>我得回来洗衣服  干净的穿完了
<2-6,ALEXIS>I had to do laundry. I ran out of clothes.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,830
<2-7,CASTLE>这么快吗  才两个星期
<2-7,CASTLE>Already? It's only been two weeks.

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,250
<2-7,CASTLE>不是说我不高兴见到你
<2-7,CASTLE>Not that I'm not thrilled to see you,

23
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,360
<2-7,CASTLE>可学校不是也有洗衣机吗
<2-7,CASTLE>But don't they have washing machines on campus?

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,070
<2-8,ALEXIS>但是不好
<2-8,ALEXIS>They're not as nice.

25
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,230
<2-9,CASTLE>你说不好  是指要钱吧
<2-9,CASTLE>And by "Nice," you mean "Free."

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,770
<2-10,ALEXIS>-差不多  -就知道
<2-10,ALEXIS>- Pretty much. - Right.

27
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,100
<2-12,ALEXIS>对了  要买橙汁了
<2-12,ALEXIS>Uh, you're going to need more orange juice, by the way.

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,230
<2-13,CASTLE>谢谢提醒
<2-13,CASTLE>Thank you.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,450
<2-14,ALEXIS>还有  冰淇淋也被我吃完了
<2-14,ALEXIS>Oh, and, um, I finished the ice cream... too.

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,550
<2-15,CASTLE>你回来多久了
<2-15,CASTLE>And... how long have you been here?

31
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,440
<2-16,ALEXIS>十分钟
<2-16,ALEXIS>Ten minutes.

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,310
<2-17,CASTLE>反正你都回来了
<2-17,CASTLE>Well, as long as you are here,

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,610
<2-17,CASTLE>来个"吉它英雄"对抗赛怎么样
<2-17,CASTLE>how about a guitar hero tournament?

34
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,730
<2-17,CASTLE>我整个周末都在写作  需要休息下
<2-17,CASTLE>I have been writing all weekend. I could use a break.

35
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,790
<2-18,ALEXIS>事实上  我得走了
<2-18,ALEXIS>Actually, I gotta go.

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,470
<2-18,ALEXIS>我要和朋友一起学习
<2-18,ALEXIS>I'm meeting some friends for a study session

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,270
<2-18,ALEXIS>已经迟到了
<2-18,ALEXIS>and I'm already late.

38
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,440
<2-19,CASTLE>你不是要洗衣服吗
<2-19,CASTLE>Uh, well, what about your laundry?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,510
<2-20,ALEXIS>没事  晚点再洗
<2-20,ALEXIS>It's okay. I mean, I'll get it later.

40
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,320
<2-20,ALEXIS>-拜  爸  -拜
<2-20,ALEXIS>- Bye, dad. - Bye.

41
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,170
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>至少她有回家啊  对吧
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>I mean, she came home at least, right?

42
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,700
<3-2,CASTLE>可我希望回来不只为了洗衣服和蹭东西吃嘛
<3-2,CASTLE>Yeah, I just wish it was for more than laundry and supplies.

43
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,630
<3-3,BECKETT>写作有进展吗
<3-3,BECKETT>Did you get some writing done?

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,980
<3-4,CASTLE>母亲大人不在  如有神助
<3-4,CASTLE>With mother gone, are you kidding?

45
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,010
<3-4,CASTLE>写了两章  不过得重写犯罪现场
<3-4,CASTLE>Two chapters, but I gotta rewrite the crime scene.

46
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:48,980
<3-4,CASTLE>现在写得太闷了
<3-4,CASTLE>Right now it's boring.

47
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,460
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>也许这个能启发你  卡塞尔
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Maybe this will inspire you, Castle.

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,900
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>相当让人毛骨悚然
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Pretty damn freaky.

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,970
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>被害人叫泰莎·霍顿  29岁
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Name's Tessa Horton, 29.

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,590
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>室友周末离开了  回到家后
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Roommate came home from a weekend away,

51
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,030
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>发现她在上面
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>found her up there.

52
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,550
<3-6,CASTLE>我的天
<3-6,CASTLE>Ooh, jeez.

53
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,010
<3-6,CASTLE>谁会把尸体挂在天花板上
<3-6,CASTLE>Who puts a body on a ceiling?

54
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,620
<3-7,LANIE PARISH>我也不懂  不过我可能几周都睡不着了
<3-7,LANIE PARISH>Beats me, but I probably won't sleep for weeks.

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,040
<3-8,ESPOSITO>感觉像是你书里才会有的情节  对吗
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Looks like something out of one of your books, right?

56
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,800
<3-9,BECKETT>死因呢
<3-9,BECKETT>Cause of death?

57
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,880
<3-10,LANIE>勒痕与瘀点表示应该是被勒死的
<3-10,LANIE>Ligature marks and petechia suggest strangulation.

58
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,350
<3-11,BECKETT>前额的伤口呢
<3-11,BECKETT>What about this wound on her forehead?

59
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,280
<3-11,BECKETT>不是致命的
<3-11,BECKETT>Well, it's nonlethal.

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,100
<3-12,ESPOSITO>从细节来看  应该是用剃刀割的
<3-12,ESPOSITO>Given the detail, it looks like it was carved by some kind of razor.

61
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,720
<3-13,CASTLE>好像是什么符号
<3-13,CASTLE>It's a symbol of some kind.

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,620
<3-14,BECKETT>你认识吗
<3-14,BECKETT>Do you recognize it?

63
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,870
<3-15,CASTLE>不  但凶手大费周章
<3-15,CASTLE>No, but the killer went through a lot of trouble.

64
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,640
<3-15,CASTLE>肯定有什么意义
<3-15,CASTLE>It must mean something.

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,180
<3-16,BECKETT>要挂起尸体不容易
<3-16,BECKETT>It's not easy hanging a body,

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,280
<3-16,BECKETT>她至少重100磅
<3-16,BECKETT>and she's at least 100 pounds.

67
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,910
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>我跟鉴证组通了气
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>I checked in with C.S.U.

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,280
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>他们在走廊里发现了指纹
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>they found prints in the hallway,

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,690
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>但是公寓里却一尘不染
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>but the apartment is spotless.

70
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,260
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>看来被清洁过了
<3-17,KEVIN RYAN>Looks like it's been wiped down.

71
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,810
<3-18,ESPOSITO>这家伙在行凶后清洁过了
<3-18,ESPOSITO>This guy cleaned up after himself.

72
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,660
<3-19,CASTLE>他不介意慢慢来
<3-19,CASTLE>He didn't mind taking his time.

73
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,780
<3-20,BECKETT>所以凶手知道室友会离开市区
<3-20,BECKETT>So the killer knew that the roommate was gonna be out of town.

74
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,410
<3-20,BECKETT>这栋楼的安保情况怎么样
<3-20,BECKETT>What's the security like in this place?

75
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,610
<3-21,RYAN>门铃在前门
<3-21,RYAN>Buzzer on the front door,

76
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,070
<3-21,RYAN>没有门卫和摄像头
<3-21,RYAN>no doorman or security cameras.

77
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,730
<3-21,RYAN>但没有强行闯入的迹象
<3-21,RYAN>But there's no sign of a forced entry,

78
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,220
<3-21,RYAN>没有打斗的痕迹
<3-21,RYAN>no sign of a struggle.

79
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,360
<3-22,BECKETT>她认识凶手
<3-22,BECKETT>She knew him.

80
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,580
<3-23,BECKETT>好的  排查下邻近的公寓
<3-23,BECKETT>All right, canvass neighboring apartments

81
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,450
<3-23,BECKETT>看看有没有人看到或听到什么
<3-23,BECKETT>for anyone that saw or heard anything,

82
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,580
<3-23,BECKETT>我要知道这个符号是什么意思
<3-23,BECKETT>And I want to know what this symbol means.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,430
<3-24,BECKETT>如果泰莎认识凶手
<3-24,BECKETT>You know, if Tessa knew our killer,

84
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,010
<3-24,BECKETT>她的室友可能会提供些情况
<3-24,BECKETT>it's possible that her roommate could shed some light on all of this.

85
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,170
<4-1,ELLE>每次我闭上眼睛  都能见到她被挂在上面
<4-1,ELLE>Every time I close my eyes, I see her hanging there.

86
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,970
<4-2,BECKETT>她做什么工作的
<4-2,BECKETT>What did she do for a living?

87
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,000
<4-3,ELLE>她是商业房产的保险经纪人
<4-3,ELLE>She was an insurance broker for commercial real estate.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,530
<4-3,ELLE>科茨曼保险公司
<4-3,ELLE>Kurtzman insurance.

89
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,760
<4-4,CASTLE>她有很多朋友吗
<4-4,CASTLE>Did she have a lot of friends?

90
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,320
<4-5,ELLE>她很内向
<4-5,ELLE>She was shy...

91
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,960
<4-5,ELLE>是个工作狂
<4-5,ELLE>and a workaholic.

92
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,520
<4-5,ELLE>我差不多要硬拽才能让她出门
<4-5,ELLE>I practically had to drag her out of the house.

93
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,020
<4-6,BECKETT>没有男朋友吗
<4-6,BECKETT>So no boyfriend then?

94
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,340
<4-7,ELLE>事实上  她开始谈恋爱了
<4-7,ELLE>Actually, she did start seeing someone,

95
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,900
<4-7,ELLE>大概六周前
<4-7,ELLE>maybe six weeks ago.

96
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,930
<4-8,CASTLE>你知道是谁吗
<4-8,CASTLE>Do you know who?

97
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,740
<4-9,ELLE>重点就是她只字未提  她...
<4-9,ELLE>That's the thing, she never did say. She...

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,180
<4-9,ELLE>她表现得好像是什么大秘密
<4-9,ELLE>She acted like it was some big secret,

99
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,570
<4-9,ELLE>就好像他结婚了还是怎么的
<4-9,ELLE>like maybe he was married or something.

100
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,880
<4-9,ELLE>但他送珠宝给她
<4-9,ELLE>But he bought her jewelry

101
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,390
<4-9,ELLE>带她去高级餐厅吃饭
<4-9,ELLE>and took her to these fancy dinners.

102
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,010
<4-9,ELLE>她说从没有人对她这样好过
<4-9,ELLE>She said no one's ever treated her that way before.

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,450
<4-10,BECKETT>她还告诉你什么关于他的事了吗
<4-10,BECKETT>Did she tell you anything else about him,

104
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,990
<4-10,BECKETT>他长什么样子  在哪里认识的
<4-10,BECKETT>The way he looked, where they met?

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,110
<4-10,BECKETT>没有
<4-10,BECKETT>No.

106
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,370
<4-11,ELLE>她只说他是每个女生的梦中情人
<4-11,ELLE>All she said was he was every woman's fairy tale--

107
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,560
<4-11,ELLE>富有  英俊  大方
<4-11,ELLE>Rich, handsome, and generous.

108
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,830
<4-11,ELLE>好狠的梦中情人
<4-11,ELLE>Well, some fairy tale.

109
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,800
<5-1,CASTLE>我告诉你们  这事可不止和已婚男人
<5-1,CASTLE>I'll tell you this much, there's a lot more to this story

110
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,620
<5-1,CASTLE>发生婚外情那么简单
<5-1,CASTLE>than an affair with a married man.

111
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,260
<5-2,BECKETT>也许  但没找到他之前我们什么也不知道
<5-2,BECKETT>Maybe, but we won't know what until we find him.

112
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,670
<5-2,BECKETT>查她的通话记录  看看能不能找到这个人
<5-2,BECKETT>Get on her phone records. See if you can I.D. this guy.

113
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,290
<5-3,RYAN>好  我还会叫他们查电邮
<5-3,RYAN>Yeah. I'll have 'em pull her e-mails, too.

114
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,480
<5-4,CASTLE>符号有什么进展吗
<5-4,CASTLE>Anything on that symbol yet?

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,590
<5-5,RYAN>问过联邦调查局了
<5-5,RYAN>Put a call into the feds.

116
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,460
<5-5,RYAN>他们现在正在查数据库
<5-5,RYAN>They're running it through their database right now.

117
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,900
<5-6,BECKETT>怎么了
<5-6,BECKETT>What?

118
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,600
<5-7,CASTLE>他放置尸体的方式  所花的时间
<5-7,CASTLE>The way he left the body, the time it took--

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
<5-7,CASTLE>不管是谁做的
<5-7,CASTLE>whoever did this,

120
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,700
<5-7,CASTLE>他都很享受
<5-7,CASTLE>He liked it.

121
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,230
<6-1,LANIE>如果她有男友  那晚并未发生什么事
<6-1,LANIE>If she had a boyfriend, nothing happened that night.

<6-1,LANIE>没有性暴力或性行为的痕迹
<6-1,LANIE>There are no signs of sexual assault or activity.

123
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,650
<6-1,LANIE>她是被勒死的
<6-1,LANIE>Death was by strangulation.

124
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,580
<6-1,LANIE>作案工具是绳子或者围巾
<6-1,LANIE>Looks like a rope or a scarf.

125
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,980
<6-2,BECKETT>你能推测一下更准确的死亡时间吗
<6-2,BECKETT>Were you able to narrow down a time?

126
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,040
<6-3,LANIE>周六凌晨2点到3点之间
<6-3,LANIE>Somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M. Saturday morning.

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,260
<6-3,LANIE>淤青和血迹表明凶手
<6-3,LANIE>Lividity and pooling indicate the body was hung

128
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,130
<6-3,LANIE>是在她死后将她挂上天花板的
<6-3,LANIE>from the ceiling postmortem.

129
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,920
<6-4,BECKETT>为什么要在杀死她之后把尸体吊起来
<6-4,BECKETT>Why would he hang her body after he killed her?

130
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,840
<6-5,CASTLE>某种仪式吗
<6-5,CASTLE>A ritual?

131
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,330
<6-6,LANIE>诡异的不止这些
<6-6,LANIE>That's not all that's weird.

132
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,720
<6-6,LANIE>勒杀是一种很暴力的行为
<6-6,LANIE>Strangulation is a violent act,

133
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
<6-6,LANIE>但她没有反抗的痕迹
<6-6,LANIE>But there were no signs that she fought back--

134
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,830
<6-6,LANIE>她的指甲中没有皮肤残留  没有瘀伤
<6-6,LANIE>No skin under the fingernails, no bruising--

135
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,470
<6-6,LANIE>所以我又做了些检查
<6-6,LANIE>So I did some checking.

136
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,850
<6-6,LANIE>她被下药了
<6-6,LANIE>She was drugged.

137
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,980
<6-6,LANIE>肺部组织显示她曾被氯仿麻醉过
<6-6,LANIE>Lung tissue suggests exposure to chloroform.

138
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,420
<6-6,LANIE>而且  凶手十分小心
<6-6,LANIE>Also... your killer was careful.

139
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,290
<6-6,LANIE>他作案时带着手套
<6-6,LANIE>He was wearing gloves.

140
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,180
<6-7,CASTLE>你怎么知道的
<6-7,CASTLE>How can you tell?

141
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,200
<6-8,LANIE>她的身体上残留有滑石粉
<6-8,LANIE>Traces of talcum powder on the body--

142
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,530
<6-8,LANIE>是那种手术手套上常用的滑石粉
<6-8,LANIE>The same talc used in surgical gloves

143
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,680
<6-8,LANIE>或是你们在犯罪现场取证用的手套
<6-8,LANIE>Or the evidence gloves that you use at the crime scenes.

144
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,250
<6-8,LANIE>不管凶手是谁
<6-8,LANIE>Whoever this person is,

145
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,400
<6-8,LANIE>都是一个十分专业的人
<6-8,LANIE>they knew exactly what they were doing.

146
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,170
<6-9,CASTLE>他以前就干过这种事
<6-9,CASTLE>He's done this before.

147
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,480
<7-1,BECKETT>仪式型谋杀
<7-1,BECKETT>Ritualistic killing,

148
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,440
<7-1,BECKETT>能从中取乐
<7-1,BECKETT>takes pleasure in it,

149
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,480
<7-1,BECKETT>十分小心地处理犯罪现场
<7-1,BECKETT>significant care exhibited at the crime scene...

150
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,540
<7-2,CASTLE>都是连环杀手的显著特征
<7-2,CASTLE>All the hallmarks of a serial killer.

151
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,530
<7-3,BECKETT>是啊  但我从未见过这种作案模式
<7-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but I've never seen this M.O.

152
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,600
<7-4,RYAN>嘿  坏消息
<7-4,RYAN>Hey, bad news.

153
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,310
<7-4,RYAN>联调局查了那个符号  没有结果
<7-4,RYAN>The feds struck out on the symbol.

154
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,320
<7-4,RYAN>它和古代的某种炼金术标志有些相似性
<7-4,RYAN>It bears some similarities to some ancient alchemy signs,

155
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,630
<7-4,RYAN>但他们之前从未见过这样的
<7-4,RYAN>but they've never seen this one before.

156
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,870
<7-5,BECKETT>查电话记录有发现什么线索吗
<7-5,BECKETT>Any luck on the phone records?

157
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,900
<7-6,RYAN>没有  但她曾经常
<7-6,RYAN>No, but she spent

158
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,350
<7-6,RYAN>和一个未知号码通话
<7-6,RYAN>a lot of time on the phone to a blocked number.

159
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,340
<7-6,RYAN>电话公司追查到
<7-6,RYAN>Phone company traced it

160
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,970
<7-6,RYAN>那是个未注册的一次性电话  用的是偷来的卡
<7-6,RYAN>to an unlisted burner phone with a stolen sim.

161
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,270
<7-7,CASTLE>-说明他早有预谋  -是的
<7-7,CASTLE>- So he planned ahead. - Yeah.

162
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,510
<7-8,BECKETT>那她的邮件呢
<7-8,BECKETT>What about her e-mails?

163
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,130
<7-9,RYAN>没有她那神秘男友的来信
<7-9,RYAN>Nothing from her mystery lover,

164
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,640
<7-9,RYAN>所以我让技术人员检查了一下她的硬盘
<7-9,RYAN>So I had them take a look at her hard drive.

165
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,380
<7-9,RYAN>发现有部分被彻底格式化了
<7-9,RYAN>Turns out portions of it have been surgically wiped,

166
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,010
<7-9,RYAN>像是某人要掩盖踪迹
<7-9,RYAN>like someone covering their tracks.

167
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,410
<7-10,CASTLE>所以我们现在是一无所获了
<7-10,CASTLE>So we're back to square one.

168
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,690
<7-11,BECKETT>那可不一定
<7-11,BECKETT>Not necessarily.

169
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,050
<7-11,BECKETT>泰莎的室友说他曾给她一些珠宝
<7-11,BECKETT>Uh, Tessa's roommate said that he gave her some jewelry.

170
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,160
<7-11,BECKETT>或许他的指纹会残留在某件珠宝上
<7-11,BECKETT>Maybe he left a fingerprint on one of those pieces.

171
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
<7-12,RYAN>我现在就去她家  看看能发现什么
<7-12,RYAN>I'll head to her place, see what I can find out.

172
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,750
<7-13,CASTLE>珠宝  我肯定想不到这上面去的
<7-13,CASTLE>Jewelry. I never would've thought of that.

173
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,570
<7-14,BECKETT>恐怕等我生日快到的时候  得提醒你一下
<7-14,BECKETT>I guess I'll have to remind you when my birthday's coming up.

174
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,010
<7-15,CASTLE>怎么  贝克特警长
<7-15,CASTLE>Why, detective Beckett,

175
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,490
<7-15,CASTLE>你刚刚是故意给我留下了暗示吗
<7-15,CASTLE>was that a hint you just dropped?

176
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,300
<7-16,BECKETT>是的  卡塞尔先生  我觉得确实如此
<7-16,BECKETT>Why, Mr. Castle, I do believe it was.

177
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,250
<7-17,CASTLE>真可耻
<7-17,CASTLE>Shameless.

178
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,210
<7-18,ESPOSITO>贝克特  你有空吗
<7-18,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett, you got a second?

179
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,180
<7-18,ESPOSITO>我想跟你说句话
<7-18,ESPOSITO>I need a word.

180
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,940
<7-19,BECKETT>好吧  怎么
<7-19,BECKETT>Okay. So...

181
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,580
<7-19,BECKETT>什么事
<7-19,BECKETT>What's up?

182
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,580
<7-20,ESPOSITO>我拿到了鉴证组的鉴证结果
<7-20,ESPOSITO>We got the C.S.U. Report back.

183
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,720
<7-22,ESPOSITO>泰莎的公寓内部被清理得很干净
<7-22,ESPOSITO>The inside of Tessa's apartment was wiped clean.

184
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,170
<7-23,BECKETT>是啊  意料之中的事
<7-23,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we expected that.

185
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,700
<7-23,BECKETT>但我们没料想到这个
<7-23,BECKETT>Yeah, but we didn't expect this.

186
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,090
<7-24,ESPOSITO>鉴证组从外面的门把手和门框上
<7-24,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. were able to pull prints off the outside doorknob

187
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,390
<7-24,ESPOSITO>采集到一些指纹
<7-24,ESPOSITO>and from around the door frame.

188
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,760
<7-24,ESPOSITO>发现其中一组与泰莎和她室友的都不符
<7-24,ESPOSITO>And they found a set that didn't match Tessa's or her roommate's.

189
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,300
<7-24,ESPOSITO>当他们搜索的时候
<7-24,ESPOSITO>When they ran it,

190
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,200
<7-24,ESPOSITO>发现和系统中的另外一个人相匹配
<7-24,ESPOSITO>they found a match to someone else in the system.

191
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,270
<7-25,BECKETT>好吧  是谁
<7-25,BECKETT>Okay. Who?

192
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,640
<7-26,ESPOSITO>理查德·卡塞尔
<7-26,ESPOSITO>Richard castle.

193
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,600
<7-26,ESPOSITO>犯罪现场外采集的指纹样本
<7-26,ESPOSITO>与理查德·卡塞尔相匹配

194
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,760
<7-27,BECKETT>这..  不可能吧
<7-27,BECKETT>Y--uh, that can't be right.

195
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,150
<7-27,BECKETT>可能...  只是个意外吧
<7-27,BECKETT>You know what? It w--it was probably just an accident.

196
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,590
<7-27,BECKETT>他可能进门的时候不小心摸到了
<7-27,BECKETT>He probably touched them on his way in

197
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,960
<7-27,BECKETT>当时还没有戴上手套
<7-27,BECKETT>before putting his gloves on.

198
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,900
<7-28,ESPOSITO>是啊  那样倒也说得通
<7-28,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I mean, that would explain it,

199
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,000
<7-28,ESPOSITO>只不过鉴证组是在你们进去前先采样的
<7-28,ESPOSITO>Except that C.S.U. Collected them before either of you arrived.

209
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,510
<8-1,CASTLE>你确定吗
<8-1,CASTLE>Are you sure about this?

210
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,710
<8-2,ESPOSITO>你自己看吧  老兄
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Look for yourself, bro.

211
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,340
<8-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  好好想想  有没有可能
<8-3,BECKETT>Castle, think. Is it possible

212
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,360
<8-3,BECKETT>是你进门的时候摸过门把手或者门框
<8-3,BECKETT>that you touched the doorknob or the frame on your way in?

213
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,930
<8-4,CASTLE>我进去的时候门是开着的  但我想我肯定摸过
<8-4,CASTLE>It was open when I came in, but I guess I must have.

214
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,370
<8-5,ESPOSITO>你以前去过那栋房子里吗
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Had you been in that building before?

215
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,640
<8-6,CASTLE>在今天之前都没去过
<8-6,CASTLE>Not before today.

216
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,010
<8-7,ESPOSITO>那个被害人呢
<8-7,ESPOSITO>What about the victim?

217
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,630
<8-7,ESPOSITO>你确定你不认识她吗
<8-7,ESPOSITO>Are you sure you didn't know her?

218
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,520
<8-8,BECKETT>哈维
<8-8,BECKETT>Javi.

219
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,110
<8-8,BECKETT>怎么
<8-8,BECKETT>What?

220
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,000
<8-9,ESPOSITO>你知道我必须得问
<8-9,ESPOSITO>You know I have to ask.

221
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,220
<8-10,BECKETT>不  事情很简单
<8-10,BECKETT>No, it's simple, okay?

222
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,700
<8-10,BECKETT>他进去的时候摸到了门
<8-10,BECKETT>He touched the door when he walked in.

223
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,180
<8-10,BECKETT>鉴证组搞错了采样时间
<8-10,BECKETT>C.S.U. Got the time frame wrong.

224
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,600
<8-10,BECKETT>那是唯一的解释
<8-10,BECKETT>That's the only explanation.

225
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
<8-11,CASTLE>除非我有个邪恶的双胞胎兄弟
<8-11,CASTLE>Unless I've got an evil twin.

226
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,520
<8-12,ESPOSITO>双胞胎的指纹是不一样的
<8-12,ESPOSITO>Twins don't have the same fingerprints.

227
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,580
<8-12,ESPOSITO>那是常见的错误想法  指纹就是你的
<8-12,ESPOSITO>It's a common misconception. This was you.

228
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,230
<8-13,CASTLE>是啊  我知道  我开玩笑罢了
<8-13,CASTLE>Yeah, I know. I was joking.

229
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,390
<8-14,ESPOSITO>犯罪现场被污染可不是玩笑
<8-14,ESPOSITO>A contaminated crime scene is not a joke.

230
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,200
<8-14,ESPOSITO>我去鉴证组那边说清楚一下
<8-14,ESPOSITO>I'll square this away with C.S.U.

231
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,850
<8-14,ESPOSITO>你下次管好你的手  好吗
<8-14,ESPOSITO>You watch your hands next time, okay?

232
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,900
<8-15,CASTLE>抱歉
<8-15,CASTLE>Sorry.

233
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,640
<8-16,BECKETT>下次小心点
<8-16,BECKETT>Just be careful.

234
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,840
<8-17,CASTLE>好的  好的
<8-17,CASTLE>Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

236
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,550
<8-18,BECKETT>我翻遍了泰莎的衣物
<8-18,BECKETT>So I've been through all of Tessa's belongings.

237
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,410
<8-19,RYAN>没有名贵珠宝
<8-19,RYAN>No sign of any high-end jewelry,

238
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,200
<8-19,RYAN>不过从她的首饰盒中有几个空格推断
<8-19,RYAN>but from the empty spaces in her jewel box,

239
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,740
<8-19,RYAN>可能有几件首饰丢失
<8-19,RYAN>there might be some pieces missing.

240
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,440
<8-20,BECKETT>他把送她的东西拿走了
<8-20,BECKETT>He took back the ones he gave her.

241
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
<8-20,BECKETT>好像他知道我们在找什么
<8-20,BECKETT>It's like he knew what we were looking for.

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,480
<8-21,CASTLE>这家伙清楚如何不露马脚
<8-21,CASTLE>This guy really knows how to cover his tracks.

243
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,680
<8-22,RYAN>不  智者千虑  必有一失
<8-22,RYAN>Oh, no, not all of them.

244
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,260
<8-22,RYAN>我们彻查全楼后  发现有个邻居
<8-22,RYAN>Canvass of the building turned up a neighbor

245
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,970
<8-22,RYAN>他说看到有人在周五晚7:45
<8-22,RYAN>who claims he saw someone heading to her apartment

246
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,790
<8-22,RYAN>进了她的公寓
<8-22,RYAN>at 7:45 on Friday night.

247
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,040
<8-23,BECKETT>这位邻居看清他的样子了吗
<8-23,BECKETT>Did the neighbor get a good look at him?

248
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,140
<8-24,RYAN>他透过他家前门的猫眼
<8-24,RYAN>Well, he got a clear shot

249
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,660
<8-24,RYAN>看得一清二楚
<8-24,RYAN>right through his front door peephole.

250
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,130
<8-24,RYAN>我马上叫素描师来画像
<8-24,RYAN>I'm bringing in a sketch artist right now.

251
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,030
<8-25,BECKETT>好  一画好就送过来
<8-25,BECKETT>All right. Get it over as soon as it's done.

252
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,460
<8-25,BECKETT>她室友说不定能认出来
<8-25,BECKETT>The roommate might be able to I.D. him.

253
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:39,970
<8-26,RYAN>好的
<8-26,RYAN>You got it.

254
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,250
<8-27,OFFICER>警探
<8-27,OFFICER>Detective.

255
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,860
<9-1,ESPOSITO>她室友认出他是泰莎的老板
<9-1,ESPOSITO>The roommate identified him as Tessa's boss,

256
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,630
<9-1,ESPOSITO>罗伊德·科茨曼  科茨曼保险经纪行的总裁
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Lloyd Kurtzman, C.E.O. of Kurtzman Insurance Brokerage.

257
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,440
<9-2,BECKETT>有前科吗
<9-2,BECKETT>Any priors?

258
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,130
<9-3,ESPOSITO>没犯什么大罪
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Nothing major.

259
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,690
<9-3,ESPOSITO>被投诉过几次性骚扰
<9-3,ESPOSITO>He's got a couple of harassment suits,

260
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,600
<9-3,ESPOSITO>不过他确实曾是个少年犯
<9-3,ESPOSITO>but he does have a sealed juvie file.

261
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,160
<9-4,CASTLE>少年犯
<9-4,CASTLE>A juvie file?

262
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,320
<9-5,BECKETT>联系马克维法官
<9-5,BECKETT>Call Judge Markaway.

263
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,960
<9-5,BECKETT>就算科茨曼小时候虐狗
<9-5,BECKETT>If Kurtzman was torturing puppies as a kid,

264
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,980
<9-5,BECKETT>我也要知道
<9-5,BECKETT>I want to know.

265
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,090
<9-6,BECKETT>英俊多金  符合泰莎的神秘男友形象
<9-6,BECKETT>Good-looking and rich, huh? Just like Tessa's mystery man.

266
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,910
<9-7,CASTLE>就像泰莎的神秘男友  他有家室了
<9-7,CASTLE>And like Tessa's mystery man, he's married.

267
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,470
<10-1,LLOYD KURTZMAN>她那么光彩夺目
<10-1,LLOYD KURTZMAN>She was such a glowing presence.

268
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,670
<10-1,LLOYD KURTZMAN>让你无法抗拒
<10-1,LLOYD KURTZMAN>You couldn't help but notice her.

269
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,270
<10-1,LLOYD KURTZMAN>有人想杀她  真是难以想象
<10-1,LLOYD KURTZMAN>You know, it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to kill her.

270
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,770
<10-2,CASTLE>确实如此
<10-2,CASTLE>I'm sure it is.

271
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,490
<10-3,BECKETT>你们俩亲近吗
<10-3,BECKETT>Were the two of you close?

272
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,170
<10-4,KURTZMAN>和我跟其他雇员一样亲近
<10-4,KURTZMAN>As close as I am to any of my employees.

273
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,130
<10-5,BECKETT>你上次见她是什么时候
<10-5,BECKETT>And when was the last time that you saw her?

274
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,020
<10-5,BECKETT>周五上午
<10-5,BECKETT>Friday morning

275
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,550
<10-6,KURTZMAN>在我们的员工会议上
<10-6,KURTZMAN>at our staff meeting.

276
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,380
<10-7,BECKETT>周五上午  你确定吗
<10-7,BECKETT>Friday morning? Are you sure?

277
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,360
<10-8,KURTZMAN>确定
<10-8,KURTZMAN>Yes.

278
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,400
<10-9,CASTLE>不是周五晚吗
<10-9,CASTLE>Not friday evening?

279
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,820
<10-10,KURTZMAN>不是
<10-10,KURTZMAN>No, uh--

280
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,180
<10-11,BECKETT>那你没在晚上7:45去她家吗
<10-11,BECKETT>So you didn't go to Tessa's apartment at 7:45?

281
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,770
<10-12,KURTZMAN>她家  没  没
<10-12,KURTZMAN>Her--her apartment? No, no.

282
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,650
<10-13,BECKETT>那就怪了
<10-13,BECKETT>That's funny.

283
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,030
<10-13,BECKETT>有目击者看到你那晚出现在她家
<10-13,BECKETT>We, um, we have a witness that saw you there that night.

284
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,520
<10-13,BECKETT>科茨曼先生  你周五晚在哪里
<10-13,BECKETT>Mr. Kurtzman, where were you Friday night?

285
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,360
<10-14,KURTZMAN>我想立刻见我的律师
<10-14,KURTZMAN>I-I'd like to speak to my lawyer now.

286
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,660
<11-1,BECKETT>他不肯开口
<11-1,BECKETT>He's not talking.

287
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,760
<11-2,CASTLE>我想指望他坦白是希望不大了
<11-2,CASTLE>I guess a confession was too much to hope for.

288
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,800
<11-2,CASTLE>或许能有某种说法来解释前因后果
<11-2,CASTLE>Some story that might explain it all.

289
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,500
<11-3,BECKETT>对  我们派了人手去他家和他办公室
<11-3,BECKETT>Yeah, we've got teams at his home and his office.

290
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,780
<11-3,BECKETT>搜查过后就能见分晓了
<11-3,BECKETT>We'll know more after the search,

291
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,210
<11-3,BECKETT>埃斯波西托和他妻子谈过
<11-3,BECKETT>but Esposito talked to his wife,

292
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,340
<11-3,BECKETT>她说他那晚没回家
<11-3,BECKETT>and she said he didn't come home that night.

293
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,380
<11-3,BECKETT>他工作到很晚
<11-3,BECKETT>He was working late.

294
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,430
<11-4,CASTLE>我想他当时没在工作
<11-4,CASTLE>I'm guessing he wasn't at work.

295
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,510
<11-5,BECKETT>对
<11-5,BECKETT>No.

296
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,650
<11-6,CASTLE>我在想是否还有其他受害人
<11-6,CASTLE>I wonder if there were others

297
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,270
<11-6,CASTLE>还是她是第一个
<11-6,CASTLE>or if she was the first,

298
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,780
<11-6,CASTLE>是否她的"光彩夺目"唤醒了他内心的欲望
<11-6,CASTLE>if her "Glowing presence" awakened something inside him.

299
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,310
<11-6,CASTLE>怎么了
<11-6,CASTLE>What's wrong?

300
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,440
<11-7,BECKETT>我...
<11-7,BECKETT>It's...

301
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,550
<11-7,BECKETT>我只是想起了犯罪现场
<11-7,BECKETT>It's just that crime scene.

302
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,380
<11-8,CASTLE>怎么了
<11-8,CASTLE>What about it?

303
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,670
<11-9,BECKETT>杀死泰莎的凶手心思缜密
<11-9,BECKETT>The person that killed Tessa was meticulous,

304
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,110
<11-9,BECKETT>可我们审问科茨曼时  他诚惶诚恐
<11-9,BECKETT>but when we questioned Kurtzman, he got all flustered.

305
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,950
<11-10,CASTLE>所以呢
<11-10,CASTLE>So?

306
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,470
<11-11,BECKETT>所以如果他能那么心思缜密地去杀她
<11-11,BECKETT>So if he put that much thought into killing her,

307
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,670
<11-11,BECKETT>为什么却没准备好自己的不在场证明
<11-11,BECKETT>then why didn't he have an alibi prepared?

308
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,880
<11-12,CASTLE>说不定他太过缜密
<11-12,CASTLE>Perhaps because he was so meticulous,

309
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,750
<11-12,CASTLE>没想过会被捕
<11-12,CASTLE>he didn't expect to get caught.

310
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,380
<12-2,BECKETT>什么情况
<12-2,BECKETT>Hey. What'd you find?

311
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,610
<12-3,ESPOSITO>还在取证阶段
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Well, they're still processing,

312
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,020
<12-3,ESPOSITO>可目前为止还没发现他家或办公室
<12-3,ESPOSITO>but so far there's nothing at his house or office

313
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,490
<12-3,ESPOSITO>有把他和凶案联系起来的证据
<12-3,ESPOSITO>that connects Kurtzman to the murder.

314
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,610
<12-4,BECKETT>查他的电邮了吗
<12-4,BECKETT>Did you check his e-mails?

315
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,980
<12-5,EPSOSITO>查了  他硬盘上没有被删除的神秘文件
<12-5,EPSOSITO>Yeah. There's no mysterious deletions from his hard drive,

316
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,390
<12-5,EPSOSITO>没异常活动
<12-5,EPSOSITO>no unusual activity,

317
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,610
<12-5,EPSOSITO>电话记录也没有可疑号码
<12-5,EPSOSITO>nothing in his phone records, either.

318
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,760
<12-6,BECKETT>好  这也不足为奇
<12-6,BECKETT>Okay, well, that's not a surprise.

319
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,850
<6-9,CASTLE>如果他不是初犯
<6-9,CASTLE>I mean, if he's done this before,

320
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,100
<8-21,CASTLE>就会知道如何掩盖罪证
<8-21,CASTLE>he knows how to cover his tracks.

321
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,180
<12-6,BECKETT>他的少年犯记录呢
<12-6,BECKETT>What about his juvie record?

322
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,880
<12-7,ESPOSITO>打过几次架  偷过一辆邻居的车
<12-7,ESPOSITO>A couple of fights, stole a neighbor's car.

323
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,450
<12-7,ESPOSITO>没有和这次相关的前科
<12-7,ESPOSITO>Nothing that explains this.

324
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,210
<12-8,BECKETT>所以我们现在只有她邻居的指认吗
<12-8,BECKETT>So then all we have is the neighbor's I.D.?

325
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,710
<12-8,BECKETT>这样可破不了案
<12-8,BECKETT>That's not enough to make a case.

326
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,360
<12-9,RYAN>我可能找到了有用证据
<12-9,RYAN>I think I might have found something that can help,

327
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,420
<12-9,RYAN>科茨曼可能漏掉的东西
<12-9,RYAN>Something Kurtzman may have missed.

328
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,470
<12-10,BECKETT>一只钻石耳环
<12-10,BECKETT>A diamond earring?

329
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,710
<12-11,RYAN>沙发里找到的
<12-11,RYAN>We found it in the couch.

330
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,080
<12-11,RYAN>鉴证组提取不到上面的指纹
<12-11,RYAN>C.S.U. couldn't pull a print off it,

331
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,120
<12-11,RYAN>可你看到这图案了吗
<12-11,RYAN>But you see the design?

332
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,370
<12-11,RYAN>定制的  艾瑞卡·科特尼
<12-11,RYAN>That's custom-- Erica Courtney.

333
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,940
<12-12,ESPOSITO>你怎么知道的
<12-12,ESPOSITO>And you know this how?

334
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,710
<12-13,RYAN>我和珍妮买耳环的时候知道的
<12-13,RYAN>I recognized it from when Jenny and I went ring shopping.

335
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,430
<12-13,RYAN>不管怎样  我联系了展示厅
<12-13,RYAN>Anyway, I called up the showroom.

336
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,840
<12-13,RYAN>他们确认这是他们的产品
<12-13,RYAN>They confirmed it's one of theirs.

337
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
<12-14,BECKETT>他们有销售记录吗
<12-14,BECKETT>And do they have a record of who they sold it to?

338
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,660
<12-15,RYAN>有  我查了姓名和地址
<12-15,RYAN>Yeah, I ran the name and the address.

339
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,510
<12-15,RYAN>都是伪造的
<12-15,RYAN>They're both fake.

340
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,590
<12-16,ESPOSITO>信用卡信息呢
<12-16,ESPOSITO>What about the credit card info?

341
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,910
<12-17,RYAN>买耳环的人用的是支票  一万二
<12-17,RYAN>Well, buyer paid with a cashier's check. 12 grand.

342
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,310
<12-18,BECKETT>所以我们也没法追查到他或者这笔钱了
<12-18,BECKETT>So we have no way of tracing him or the payment.

343
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,720
<12-19,RYAN>对  但是商店用了数码监控
<12-19,RYAN>No, but the store uses digital surveillance,

344
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,910
<12-19,RYAN>他们刚刚把录影带送过来
<12-19,RYAN>And they just sent over the tapes.

345
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,660
<13-1,RYAN>这就是物品出售的时间点
<13-1,RYAN>Here's the time code for our point of sale.

346
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,270
<13-1,RYAN>这就是我们要找的人
<13-1,RYAN>That's our guy.

347
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,400
<13-2,ESPOSITO>看看他的身高
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Look at his height,

348
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,020
<13-2,ESPOSITO>体型  发色
<13-2,ESPOSITO>build, hair color.

349
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,770
<13-2,ESPOSITO>他不是科茨曼
<13-2,ESPOSITO>That's not Kurtzman.

350
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,360
<13-2,ESPOSITO>他是  卡塞尔
<13-2,ESPOSITO>That's... Castle.

351
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,420
<14-1,BECKETT>一定还有其他的解释
<14-1,BECKETT>There's another explanation.

352
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,310
<14-2,ESPOSITO>比如说
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Like what?

353
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,410
<14-3,BECKETT>我不知道  好吗  那是其他人
<14-3,BECKETT>I don't know, okay? It's somebody else.

354
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,740
<14-3,BECKETT>某个看起来像卡塞尔的人
<14-3,BECKETT>Someone that looks like castle.

355
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,170
<14-4,ESPOSITO>我们在案发现场发现了他的指纹
<14-4,ESPOSITO>We found his fingerprints at the crime scene.

356
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,610
<14-4,ESPOSITO>我们在录像上看到他给被害人买珠宝
<14-4,ESPOSITO>We got him on video buying jewelry for our victim.

357
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,770
<14-4,ESPOSITO>这绝不是巧合
<14-4,ESPOSITO>It can't be a coincidence.

358
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,000
<14-5,BECKETT>哈维  你是说卡塞尔是凶手吗
<14-5,BECKETT>Javi, what are you saying, that Castle's a killer?

359
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,130
<14-6,RYAN>不不不  我们谁都没这么说
<14-6,RYAN>Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. None of us are saying that.

360
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,100
<14-6,RYAN>他的意思就是
<14-6,RYAN>All he's saying is that

361
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,260
<14-6,RYAN>如果是其他人  我们会好好查的
<14-6,RYAN>If it were anyone else, we'd look into it.

362
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,870
<14-7,ESPOSITO>我们可以先查他的财务信息
<14-7,ESPOSITO>We can start by looking at his financials,

363
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,180
<14-7,ESPOSITO>看看他在买下下珠宝那段时间
<14-7,ESPOSITO>See if there's any unusual activity

364
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,960
<14-7,ESPOSITO>是否有过不正常的活动
<14-7,ESPOSITO>around the time of the purchase.

365
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,290
<14-8,BECKETT>好吧
<14-8,BECKETT>Fine.

366
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,480
<14-8,BECKETT>但我们必须要悄悄地进行
<14-8,BECKETT>But we do it quietly,

367
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,590
<14-8,BECKETT>不能让他知道
<14-8,BECKETT>and he never finds out about it.

368
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,300
<14-10,ESPOSITO>你到底要干嘛
<14-10,ESPOSITO>What are you doing?

369
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,350
<14-11,RYAN>哈维  有件事必须让你知道
<14-11,RYAN>Uh, Javi, there's something you need to know.

370
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,490
<15-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特和卡塞尔
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Beckett and Castle?

371
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,500
<15-1,ESPOSITO>什么时候开始的
<15-1,ESPOSITO>W--uh--w-when did they start?

372
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,550
<15-2,RYAN>不清楚
<15-2,RYAN>I'm not sure.

373
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,720
<15-2,RYAN>但我知道他们那个周末是在汉普顿一起过的
<15-2,RYAN>But I know they were together that weekend in the Hamptons.

374
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,960
<15-3,ESPOSITO>她为什么不告诉我们
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Why wouldn't she tell us?

375
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,810
<15-4,RYAN>我猜她是担心盖茨会发现
<15-4,RYAN>I guess she was afraid Gates would find out,

376
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,240
<15-4,RYAN>然后用警局的规定把卡塞尔赶走
<15-4,RYAN>use NYPD regs to give Castle the boot.

377
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,570
<15-4,RYAN>我本来打算谁都不告诉
<15-4,RYAN>I was gonna keep it a secret myself,

378
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,120
<15-4,RYAN>但是  现在看来
<15-4,RYAN>but, ah, under the circumstances...

379
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,960
<15-5,ESPOSITO>一般情况下  我会为他们开心的
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Normally, I'd be happy for them.

380
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,140
<15-6,RYAN>是啊
<15-6,RYAN>Yeah. Hey.

381
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,400
<15-6,RYAN>你不会真觉得
<15-6,RYAN>You don't really think

382
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,360
<15-6,RYAN>卡塞尔和这件事有关系吧
<15-6,RYAN>that Castle had anything to do with this, do you?

383
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,650
<15-7,ESPOSITO>当然不会  伙计  他也是我哥们儿
<15-7,ESPOSITO>No. Come on, man. He's my friend, too.

384
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,070
<15-7,ESPOSITO>我们能做的就是证明证据是错的
<15-7,ESPOSITO>The best thing we can do is try to prove this evidence wrong.

385
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,330
<15-7,ESPOSITO>是啊
<15-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

386
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,610
<15-8,RYAN>哈维
<15-8,RYAN>Hey, Javi.

387
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,920
<16-1,CASTLE>等等
<16-1,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

388
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,450
<16-1,CASTLE>我是不是办了派对  结果自己忘了
<16-1,CASTLE>Did I throw a party and forget again?

389
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,880
<16-2,ESPOSITO>这不是派对
<16-2,ESPOSITO>It's not a party.

390
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,440
<16-3,CASTLE>搜查证  手套
<16-3,CASTLE>Search warrant, gloves...

391
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,630
<16-3,CASTLE>好了  伙计们
<16-3,CASTLE>Okay, guys,

392
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,860
<16-3,CASTLE>我明白  指纹那回事儿嘛
<16-3,CASTLE>I get it-- the fingerprint thing.

393
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,610
<16-3,CASTLE>对不住了  下次一定注意  你们可以撤了
<16-3,CASTLE>I'm sorry. Lesson learned. You can all go home.

394
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,220
<16-4,ESPOSITO>这不是开玩笑  兄弟
<16-4,ESPOSITO>It's not a joke, bro.

395
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,990
<16-5,RYAN>带他到厨房
<16-5,RYAN>Take him to the kitchen.

396
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,910
<16-6,CASTLE>厨房  我刚刚
<16-6,CASTLE>The kitchen? I just--

398
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,740
<16-7,CASTLE>贝克特  怎么回事
<16-7,CASTLE>Beckett, what is this?

399
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,250
<16-8,BECKETT>我们在泰莎的公寓找到了一件珠宝
<16-8,BECKETT>We found a piece of jewelry in Tessa's apartment

400
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,830
<16-8,BECKETT>我们追查到了给她买珠宝的男人
<16-8,BECKETT>and we traced it back to the man that bought it for her.

401
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,600
<16-8,BECKETT>就是你  卡塞尔
<16-8,BECKETT>Castle, it was you.

402
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,180
<16-9,CASTLE>你说什么呢
<16-9,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

403
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,300
<16-10,BECKETT>是以12780元的支票买下的
<16-10,BECKETT>It was purchased with a Cashier's check for $12,780.

404
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,880
<16-10,BECKETT>同一天  你从账户中
<16-10,BECKETT>Earlier that day, you withdrew the same amount of money

405
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,450
<16-10,BECKETT>提取了同等额度的支票资金
<16-10,BECKETT>from your pocket account as a cashier's check.

406
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,850
<16-11,CASTLE>你查过我的财务了
<16-11,CASTLE>You looked into my financials?

407
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,960
<16-11,CASTLE>你在调查我
<16-11,CASTLE>You're investigating me?

408
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,130
<16-13,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -凯特  这不是我
<16-13,CASTLE>- Castle - Kate, this is not me.

409
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,440
<16-13,CASTLE>我没买任何珠宝
<16-13,CASTLE>And I didn't buy any jewelry.

410
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,910
<16-13,CASTLE>我也绝没有用支票
<16-13,CASTLE>I certainly didn't use a cashier's check.

411
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,860
<16-14,BECKETT>那你就要好好解释解释了
<16-14,BECKETT>Then you need to explain it.

412
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,880
<16-14,BECKETT>这个  提款  指纹
<16-14,BECKETT>This, the withdrawal, the fingerprint--

413
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,040
<16-14,BECKETT>你得告诉我究竟是怎么回事
<16-14,BECKETT>You need to tell me what the hell's going on.

415
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,270
<16-15,RYAN>这里
<16-15,RYAN>In here.

416
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,840
<16-16,CASTLE>是什么
<16-16,CASTLE>What is it?

417
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,640
<16-16,CASTLE>伙计们  到底是什么
<16-16,CASTLE>Guys, what is it?

418
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,030
<16-16,CASTLE>凯特
<16-16,CASTLE>Kate.

419
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,000
<16-16,CASTLE>理查德·卡塞尔
<16-16,CASTLE>Richard Castle,

420
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,420
<16-17,ESPOSITO>你因涉嫌谋杀泰莎·霍顿而被捕了
<16-17,ESPOSITO>You're under arrest for the murder of Tessa Horton.

421
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,910
<16-17,ESPOSITO>转过身去
<16-17,ESPOSITO>Turn around.

422
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,890
<16-18,ESPOSITO>你有权保持沉默
<16-18,ESPOSITO>You have the right to remain silent.

423
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,470
<16-18,ESPOSITO>但你说的每一句话都将作为呈堂证供
<16-18,ESPOSITO>Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

424
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,190
<17-1,ESPOSITO>这个包是他拥有的书包套装之一
<17-1,ESPOSITO>The bag is part of a set that he owns.

425
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,670
<17-2,RYAN>电线和钩子同捆绑被害人的东西
<17-2,RYAN>The wire and hooks are identical

426
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,130
<17-2,RYAN>是一致的
<17-2,RYAN>to the ones used to bind the victim.

427
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,480
<17-2,RYAN>里面还有一件衬衫
<17-2,RYAN>There was also a shirt inside

428
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,110
<17-2,RYAN>上面沾有血迹
<17-2,RYAN>that had some blood spatter on it.

429
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,240
<17-3,ESPOSITO>实验室说与泰莎的血吻合
<17-3,ESPOSITO>The lab says it's a match to tessa's.

430
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,100
<17-4,GATES>他怎么说的
<17-4,GATES>What's he saying?

431
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,080
<17-5,RYAN>他以前从来没有见过这些
<17-5,RYAN>That he's never seen any of it before in his life.

432
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,680
<17-6,BECKETT>长官  他不会杀人的
<17-6,BECKETT>Sir, he's not a killer.

433
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,620
<17-7,GATES>那你对此如何解释
<17-7,GATES>Then how do you explain all of this?

434
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,190
<17-8,BECKETT>证据不能代表一切
<17-8,BECKETT>The evidence isn't the whole story.

435
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,540
<17-8,BECKETT>这是卡塞尔教会我的
<17-8,BECKETT>Castle's taught me that.

436
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,380
<17-9,GATES>虽然我一直不怎么喜欢卡塞尔先生
<17-9,GATES>You know, I'm not always a fan of Mr. Castle's, Detective,

437
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,880
<17-9,GATES>但是我也难以相信
<17-9,GATES>But even I'm having trouble believing

438
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,200
<17-9,GATES>他会做出如此穷凶极恶之事
<17-9,GATES>He'd do something so heinous.

439
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,860
<17-10,BECKETT>那我们怎么办
<17-10,BECKETT>So then what do we do?

440
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,320
<17-11,GATES>做好我们的工作
<17-11,GATES>Our jobs.

441
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,960
<17-11,GATES>检查他的电子邮件  电脑文件  通话记录
<17-11,GATES>Check his e-mails, computer files, and phone records.

442
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,190
<17-11,GATES>如果他和这个女孩有关系
<17-11,GATES>If he was involved with this girl,

443
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,500
<17-11,GATES>一定会留下记录的
<17-11,GATES>There's bound to be a record.

444
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,210
<17-11,GATES>贝克特  你去和家人谈
<17-11,GATES>Beckett, you talk to the family,

445
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,300
<17-11,GATES>看看还有谁能进入他家
<17-11,GATES>See if anyone else has access to his place.

446
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,970
<17-13,BECKETT>长官
<17-13,BECKETT>Sir.

447
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,760
<17-13,BECKETT>谢谢你
<17-13,BECKETT>Thank you.

448
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,160
<17-14,GATES>先别急着谢我  探长
<17-14,GATES>Don't thank me yet, detective.

449
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,010
<17-14,GATES>不论证据导向哪里我们都要追查下去
<17-14,GATES>We're gonna follow the evidence no matter where it leads us.

450
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,340
<17-15,BECKETT>你们查看卡塞尔通话记录的时候
<17-15,BECKETT>You guys, when you look through Castle's phone records--

451
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,790
<17-15,BECKETT>没事的
<17-15,BECKETT>It's okay.

452
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,230
<17-16,ESPOSITO>我们知道了
<17-16,ESPOSITO>We know.

453
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,800
<17-17,RYAN>不到万不得已我们不会告诉盖茨
<17-17,RYAN>We won't tell Gates unless we have to.

454
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,450
<17-18,BECKETT>你们知道了
<17-18,BECKETT>You know?

455
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,820
<17-19,ESPOSITO>怎么知道的
<17-19,ESPOSITO>How?

456
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,190
<17-19,ESPOSITO>你想想我们多神通广大啊  所以
<17-19,ESPOSITO>Well, I mean, it-- it's us, so...

457
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,700
<17-20,RYAN>我们不说是因为清楚
<17-20,RYAN>We didn't say anything because we figured

458
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,450
<17-20,RYAN>这与其他人无关  但我们还是得问
<17-20,RYAN>it was nobody's business, but we gotta ask,

459
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,590
<17-20,RYAN>你当晚跟他在一起吗
<17-20,RYAN>were you with him that night?

460
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,250
<17-20,RYAN>没
<17-20,RYAN>No. Uh...

461
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,080
<17-21,BECKETT>他
<17-21,BECKETT>He, uh...

462
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,510
<17-21,BECKETT>我应该在那儿的
<17-21,BECKETT>I-I was supposed to be.

463
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,410
<17-21,BECKETT>他母亲出了城
<17-21,BECKETT>His, um, mom was out of town,

464
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,800
<17-21,BECKETT>然后他说需要一点时间写书
<17-21,BECKETT>And then he said that he needed time to write.

465
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
<18-1,CASTLE>贝克特去哪了
<18-1,CASTLE>Where's Beckett?

466
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,030
<18-2,GATES>在这种情况下
<18-2,GATES>Under the circumstances,

467
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,360
<18-2,GATES>我觉得我来审讯最合适
<18-2,GATES>I think it's best if I handle the interrogation.

468
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,250
<18-3,CASTLE>拜托  警监  这太离谱了
<18-3,CASTLE>Come on, Captain. This is insane.

469
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,290
<18-3,CASTLE>我什么都没做过
<18-3,CASTLE>I didn't do anything.

470
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,530
<18-4,GATES>审讯还是必需的
<18-4,GATES>Well, we still need to investigate,

471
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,360
<18-4,GATES>这个你懂
<18-4,GATES>and you know that,

472
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,390
<18-4,GATES>先说说你跟被害人的关系吧
<18-4,GATES>so let's start with your relationship to the victim.

473
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,780
<18-5,CASTLE>好的  我跟她没关系
<18-5,CASTLE>Okay. I didn't have one.

474
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,970
<18-6,GATES>知不知道为什么你的指纹会出现在
<18-6,GATES>Then any idea how your fingerprints ended up

475
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,130
<18-6,GATES>犯罪现场
<18-6,GATES>at the crime scene?

476
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,820
<18-7,CASTLE>我们已经确认是鉴证组搞错了
<18-7,CASTLE>Well, we went over that. C.S.U. made a mistake.

477
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,350
<18-8,GATES>他们说没有
<18-8,GATES>They say they didn't.

478
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,930
<18-8,GATES>卡塞尔  如果你认识她
<18-8,GATES>Castle, if you knew her--

479
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,300
<18-9,CASTLE>我不认识她
<18-9,CASTLE>I didn't know her.

480
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,650
<18-10,GATES>她在跟某人交往
<18-10,GATES>She was seeing someone,

481
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,590
<18-10,GATES>她的室友形容那人又帅又多金
<18-10,GATES>someone her roommate described as handsome and rich.

482
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,300
<18-11,CASTLE>真是过奖了  但那人不是我
<18-11,CASTLE>I'm flattered, but it wasn't me.

483
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,570
<18-11,CASTLE>探长
<18-11,CASTLE>Detective.

484
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,310
<18-12,OFFICER>他的家人来了
<18-12,OFFICER>His family's here.

485
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,790
<19-2,ALEXIS>-理查德人呢  -出什么事了
<19-2,ALEXIS>- Where's Richard? - What's going on?

486
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,070
<19-2,ALEXIS>上面当然有我的指纹  这是我的包
<19-2,ALEXIS>Of course it has my fingerprints on it. It's my bag.

487
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,560
<20-1,CASTLE>但我没有放那些东西进去
<20-1,CASTLE>But I didn't put that stuff in there.

488
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,940
<20-2,GATES>那是谁做的
<20-2,GATES>Then who did?

489
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,270
<20-2,GATES>是不是科茨曼
<20-2,GATES>What about Kurtzman?

490
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,380
<20-3,CASTLE>我们知道当晚他在她家
<20-3,CASTLE>We know he was at her apartment that night,

491
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,450
<20-3,CASTLE>他还撒了谎
<20-3,CASTLE>and he lied about it.

492
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,950
<20-4,GATES>科茨曼的不在场证明成立了
<20-4,GATES>Kurtzman alibied out.

493
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,660
<20-5,CASTLE>什么  什么时候
<20-5,CASTLE>What? When?

494
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,910
<20-6,GATES>一小时之前
<20-6,GATES>An hour ago.

495
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,530
<20-6,GATES>他的律师让他配合调查了
<20-6,GATES>His lawyer got him to cooperate.

496
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,730
<20-6,GATES>-其实他是被引诱去的  -被引诱
<20-6,GATES>- Turns out, he was lured there. - Lured?

497
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,690
<20-8,GATES>泰莎发了条短信给他
<20-8,GATES>By a text message Tessa sent,

498
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,210
<20-8,GATES>只不过这不是她发的
<20-8,GATES>Only it wasn't from Tessa.

499
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,470
<20-8,GATES>用一次性手机
<20-8,GATES>It was from a burner phone.

500
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,820
<20-8,GATES>科茨曼到泰莎那儿后
<20-8,GATES>When Kurtzman showed up at Tessa's,

501
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,120
<20-8,GATES>她说她并没有发过短信
<20-8,GATES>she told him that she didn't send it,

502
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,950
<20-8,GATES>于是就让他走了
<20-8,GATES>so she sent him on his way.

503
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,750
<20-9,CASTLE>那他为什么要撒谎呢
<20-9,CASTLE>Well, then why did he lie about it?

504
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,180
<20-10,GATES>因为余下的整晚他都跟应招女在一起
<20-10,GATES>Because he spent the rest of the evening with a paid companion

505
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,350
<20-10,GATES>不想让他妻子知道
<20-10,GATES>and didn't want his wife to know.

506
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,880
<20-10,GATES>那么
<20-10,GATES>So...

507
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,750
<20-11,GATES>你呢  卡塞尔先生
<20-11,GATES>What about you, Mr. Castle?

508
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,650
<20-11,GATES>谋杀当晚你在哪里
<20-11,GATES>Where were you the night of the murder?

509
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,390
<20-12,CASTLE>我在家里写书
<20-12,CASTLE>I was at home writing.

510
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,990
<20-13,GATES>有人在那儿看见你了吗
<20-13,GATES>And did anyone see you there?

511
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,840
<20-14,CASTLE>没有  我
<20-14,CASTLE>No, I was...

512
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,220
<20-14,CASTLE>一个人
<20-14,CASTLE>Alone.

513
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,230
<20-15,GATES>声明一下
<20-15,GATES>So for the record,

514
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,100
<20-15,GATES>你说你没有不在场证明
<20-15,GATES>You're saying you have no alibi.

515
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,050
<20-16,CASTLE>我要见我的律师
<20-16,CASTLE>I think I'd like my lawyer now.

516
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,350
<21-1,MARTHA>太疯狂了
<21-1,MARTHA>Well, this is madness.

517
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,760
<21-1,MARTHA>这太疯狂了
<21-1,MARTHA>This is just madness.

518
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,140
<21-2,BECKETT>暂时如此  我们会查明真相
<21-2,BECKETT>It's temporary. We just need to find out the truth.

519
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,450
<21-2,BECKETT>有谁能进入你们家
<21-2,BECKETT>Now can anyone else access your apartment?

520
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,570
<21-2,BECKETT>谁还有钥匙
<21-2,BECKETT>Does anyone have keys?

521
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,230
<21-3,MARTHA>艾丽西亚  管家
<21-3,MARTHA>Well, Alicia, the housekeeper.

522
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,870
<21-4,ALEXIS>但她跟了我们十五年了
<21-4,ALEXIS>Yeah, but she's been with us for 15 years.

523
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,190
<21-4,ALEXIS>还有安保系统
<21-4,ALEXIS>And there's a security system.

524
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,320
<21-4,ALEXIS>即使有人用钥匙  警报都会响
<21-4,ALEXIS>Even if someone had a key, the alarm would go off.

525
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,000
<21-5,BECKETT>你们有没有注意到楼里最近
<21-5,BECKETT>Have you noticed anyone out of the ordinary

526
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,820
<21-5,BECKETT>有什么可疑人物出没  比如维修工
<21-5,BECKETT>in the building lately-- a maintenance worker,

527
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,340
<21-5,BECKETT>送货员  任何可能进去的人
<21-5,BECKETT>delivery man, anyone that could've been casing the place?

528
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,760
<21-6,MARTHA>不不  没有
<21-6,MARTHA>No, no, no, no. Nothing.

529
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,640
<22-1,CASTLE>谢谢  我留在这里
<22-1,CASTLE>Thanks. I'll be here.

530
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,570
<22-3,CASTLE>卡塞尔  不论谁在幕后操控
<22-3,CASTLE>Castle, whoever is behind this,

531
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,800
<22-4,BECKETT>不论发生什么
<22-4,BECKETT>Whatever is going on,

532
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,900
<22-4,BECKETT>我都会找出来  我保证
<22-4,BECKETT>I will figure this out. I promise.

533
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,210
<22-5,CASTLE>我知道
<22-5,CASTLE>I know.

534
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,330
<22-6,BECKETT>与此同时  有人来看你了
<22-6,BECKETT>In the meantime, you have some visitors.

535
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,370
<22-7,ALEXIS>老爸
<22-7,ALEXIS>Dad.

536
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,670
<22-8,MARTHA>理查德
<22-8,MARTHA>Oh, Richard.

537
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,710
<22-8,MARTHA>亲爱的
<22-8,MARTHA>Oh, darling.

538
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,880
<22-8,MARTHA>什么
<22-8,MARTHA>What?

539
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,560
<23-1,RYAN>技术部刚刚查完卡塞尔的电脑
<23-1,RYAN>Tech just finished with Castle's computer.

540
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,690
<23-1,RYAN>部分数据被抹掉了  跟泰莎的一样
<23-1,RYAN>Parts of it had been wiped, just like Tessa's.

541
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,690
<23-2,BECKETT>他们能恢复数据吗
<23-2,BECKETT>Were they able to re-- recover anything?

542
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,980
<23-3,ESPOSITO>他们找到一个他删除的文件
<23-3,ESPOSITO>They found a file that he had deleted.

543
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,360
<23-3,ESPOSITO>是一个故事  写如何做到完美谋杀
<23-3,ESPOSITO>It was a story concept about how to commit the perfect murder.

544
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,740
<23-4,RYAN>贝克特  故事人物用奇异的犯罪现场布置
<23-4,RYAN>Beckett, the character gets away with it

545
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,150
<23-4,RYAN>逃脱了处罚
<23-4,RYAN>by staging a crime scene so bizarre,

546
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,060
<23-4,RYAN>他就躲在警察的鼻子底下逍遥法外
<23-4,RYAN>The cops can't see he's hiding right under their noses.

547
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,190
<23-5,ESPOSITO>就像是在纸上的预演
<23-5,ESPOSITO>It was like a-a dry run on paper,

548
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,940
<23-5,ESPOSITO>就连被害人前额
<23-5,ESPOSITO>all the way down to the weird symbol

549
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,550
<23-5,ESPOSITO>找到的怪异符号都一样
<23-5,ESPOSITO>that we found on the victim's forehead.

550
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,830
<23-6,RYAN>还从他的硬盘里发现了
<23-6,RYAN>We found something else on his drive.

551
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,820
<23-6,RYAN>电子邮件  几十封
<23-6,RYAN>E-mails... dozens of 'em,

552
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,200
<23-6,RYAN>往来于卡塞尔和被害人之间
<23-6,RYAN>between Castle and the victim.

553
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,440
<23-6,RYAN>贝克特
<23-6,RYAN>Beckett...

554
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,170
<23-7,ESPOSITO>他们在交往
<23-7,ESPOSITO>They've been having an affair.

555
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,800
<24-1,BECKETT>他们大约八个星期前开始的
<24-1,BECKETT>They started up about eight weeks ago

556
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,280
<24-1,BECKETT>根据这些电子邮件显示
<24-1,BECKETT>According to those e-mails.

557
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,180
<24-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔在一次签售会后遇见了她
<24-1,BECKETT>He met her after one of his... book signings,

558
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,490
<24-1,BECKETT>然后请她去喝咖啡
<24-1,BECKETT>and he asked her out for coffee,

559
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,470
<24-1,BECKETT>那时
<24-1,BECKETT>and that was...

560
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,970
<24-1,BECKETT>那时我们才刚刚开始
<24-1,BECKETT>That was just a couple of weeks

561
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,990
<24-1,BECKETT>恋爱一个星期
<24-1,BECKETT>after we started seeing each other.

562
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,310
<24-2,LANIE>亲爱的
<24-2,LANIE>Oh, sweetie.

563
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,430
<24-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔告诉她不能被别人发现
<24-3,BECKETT>He told her that he needed to keep it a secret

564
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,400
<24-3,BECKETT>因为他有女朋友了
<24-3,BECKETT>because he was with someone else.

565
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,580
<24-3,BECKETT>大约一个星期前卡塞尔想要分手
<24-3,BECKETT>And then when he tried to break it off about a week ago,

566
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,700
<24-3,BECKETT>她就威胁要去告诉他的女朋友
<24-3,BECKETT>she threatened to go and tell his girlfriend.

567
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,250
<24-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔提出让她去他家
<24-3,BECKETT>He offered to come over to her apartment

568
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,810
<24-3,BECKETT>把事情说开
<24-3,BECKETT>to talk things through,

569
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,150
<24-3,BECKETT>也就是她被害的那天晚上
<24-3,BECKETT>and that was the night of the murder.

570
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,660
<24-4,LANIE>他有杀人的动机
<24-4,LANIE>He had motive.

571
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,870
<24-4,LANIE>卡塞尔是怎么说的
<24-4,LANIE>What did Castle say when you talked to him?

572
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,320
<24-5,BECKETT>他说这些电子邮件是假的
<24-5,BECKETT>He said that the e-mails were faked.

573
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,530
<24-5,BECKETT>他从没写过那个情节
<24-5,BECKETT>He said he never wrote that story,

574
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,210
<24-5,BECKETT>他说他是被陷害的
<24-5,BECKETT>and that he was being framed.

575
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,750
<24-5,BECKETT>你要是见到他你就明白了  蕾妮
<24-5,BECKETT>You should've seen him, Lanie.

576
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,020
<24-5,BECKETT>他看上去就像个小孩子  感到十分害怕
<24-5,BECKETT>He looked like a little boy, he was so scared.

577
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,560
<24-5,BECKETT>我了解他  蕾妮
<24-5,BECKETT>I know him, Lanie.

578
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,400
<24-5,BECKETT>他是个
<24-5,BECKETT>He is...

579
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,300
<24-5,BECKETT>长不大  又任性
<24-5,BECKETT>an immature, egotistical...

580
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,670
<24-5,BECKETT>以自我为中心  有时很混蛋的一个人
<24-5,BECKETT>self-centered jackass sometimes,

581
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,260
<24-5,BECKETT>但他决不会杀人
<24-5,BECKETT>but he's not this.

582
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,090
<24-6,LANIE>你真这么觉得
<24-6,LANIE>Are you sure?

583
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,940
<25-1,JERRY TYSON>据说只有狗才能嗅到恐惧
<25-1,JERRY TYSON>They say dogs can smell fear.

584
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,880
<25-1,JERRY TYSON>但你知道吗  有的人也能
<25-1,JERRY TYSON>Did you know that some humans can as well?

585
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,430
<25-1,JERRY TYSON>你现在就散发着恐惧的味道
<25-1,JERRY TYSON>You reek of it.

587
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,650
<25-2,CASTLE>泰森
<25-2,CASTLE>Tyson.

588
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,280
<25-3,TYSON>还是叫我3XK吧
<25-3,TYSON>I prefer 3XK.

589
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,900
<25-3,TYSON>自从上次我把你和莱恩警探丢在汽车旅馆
<25-3,TYSON>How long has it been since I left you

590
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,960
<25-3,TYSON>已经过去多长时间了
<25-3,TYSON>and Detective Ryan in that motel room?

591
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,390
<25-4,CASTLE>来人啊  快来人啊  快来救我啊
<25-4,CASTLE>Somebody! Help! Somebody! I need some help in here!

592
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,400
<25-5,TYSON>他们听不见
<25-5,TYSON>They can't hear you

593
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,990
<25-5,TYSON>也看不见你
<25-5,TYSON>or see you.

594
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,150
<25-5,TYSON>我想这方面我做得还是挺彻底的
<25-5,TYSON>I'm afraid I'm much more thorough than that.

595
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,210
<25-6,CASTLE>这一切都是你干的
<25-6,CASTLE>You did this.

596
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,740
<25-6,CASTLE>你杀了泰莎
<25-6,CASTLE>You killed Tessa.

597
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,840
<25-7,TYSON>她不是我喜欢的类型  我喜欢金发的
<25-7,TYSON>She's not my type. I prefer blondes.

598
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
<25-7,TYSON>还记得吗
<25-7,TYSON>Remember?

599
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,390
<25-7,TYSON>大家更愿意相信
<25-7,TYSON>Here's a much more believable story--

600
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,410
<25-6,CASTLE>是你杀了泰莎
<25-6,CASTLE>You killed Tessa.

601
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,430
<25-7,TYSON>这情节一说就通
<25-7,TYSON>It practically writes itself.

602
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,020
<25-7,TYSON>毕竟  你每天都在心里为你的小说
<25-7,TYSON>After all, you commit murder every day in your mind

603
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,100
<25-7,TYSON>构思怎么犯罪
<25-7,TYSON>for your books.

604
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,980
<25-7,TYSON>不难想象你终于有一天
<25-7,TYSON>It's not hard to imagine that you'd eventually...

605
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,730
<25-7,TYSON>付诸实现了
<25-7,TYSON>cross the line.

606
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,700
<25-8,CASTLE>你为什么要这么做  泰森
<25-8,CASTLE>Why are you doing this, Tyson?

607
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,870
<25-9,TYSON>四年了  卡塞尔
<25-9,TYSON>Four years, Castle.

608
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,880
<25-9,TYSON>我花了四年的时间
<25-9,TYSON>I gave up four years of my life

609
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,380
<25-9,TYSON>来策划一场完美的人间蒸发的好戏
<25-9,TYSON>planning the perfect vanishing act.

610
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,490
<25-9,TYSON>这样警察就不会再去搜捕我了
<25-9,TYSON>So that the cops would stop looking for me,

611
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,130
<25-9,TYSON>我也就可以重新开始了
<25-9,TYSON>So that I could begin again,

612
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,830
<25-9,TYSON>重新开始杀人了
<25-9,TYSON>Could begin killing again

613
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,530
<25-9,TYSON>我就可以再一次尝到
<25-9,TYSON>So that I could taste that fear...

614
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,480
<25-9,TYSON>恐惧的味道
<25-9,TYSON>again.

615
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,330
<25-9,TYSON>我辛苦了四年
<25-9,TYSON>Four years.

616
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,110
<25-9,TYSON>你却毁了一切
<25-9,TYSON>You ruined it.

617
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,210
<25-10,CASTLE>如果要想要的是报复
<25-10,CASTLE>Well, if it's revenge you wanted,

618
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,520
<25-10,CASTLE>为什么不直接杀了我
<25-10,CASTLE>why not just kill me?

619
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,880
<25-11,TYSON>那还有什么乐子
<25-11,TYSON>Where's the fun in that?

620
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,070
<25-11,TYSON>不不不  毁了你比杀了你更有意思
<25-11,TYSON>Oh, no, no, it's more fun to destroy you.

621
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,760
<25-11,TYSON>要不你觉得我那天晚上为什么不杀了你呢
<25-11,TYSON>Why do you think I let you live that night in the motel?

622
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,700
<25-11,TYSON>别人都以为我喜欢的是杀人
<25-11,TYSON>People think it's killing that I like,

623
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,060
<25-11,TYSON>其实杀人只是一个结果
<25-11,TYSON>But murder's just an act.

624
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,690
<25-11,TYSON>最刺激的是你的期望  你的计划
<25-11,TYSON>It's all about the anticipation, the planning.

625
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,060
<25-11,TYSON>看着你和女儿散步
<25-11,TYSON>Watching you and your daughter taking a walk,

626
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,800
<25-11,TYSON>和贝克特做爱
<25-11,TYSON>You and Beckett making love...

627
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,920
<25-11,TYSON>随意出入你的家
<25-11,TYSON>Standing in your living room,

628
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,600
<25-11,TYSON>潜伏到你的生活中
<25-11,TYSON>being inside your life,

629
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,500
<25-11,TYSON>想到你的这一切都会被我毁掉
<25-11,TYSON>Knowing that I'm gonna take it all away from you...

630
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,960
<25-11,TYSON>这才是我喜欢的部分
<25-11,TYSON>that's what I like.

631
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,770
<25-12,CASTLE>你是逃不掉的
<25-12,CASTLE>You won't get away with this.

632
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,790
<25-13,TYSON>得了吧
<25-13,TYSON>Oh, please.

633
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,240
<25-13,TYSON>你还能做什么  你跟他们说我来过这儿
<25-13,TYSON>What are you gonna do, you gonna tell 'em that I came here?

634
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,860
<25-13,TYSON>你觉得他们会相信一个
<25-13,TYSON>You think that they're gonna

635
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,800
<25-13,TYSON>极度绝望的人的话吗
<25-13,TYSON>believe the lies of a desperate man?

636
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,410
<25-14,CASTLE>贝克特会的
<25-14,CASTLE>Beckett will.

637
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,400
<25-15,TYSON>即使她相信
<25-15,TYSON>Well, even if she does...

638
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,710
<25-15,TYSON>她也救不了你
<25-15,TYSON>She can't save you.

639
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,500
<25-15,TYSON>因为没有时间了
<25-15,TYSON>There's no time.

640
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,880
<25-15,TYSON>明天检察官就会对你提起指控
<25-15,TYSON>When the D.A. files charges tomorrow,

641
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,870
<25-15,TYSON>他们会把你送到扣押中心
<25-15,TYSON>They're gonna send you to central booking--

642
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
<25-15,TYSON>那里被人称为坟墓
<25-15,TYSON>The tombs.

643
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,120
<25-15,TYSON>那儿有我的朋友
<25-15,TYSON>I have people waiting...

644
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,550
<25-15,TYSON>在等着你
<25-15,TYSON>for you.

645
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,680
<25-15,TYSON>你连一个晚上都活不过
<25-15,TYSON>You will not last the night.

646
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,070
<25-15,TYSON>这是对她的惩罚
<25-15,TYSON>And that'll be her punishment--

647
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,770
<25-15,TYSON>相信你是无辜的
<25-15,TYSON>Believing that you were innocent,

648
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,960
<25-15,TYSON>却依然救不了你
<25-15,TYSON>and not being able to stop it.

649
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,570
<25-15,TYSON>这会让她内疚一辈子
<25-15,TYSON>It'll haunt her for the rest of her life.

650
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,110
<25-15,TYSON>你很幸运  因为那时你早就死了
<25-15,TYSON>Lucky for you... you'll be dead.

651
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,310
<26-1,BECKETT>我们检查了昨天晚上的监控录像
<26-1,BECKETT>We went through the surveillance footage from last night.

652
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,810
<26-1,BECKETT>没有证据显示杰瑞·泰森昨晚出现在警局
<26-1,BECKETT>There's no evidence that Jerry Tyson was in the station,

653
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,240
<26-1,BECKETT>也没有证据显示
<26-1,BECKETT>and there is no evidence

654
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,420
<26-1,BECKETT>我们的监控系统被篡改过
<26-1,BECKETT>that the system had been tampered with.

655
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,060
<26-2,CASTLE>贝克特  我向你发誓  他昨晚来过这
<26-2,CASTLE>Beckett, I swear to you, he was here.

656
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,150
<26-3,BECKETT>-卡塞尔 -我知道  这听起来不可思议
<26-3,BECKETT>- Castle. - No, I know. I sound crazy.

657
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,550
<26-4,CASTLE>就像一个绝望的人说的绝望的话  就像
<26-4,CASTLE>A desperate story from a desperate man, just...

658
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,630
<26-4,CASTLE>就像他所期望的
<26-4,CASTLE>just like he wanted.

659
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,460
<26-5,BECKETT>你说的没错  听起来是很绝望
<26-5,BECKETT>You're right, it does sound desperate.

660
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,340
<26-5,BECKETT>但是这件事终于能讲得通了
<26-5,BECKETT>But it's the first time that this story has made sense.

661
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,340
<26-6,CASTLE>你相信我
<26-6,CASTLE>You believe me?

662
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,600
<26-7,BECKETT>我一直相信
<26-7,BECKETT>I never stopped.

663
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,000
<26-8,CASTLE>他要杀我  凯特
<26-8,CASTLE>He's gonna kill me, Kate.

664
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,770
<26-8,CASTLE>我跑不了  也躲不了
<26-8,CASTLE>I can't run, I can't hide.

665
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,690
<26-8,CASTLE>我该怎么办
<26-8,CASTLE>What am I supposed to do?

666
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,300
<27-1,BECKETT>我告诉你  是三重杀手干的
<27-1,BECKETT>I'm telling you, it's the triple killer.

667
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,020
<27-1,BECKETT>勒杀  误导  伪造证据
<27-1,BECKETT>Strangulation, misdirects, planting evidence--

668
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,400
<27-1,BECKETT>都是泰森的手法
<27-1,BECKETT>It's Tyson's M.O.

669
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,810
<27-2,GATES>3XK通常针对多个被害人  且都为女性从来没有男性
<27-2,GATES>3XK targeted multiple victims, always women, never men.

670
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,670
<27-2,GATES>这次为什么不同
<27-2,GATES>So why the change?

671
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,550
<27-3,BECKETT>报仇  这是唯一能解释一切的答案
<27-3,BECKETT>Revenge. That's the only thing that explains everything.

672
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,170
<27-4,GATES>不  不是一切  这解释不了卡塞尔的视频
<27-4,GATES>No, not everything. Not that video of Castle.

673
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,200
<27-5,ESPOSITO>事实上  有可能
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, actually, it might.

674
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,230
<27-6,RYAN>泰森在之前的案子里有过类似的作法
<27-6,RYAN>Tyson did something similar in the Russo case.

675
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,000
<27-6,RYAN>他曾用替身使我们做出错误判断
<27-6,RYAN>He used a double for the cameras to throw us off.

676
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,110
<27-7,BECKETT>长官  地检官已经递交了诉讼
<27-7,BECKETT>Sir, the D.A. has already filed charges.

677
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,130
<27-7,BECKETT>他们今天就会把他送去扣押中心
<27-7,BECKETT>They're gonna send him to Central Booking today.

678
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,670
<27-7,BECKETT>我们定能证明他的阴谋  但我们需要时间
<27-7,BECKETT>We know that we can prove this. We just need more time.

679
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,400
<28-1,ADA TONI GONZALEZ>你要地检办公室做什么
<28-1,ADA TONI GONZALEZ>You want the D.A.'s office to do what?

680
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,660
<28-2,GATES>我们只是要求能暂缓指控以待案情明朗
<28-2,GATES>All we're asking for is a delay until we can sort all this out.

681
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,020
<28-3,GONZALEZ>不  你们要求的是对杀人嫌犯的
<28-3,GONZALEZ>No, what you're asking for is preferential treatment

682
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,280
<28-3,GONZALEZ>特殊优待
<28-3,GONZALEZ>for a murder suspect.

683
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,530
<28-3,GONZALEZ>你们要侦破案子
<28-3,GONZALEZ>You want to sort this out,

684
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,070
<28-3,GONZALEZ>等他被传讯后你们再侦破
<28-3,GONZALEZ>you sort it out after he's arraigned.

685
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,970
<28-4,BECKETT>不  我想你没明白
<28-4,BECKETT>No, I don't think you understand.

686
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,260
<28-4,BECKETT>他会死在里面  根本不会有之后
<28-4,BECKETT>There's not gonna be an after.

687
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,960
<28-5,GONZALEZ>如果你担心的是他的安全问题
<28-5,GONZALEZ>If it's his safety you're concerned about,

688
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,890
<28-5,GONZALEZ>我们会对他进行保护性监禁
<28-5,GONZALEZ>we're prepared to put him in protective custody.

689
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,070
<28-6,BECKETT>你知道你们要对付的人是谁吗
<28-6,BECKETT>Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

690
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,430
<28-6,BECKETT>你知道杰瑞·泰森
<28-6,BECKETT>Do you even know what Jerry Tyson

691
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,270
<28-6,BECKETT>能做出什么事吗
<28-6,BECKETT>has proven himself capable of?

692
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,270
<28-7,GONZALEZ>你以为他在你们手里逃脱后
<28-7,GONZALEZ>Who do you think met with the families of his victims

693
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,310
<28-7,GONZALEZ>是谁安慰了被害人的家属
<28-7,GONZALEZ>and held their hands

694
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,450
<28-7,GONZALEZ>是谁握着他们的手  探长
<28-7,GONZALEZ>when he slipped through your fingers, detective?

695
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,270
<28-7,GONZALEZ>我很清楚3XK能做出什么事
<28-7,GONZALEZ>I'm very aware of what 3XK is capable of.

696
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,910
<28-8,BECKETT>那你应该明白你们的保护性监禁
<28-8,BECKETT>Then you should know that your protective custody

697
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,150
<28-8,BECKETT>根本没用
<28-8,BECKETT>isn't worth a damn.

698
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,290
<28-8,BECKETT>他要是想杀卡塞尔  他总会想到办法的
<28-8,BECKETT>If he wants to kill Castle, he's gonna find a way to do it.

699
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,640
<28-9,GONZALEZ>盖茨警监  除了杀人嫌犯
<28-9,GONZALEZ>Captain Gates, aside from your

700
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,440
<28-9,GONZALEZ>毫无根据的口供之外
<28-9,GONZALEZ>unsubstantiated claim from a murder suspect,

701
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,600
<28-9,GONZALEZ>你能不能向地检提供一点点
<28-9,GONZALEZ>can you offer the D.A.'s office one shred of evidence

702
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,100
<28-9,GONZALEZ>能表明3XK涉案的证据
<28-9,GONZALEZ>of 3XK's inolvement?

703
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,230
<28-10,GATES>暂时不能
<28-10,GATES>Not at this time.

704
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,320
<28-11,GONZALEZ>那没什么好说的了
<28-11,GONZALEZ>Then we're done here.

705
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,220
<29-1,ESPOSITO>我在扣押中心待过
<29-1,ESPOSITO>I've spent some time in Central.

706
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,410
<29-1,ESPOSITO>真心是个坟墓
<29-1,ESPOSITO>I've seen the tombs,

707
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,050
<29-1,ESPOSITO>那里面死人是经常的事
<29-1,ESPOSITO>the way they stack bodies in those cells.

708
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,940
<29-1,ESPOSITO>要是有人悬赏卡塞尔的人头
<29-1,ESPOSITO>If there's a bounty on Castle's head,

709
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,440
<29-1,ESPOSITO>保护性监禁根本就没用
<29-1,ESPOSITO>protective custody ain't gonna do jack.

710
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,000
<29-2,RYAN>那还是假设泰森买通了罪犯
<29-2,RYAN>That's assuming Tyson paid off a prisoner.

711
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,980
<29-2,RYAN>更可怕的是买通了守卫
<29-2,RYAN>It could be a guard.

712
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,080
<29-3,BECKETT>那我们就没办法在那儿保护他
<29-3,BECKETT>So we can't protect him, not there.

713
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,730
<29-4,BECKETT>我们必须阻止转送
<29-4,BECKETT>We have to stop that transfer.

714
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,130
<29-4,BECKETT>我们得找到3XK涉案的证据
<29-4,BECKETT>We need evidence that 3XK was involved.

715
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,530
<29-5,ESPOSITO>是啊  但我们没有线索
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but we got nothing to go on.

716
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,790
<29-6,BECKETT>要实现这一切  他得进入卡塞尔的家
<29-6,BECKETT>Okay, to pull this off, he needed access to Castle's loft.

717
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,990
<29-6,BECKETT>派人去他家  把那里翻个遍
<29-6,BECKETT>So get teams over there and tear that place apart.

718
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,720
<29-6,BECKETT>给我找指纹  窃听器
<29-6,BECKETT>Find me a fingerprint, a hidden microphone,

719
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,170
<29-6,BECKETT>坏了的窗栓  任何能说明他在场的东西
<29-6,BECKETT>a broken window jamb, anything that puts him there.

720
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,970
<29-7,RYAN>泰莎有约会对象  如果不是卡塞尔
<29-7,RYAN>Tessa was seeing someone. If it wasn't Castle...

721
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,410
<29-8,BECKETT>那就可能是泰森
<29-8,BECKETT>Then maybe it was Tyson.

722
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,910
<29-8,BECKETT>去她的办公室
<29-8,BECKETT>Hit her office.

723
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,800
<29-8,BECKETT>查文件  日程安排  客户名单
<29-8,BECKETT>Look for files, schedules, client lists.

724
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,590
<29-8,BECKETT>肯定有东西能和他联系起来
<29-8,BECKETT>There's gotta be something that ties back to him.

725
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,810
<30-1,ESPOSITO>我刚听完卡塞尔家那组的报告
<30-1,ESPOSITO>I just heard from the team at Castle's loft.

726
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,330
<30-1,ESPOSITO>没发现什么
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Nothing yet.

727
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,790
<30-2,BECKETT>真会像泰森说的那样吗
<30-2,BECKETT>So it's gonna happen just like Tyson said, huh?

728
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,460
<30-2,BECKETT>我没办法及时救下他
<30-2,BECKETT>I'm not gonna be able to save him in time.

729
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,830
<30-3,ESPOSITO>我们还没查完呢
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Well, we're not done yet.

730
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,080
<30-4,BECKETT>看守管得严吗
<30-4,BECKETT>How secure is holding?

731
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,970
<30-5,ESPOSITO>什么  你可不能打这个主意
<30-5,ESPOSITO>What? Whoa. You're not even thinking about that.

732
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,890
<30-6,BECKETT>这事关他的性命  不能让他们带走他
<30-6,BECKETT>We're talking about his life. We can't let them take him.

733
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,400
<30-7,ESPOSITO>你疯了吗  这不可能的
<30-7,ESPOSITO>Are you crazy? It would never work.

734
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,560
<30-7,ESPOSITO>你根本就躲不过看守
<30-7,ESPOSITO>You'll never even get out of holding.

735
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,320
<30-8,BECKETT>泰森就做到过
<30-8,BECKETT>Tyson did it.

736
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,790
<30-9,ESPOSITO>那是因为没人注意他
<30-9,ESPOSITO>Because nobody was looking for him.

737
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,900
<30-9,ESPOSITO>他周密计划了好几个星期  甚至更久
<30-9,ESPOSITO>He had weeks to plan it, maybe even longer. Y--

738
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,740
<30-9,ESPOSITO>我知道你对他的感情
<30-9,ESPOSITO>I know how you feel about the guy.

739
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,650
<30-9,ESPOSITO>我也爱他
<30-9,ESPOSITO>I love him, too.

740
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,920
<30-9,ESPOSITO>但我们无能为力
<30-9,ESPOSITO>But there's nothing we can do.

742
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,260
<30-10,GATES>他们来了
<30-10,GATES>They're here.

743
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,560
<31-1,CASTLE>这可没有上次在你家
<31-1,CASTLE>This is so much less fun

744
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,480
<31-1,CASTLE>那么有意思了
<31-1,CASTLE>than the other night at your place.

745
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,300
<31-1,CASTLE>还记得你第一次拷上我吗
<31-1,CASTLE>Do you remember the first time you handcuffed me?

746
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,790
<31-1,CASTLE>我们在纽约公共图书馆
<31-1,CASTLE>We were at the New York Public Library.

747
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,580
<31-1,CASTLE>还记得你不能阻止我
<31-1,CASTLE>Remember how angry you were

748
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,150
<31-1,CASTLE>调查案子时  你有多生气吗
<31-1,CASTLE>that I wouldn't stop investigating that case?

749
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,760
<31-2,BECKETT>是啊  我记得
<31-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I remember.

750
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,520
<31-3,CASTLE>我真想回到那个时候
<31-3,CASTLE>What I wouldn't give to be there now.

751
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,340
<31-3,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<31-3,CASTLE>Castle...

752
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,370
<31-4,BECKETT>案子还没结呢
<31-4,BECKETT>This isn't over.

753
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,240
<31-4,BECKETT>我保证  我会救你出来
<31-4,BECKETT>I promise you, I will get you out.

754
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,920
<31-5,CASTLE>没关系
<31-5,CASTLE>It's okay.

755
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,100
<31-5,CASTLE>不管发生什么
<31-5,CASTLE>Whatever happens,

756
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,250
<31-5,CASTLE>都没关系
<31-5,CASTLE>It's okay.

757
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,510
<32-1,ESPOSITO>抱歉
<32-1,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry.

758
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,450
<32-2,BECKETT>没必要抱歉  我不需要抱歉
<32-2,BECKETT>Don't be sorry. I don't need sorry.

759
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,690
<32-2,BECKETT>我要把那混蛋找出来
<32-2,BECKETT>I need to find this son of a bitch

760
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,280
<32-2,BECKETT>送他归西
<32-2,BECKETT>and put him in the ground.

761
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,990
<32-3,OFFICER>贝克特探长
<32-3,OFFICER>Detective Beckett.

762
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,080
<32-4,BECKETT>怎么了
<32-4,BECKETT>What?

763
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,770
<32-5,OFFICER>我们奉命来此转押一人去扣押中心
<32-5,OFFICER>We're here to transport one of yours to Central--

764
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,500
<32-5,OFFICER>叫理查德·卡塞尔
<32-5,OFFICER>A, uh, Richard Castle?

765
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,300
<33-1,GATES>对  我是在看转押书...
<33-1,GATES>Yes, I'm looking at the transfer...

766
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,800
<33-2,BECKETT>不  文件上写着警徽号为871324
<33-2,BECKETT>No, the paper work said the bedge number was 871324.

767
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,420
<33-3,GATES>扣押中心说车没有抵达
<33-3,GATES>The Central Booking said it never arraived,

768
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,270
<33-3,GATES>他们也不知道车在哪里
<33-3,GATES>they don't know where the hell it is.

769
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,950
<33-3,GATES>好的
<33-3,GATES>Right. OK.

770
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,290
<33-4,BECKETT>文件上的警徽编号不存在
<33-4,BECKETT>The badge numbers on the paperwork don't exit.

771
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,510
<33-4,BECKETT>他们是假冒的
<33-4,BECKETT>They were imposters.

772
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,130
<33-5,ESPOSITO>一定是泰森干的  他设计好的
<33-5,ESPOSITO>It's gotta be Tyson. He sets this up.

773
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,290
<33-6,BECKETT>他不会让别人杀卡塞尔的
<33-6,BECKETT>He isn't gonna have Castle killed.

774
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,110
<33-6,BECKETT>他想亲手杀死他
<33-6,BECKETT>He's gonna kill him himself.

775
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,360
<33-7,GATES>地方检察官认为这是越狱
<33-7,GATES>Well, the D.A. is calling it a prisoner escape.

776
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,890
<33-7,GATES>他们签发了一张全面通缉令
<33-7,GATES>They've issued an A.P.B

777
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,080
<33-7,GATES>不准我把他捞出来
<33-7,GATES>and restricted me to get the man.

778
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,830
<33-8,ESPOSITO>什么  他们认为是卡塞尔干的吗
<33-8,ESPOSITO>What? They think Castle did this?

779
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,040
<33-9,GATES>按他们的考虑
<33-9,GATES>As far as their concern,

780
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,700
<33-9,GATES>他结交甚广  熟悉流程
<33-9,GATES>he's well connected, knows our procedure,

781
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,530
<33-9,GATES>还有大量的可用资源
<33-9,GATES>and has substantial resources.

782
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,940
<33-10,ESPOSITO>太荒谬了
<33-10,ESPOSITO>That's ridiculous.

783
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,460
<33-11,GATES>你们俩继续查泰森
<33-11,GATES>You two keep working the Tyson angle.

784
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,960
<33-11,GATES>我来处理这个
<33-11,GATES>I've got this.

785
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,030
<33-12,BECKETT>资源
<33-12,BECKETT>Resources.

786
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,460
<33-13,ESPOSITO>你能相信吗
<33-13,ESPOSITO>Can you believe that?

787
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,350
<33-13,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔可能已经被连环杀手
<33-13,ESPOSITO>Branding Castle a fugitive

788
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,810
<33-13,ESPOSITO>劫持了  他们还把他当逃犯
<33-13,ESPOSITO>when he's probably being held captive by a serial killer?

789
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,120
<33-13,ESPOSITO>我们接下来该
<33-13,ESPOSITO>So what's our next...

790
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,900
<33-13,ESPOSITO>干什么

<34-1,BECKETT>感谢上帝  你没事
<34-1,BECKETT>Oh, thank God you're okay.

<34-2,CASTLE>感谢上帝你听懂我说的话了
<34-2,CASTLE>Thank God you understood my message.

793
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,280
<34-3,BECKETT>我第一次拷上你
<34-3,BECKETT>The first time that I cuffed you--

794
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,840
<34-3,BECKETT>你愿付出一切回到那
<34-3,BECKETT>What you wouldn't give to be back there now.

795
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,870
<34-5,BECKETT>-来吧  -好
<34-5,BECKETT>- Come on. - Yeah.

796
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,160
<34-6,CASTLE>我知道  我没法给你打电话
<34-6,CASTLE>I knew I couldn't call once I left.

797
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,600
<34-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔你怎么办到的  怎么逃出来的
<34-7,BECKETT>Castle, how did you do it? How did you escape?

798
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,220
<34-8,CASTLE>-我的律师很厉害  -得了吧
<34-8,CASTLE>- I've got a great lawyer. - Come on.

799
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,140
<34-9,BECKETT>有人欠我人情  你知道的越少越好
<34-9,BECKETT>Someone owned me a favor. The less you know, the better.

800
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,470
<34-10,CASTLE>但好消息是  我还活着
<34-10,CASTLE>But the good news is, I'm still alive.

801
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,970
<34-11,BECKETT>地方检察官通告说你是逃犯了
<34-11,BECKETT>The D.A. has branded you a fugitive.

802
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,910
<34-11,BECKETT>纽约的所有警察都在找你
<34-11,BECKETT>Every cop in New York is looking for you.

803
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,190
<34-12,CASTLE>五点钟的新闻过后
<34-12,CASTLE>Yes, well, they won't be the only ones

804
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,790
<34-12,CASTLE>找我的就不只是警察了
<34-12,CASTLE>after the 5:00 news.

805
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,470
<34-12,CASTLE>他们监视着我的电话  房子和账户
<34-12,CASTLE>And by now they've tagged my phone, my house, my accounts.

806
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,800
<34-12,CASTLE>我逃不了多久  我们得加紧行动
<34-12,CASTLE>I'm not gonna last long out here. We have to act quickly.

807
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,240
<34-13,BECKETT>我安排人去你家查找泰森留下的蛛丝马迹了
<34-13,BECKETT>I've got teams at your place looking for any trace of Tyson.

808
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,550
<34-13,BECKETT>莱恩在彻查泰莎办公室的文件
<34-13,BECKETT>Ryan is wading through paperwork at Tessa's office

809
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,000
<34-13,BECKETT>看能不能查出什么联系来
<34-13,BECKETT>to see if there's a connection.

810
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,360
<34-14,CASTLE>可能得查几周时间  我有个更快的办法
<34-14,CASTLE>Well, that could take weeks. I think I got something better.

811
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,070
<34-14,CASTLE>在牢房里  我一直在想
<34-14,CASTLE>Sitting in holding, I kept thinking,

812
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,980
<34-14,CASTLE>他怎么做到的
<34-14,CASTLE>how could he possibly pull this off?

813
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,280
<34-14,CASTLE>他怎么能弄到我去买耳坠的录像
<34-14,CASTLE>How could he get video of me buying those earrings?

814
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,780
<34-14,CASTLE>后来我突然想到了
<34-14,CASTLE>And then it hit me...

815
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,390
<34-15,BECKETT>《百老汇选角》

<34-16,CASTLE>You want someone to play a role, you cast it.

818
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,690
<34-16,CASTLE>看看这个  四个月前的广告
<34-16,CASTLE>Look at this notice from four months ago

819
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,100
<34-16,CASTLE>一家明星替身公司登的

00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,890
<34-18,CASTLE>看他们都要谁
<34-18,CASTLE>Look who they're looking for.

822
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:11,720

<35-1,CASTING AGENT>对  是我们登的这条广告
<35-1,CASTING AGENT>Yeah, we placed that ad.

827
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,120
<35-1,CASTING AGENT>把几个人的头像发到客户的邮箱里
<35-1,CASTING AGENT>Sent a couple of headshots over to the client's P.O. Box,

828
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,330
<35-1,CASTING AGENT>就没信儿了
<35-1,CASTING AGENT>but never heard back.

829
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,740
<35-2,BECKETT>能把地址给我吗
<35-2,BECKETT>Uh, could I get the address?

830
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,960
<35-3,CASTING AGENT>当然
<35-3,CASTING AGENT>Sure.

831

<35-4,CASTLE>你发过理查德·卡塞尔替身的照片吗
<35-4,CASTLE>And did you send over any Richard Castles?

832
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,610
<35-5,CASTING AGENT>我查查
<35-5,CASTING AGENT>Let me check.

833
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,160
<35-6,CASTING AGENT>只有一个
<35-6,CASTING AGENT>Just one.

834
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,440
<35-7,CASTLE>太好了  我们也需要他的资料
<35-7,CASTLE>Great. We'll need his information as well.

835
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,770
<36-1,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<36-1,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

836
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,250
<36-1,BECKETT>这家公司邮寄头像照片的收信邮箱
<36-1,BECKETT>So the P.O. Box the agency sent the headshots to

837
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,970
<36-1,BECKETT>是用现金租来的  只租了一个月
<36-1,BECKETT>was paid for in cash and rented for a month.

838
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,090
<36-1,BECKETT>邮箱主人没有转寄地址
<36-1,BECKETT>The owners gave no forwarding address.

839
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,470
<36-2,CASTLE>死胡同
<36-2,CASTLE>It's a dead end.

840
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,810
<36-2,CASTLE>泰森或许是条死胡同
<36-2,CASTLE>Well, Tyson might be a dead end,

841
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,430
<36-2,CASTLE>但理查德·卡塞尔可不是
<36-2,CASTLE>but Richard Castle isn't.

842
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,730
<36-2,CASTLE>看啊  那就是我
<36-2,CASTLE>Look, it's me.

843
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,970
<36-2,CASTLE>没错  有时会有人来找我
<36-2,CASTLE>Yeah, people come up sometimes,

844
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,670
<37-1,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>让我给你的书签名
<37-1,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>asking me to sign your books.

845
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,430
<37-1,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>因此我觉得我应该去报名
<37-1,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>So I figured I'd submit.

846
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,500
<37-1,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>从没听到回信
<37-1,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>I never heard back.

847
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,590
<37-2,CASTLE>这么近距离的看
<37-2,CASTLE>You know, uh, now that I'm up close,

848
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,970
<37-2,CASTLE>还真没觉得像
<37-2,CASTLE>I really don't see it.

849
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,540
<37-3,BECKETT>那么
<37-3,BECKETT>Uh... so, uh,

850
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,310
<37-3,BECKETT>这个是你吗
<37-3,BECKETT>I-is this you?

851
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,490
<37-3,BECKETT>是啊
<37-3,BECKETT>Yeah.

852
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,110
<37-4,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>那是个商场安保用的真人秀
<37-4,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>That was for a reality show on store security.

853
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,370
<37-4,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>挺奇怪的  他们让我去买耳坠
<37-4,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>It was an odd gig. They sent me in to buy earrings.

854
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,180
<37-5,BECKETT>有这个人的事吗
<37-5,BECKETT>And was this man involved somehow?

855
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,460
<37-6,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>好像是那个真人秀的制片人
<37-6,CASTLE LOOKALIKE>He looks a little like the show's producer.

856
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,390
<37-7,CASTLE>你不会刚好有他的联系方式吧
<37-7,CASTLE>You wouldn't happen to have his contact information, would you?

857
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,340
<38-1,ESPOSITO>什么叫他和你在一起
<38-1,ESPOSITO>What do you mean, he's with you?

858
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,320
<38-1,ESPOSITO>他怎么逃出来的
<38-1,ESPOSITO>How did he escape?

859
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,700
<38-2,BECKETT>埃斯波  现在别问  我需要一个地址
<38-2,BECKETT>Espo, not now. I need an address.

860
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,870
<38-3,ESPOSITO>好吧  制作人的地址也是假的
<38-3,ESPOSITO>All right, the address for the show's producer is another dead PO box

861
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,340
<38-3,ESPOSITO>电话号码也是空号
<38-3,ESPOSITO>and the phone number's defunct.

862
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,160
<38-4,BECKETT>支付工资的那张支票呢
<38-4,BECKETT>Okay, what about his paycheck?

863
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,460
<38-5,ESPOSITO>我问过银行了
<38-5,ESPOSITO>Well, I talked to the bank,

864
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,850
<38-5,ESPOSITO>支票关联的账户已经销户了
<38-5,ESPOSITO>and the corporate account that cut the check is closed.

865
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,270
<38-5,ESPOSITO>账户联系人
<38-5,ESPOSITO>And the corporate contact,

866
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,810
<38-5,ESPOSITO>约瑟夫·范启尔也不存在
<38-5,ESPOSITO>Joseph Vacher, well, doesn't seem to exist.

867
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,670
<38-6,CASTLE>不  这个人存在  至少存在过
<38-6,CASTLE>Yeah, he exists, all right. Or at least he used to.

868
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,320
<38-6,CASTLE>约瑟夫·范启尔是十九世纪晚期的
<38-6,CASTLE>Joseph Vacher is a famous French serial killer

869
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,580
<38-6,CASTLE>一位著名的法国连环杀手
<38-6,CASTLE>from the late 1800s.

870
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,840
<38-7,ESPOSITO>这么说他还有点幽默感
<38-7,ESPOSITO>So he's got a sense of humor.

871
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,130
<38-8,BECKETT>那个公司账户
<38-8,BECKETT>Have any other checks been written

872
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,740
<38-8,BECKETT>还开出过支票吗
<38-8,BECKETT>from that corporate account?

873
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,130
<38-9,ESPOSITO>没错  给的是
<38-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, cut to a...

874
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,730
<38-9,ESPOSITO>科茨曼保险公司
<38-9,ESPOSITO>Kurtzman Insurance.

875
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,370
<38-10,BECKETT>泰莎在那里工作
<38-10,BECKETT>Tessa worked for them.

876
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,540
<39-1,RYAN>她的公司档案里没提到范启尔
<39-1,RYAN>So there's no mention of Vacher in her policy files...

877
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,700
<39-1,RYAN>不过  在她的日历上
<39-1,RYAN>but there was an entry in her calendar.

878
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,620
<39-1,RYAN>在这儿了
<39-1,RYAN>Yeah, here it is.

879
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,700
<39-1,RYAN>六周前  和一个叫J.V.的人见面
<39-1,RYAN>Six weeks ago-- site visit with a J.V.

880
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,970
<39-2,CASTLE>就是他  肯定是
<39-2,CASTLE>Well, that's him. It has to be.

881
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,310
<39-3,BECKETT>她有没有写别的信息
<39-3,BECKETT>Did she write anything else with it--

882
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,690
<39-3,BECKETT>比如电话号码  电子邮件  地址等
<39-3,BECKETT>a phone number, e-mails, an address?

883
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,780
<39-4,RYAN>没有号码  不过有个地址
<39-4,RYAN>No phone number, but there is an address.

884
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,490
<39-4,RYAN>或许就是他们见面进行考察的地址
<39-4,RYAN>Maybe where they went for the site visit.

885
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,740
<39-4,RYAN>就在北曼哈顿
<39-4,RYAN>Looks like it's in northern Manhattan

886
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,480
<39-4,RYAN>大桥附近
<39-4,RYAN>near the bridge.

887
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,450
<39-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他在假扮大楼所有者
<39-5,BECKETT>Castle, he was posing as a building owner

888
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,350
<39-5,BECKETT>找保险
<39-5,BECKETT>looking for insurance.

889
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,510
<39-5,BECKETT>很有可能他找到了一栋空大楼
<39-5,BECKETT>He probably found an empty property.

890
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,870
<39-5,BECKETT>值得一查
<39-5,BECKETT>Could be worth a look.

891
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,220
<39-5,BECKETT>凯文  带埃斯波到那个地址找我们
<39-5,BECKETT>Kev, hook up with Espo and meet us there.

892
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,120
<39-6,RYAN>没问题
<39-6,RYAN>You got it.

893
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,990
<39-7,CASTLE>有人看了新闻认出我了  快走
<39-7,CASTLE>Someone saw the news. We gotta go.

894
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,440
<40-1,RYAN>户主说这楼没人用
<40-1,RYAN>Owner says it's unoccupied.

895
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,280
<40-1,RYAN>一年没有租出去过了
<40-1,RYAN>Hasn't been a tenant for nearly a year.

896
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,780
<40-2,BECKETT>那是谁在上面
<40-2,BECKETT>Then who's up there?

897
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,170
<40-3,ESPOSITO>可能有人  也可能就是一盏亮着的灯
<40-3,ESPOSITO>Could be someone or it could be just a light.

898
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,030
<40-5,BECKETT>-看到那个动静没  -好了大伙  行动吧
<40-5,BECKETT>- Did you just see that? - All right, guys. Let's move. Come on.

899
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,530
<40-5,BECKETT>没人
<40-5,BECKETT>It was nothing.

900
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,960
<41-1,ESPOSITO>床单罢了
<41-1,ESPOSITO>Just a sheet.

901
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,340
<41-2,BECKETT>大伙
<41-2,BECKETT>You guys.

902
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,800
<41-2,BECKETT>过来看
<41-2,BECKETT>Over here.

903
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,310
<42-1,RYAN>他在卡塞尔的公寓得到他的指纹后
<42-1,RYAN>Once he'd obtained Castle's print from his loft,

904
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,290
<42-1,RYAN>用粘合剂和生胶浆
<42-1,RYAN>he used a binding agent and some rubber cement

905
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,420
<42-1,RYAN>做了一个指纹乳胶手模
<42-1,RYAN>to build a latex model of his fingerprint.

906
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,000
<42-2,BECKETT>监视照片
<42-2,BECKETT>Surveillance photos,

907
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,140
<42-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔家的装修招工广告
<42-2,BECKETT>architectural plans for Castle's loft...

908
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,060
<42-3,RYAN>还有辖区地图
<42-3,RYAN>A precinct map,

909
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,570
<42-3,RYAN>上面标记了所有监控摄像头的位置
<42-3,RYAN>including the locations of all of our video cameras--

910
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,020
<42-3,RYAN>他精心安排了这一切
<42-3,RYAN>He orchestrated everything right down to the last detail.

911
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,680
<42-4,BECKETT>他甚至把科茨曼也拉下水
<42-4,BECKETT>He even implicated Kurtzman

912
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,350
<42-4,BECKETT>让这事看着像是卡塞尔为了隐藏行踪而干的
<42-4,BECKETT>to make it look like Castle was covering his tracks.

913
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,270
<42-4,BECKETT>我不明白
<42-4,BECKETT>I don't get it.

914
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,540
<42-5,GATES>他干嘛费这么大劲陷害你
<42-5,GATES>Why go through all this just to set you up?

915
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,510
<42-6,CASTLE>因为一死了之太便宜我了
<42-6,CASTLE>Because death only takes a moment.

916
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,660
<42-6,CASTLE>精心准备一出大案  是他的癖好
<42-6,CASTLE>The preparation and pageantry, that's what he loves.

917
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,040
<42-7,GATES>好吧  卡塞尔先生
<42-7,GATES>Well, Mr. Castle,

918
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,710
<42-7,GATES>看来你已经摆脱嫌疑了
<42-7,GATES>it looks like you're off the hook.

919
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,060
<42-7,GATES>我已经跟地方检察官说过了
<42-7,GATES>I've spoken to the D.A.,

920
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,270
<42-7,GATES>他们会撤销所有指控
<42-7,GATES>and they'll be dropping all charges.

921
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,600
<42-8,CASTLE>谢谢长官
<42-8,CASTLE>Thank you, sir.

922
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,850
<42-9,GATES>谋杀指控是没了
<42-9,GATES>For this, at least.

923
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,060
<42-9,GATES>但你逃脱监管这条罪名还在
<42-9,GATES>There's still the matter of your escape from custody.

924
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,400
<42-9,GATES>不过鉴于目前情况
<42-9,GATES>However, under the circumstances,

925
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,630
<42-9,GATES>我想你应该能讨个已服刑期
<42-9,GATES>I'm pretty sure you can negotiate down to time served.

926
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,110
<42-9,GATES>警探  你先把他带回警局
<42-9,GATES>Uh, detective, why don't you take him down to the station,

927
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,520
<42-9,GATES>把文件都填好
<42-9,GATES>start the paperwork?

928
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,090
<42-10,ESPOSITO>战术小组搜查了整栋楼
<42-10,ESPOSITO>So the tactical team searched the whole building.

929
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,210
<42-10,ESPOSITO>没找到他
<42-10,ESPOSITO>No sign of him.

930
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,760
<42-11,GATES>等鉴证组取完证据
<42-11,GATES>When C.S.U. finishes,

931
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,040
<42-11,GATES>把东西都归回原位  将这栋楼监视起来
<42-11,GATES>fall back and put the building under surveillance.

932
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,020
<42-12,CASTLE>如果他已经看到我们  不会回来了怎么办
<42-12,CASTLE>What if he's already seen us and he doesn't come back?

933
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,130
<42-13,GATES>整座城里的警察都在找他
<42-13,GATES>Every cop in this city is looking for him.

934
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,710
<42-13,GATES>他跑不了多远
<42-13,GATES>He won't get far.

935
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,910
<43-1,BECKETT>你没事吧
<43-1,BECKETT>You okay?

936
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,060
<43-1,BECKETT>嗯
<43-1,BECKETT>Yeah.

937
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,900
<43-2,CASTLE>能找到泰森的那些东西...
<43-2,CASTLE>Just finding that stuff of Tyson's...

938
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,900
<43-2,CASTLE>挺走运的
<43-2,CASTLE>It seems lucky.

939
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,000
<43-3,BECKETT>有时一点运气就足够逆转一切了
<43-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, sometimes luck is all you need.

940
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,710
<43-3,BECKETT>现在他躲不了了  我们会找到他的
<43-3,BECKETT>He can't hide now. We'll find him.

941
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,970
<43-4,CASTLE>谢谢你
<43-4,CASTLE>Thank you.

942
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,350
<43-5,BECKETT>谢什么
<43-5,BECKETT>For what?

943
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,670
<43-6,CASTLE>谢谢你相信我
<43-6,CASTLE>Believing in me.

944
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,660
<43-6,CASTLE>鉴于我的名声  还有我的过去...
<43-6,CASTLE>I mean, given my reputation, my history...

945
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,980
<43-6,CASTLE>你看到那些邮件后
<43-6,CASTLE>when you saw those e-mails,

946
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,310
<43-6,CASTLE>还会相信我  实在不容易
<43-6,CASTLE>it would've been real easy not to.

947
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,210
<43-7,BECKETT>咱俩之间的事时候什么时候容易过了
<43-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, things have never been easy between you and me.

948
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,680
<43-8,CASTLE>或许这就是我们值得
<43-8,CASTLE>Maybe that's what makes it all worth--

949
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,050
<43-9,BECKETT>是泰森  卡塞尔  趴下
<43-9,BECKETT>It's Tyson. Castle, get down!

950
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,390
<43-9,BECKETT>来啊  凯特  过来
<43-9,BECKETT>Come here, Kate. Come here.

951
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,730
<43-10,TYSON>卡塞尔
<43-10,TYSON>Castle!

952
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,650
<43-10,TYSON>你的女人在我手里
<43-10,TYSON>I got your girl!

953
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,530
<43-10,TYSON>看到了吗
<43-10,TYSON>Are you watching?

954
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,310
<43-11,TYSON>我要让你看着这一切
<43-11,TYSON>I want you to see this.

955
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,170
<43-11,TYSON>你以为我会这么容易就让你逃脱吗
<43-11,TYSON>You think that I'd let you live after everything you've done?

956
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,250
<43-11,TYSON>卡塞尔
<43-11,TYSON>Castle!

957
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,240
<43-11,TYSON>来啊  好好看着
<43-11,TYSON>Come on. I want you to watch.

958
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,970
<43-11,TYSON>我要让你亲眼看着我杀掉她
<43-11,TYSON>I want you to watch as I take her life.

959
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,200
<43-12,CASTLE>在这儿呢
<43-12,CASTLE>Over here.

960
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,740
<43-12,CASTLE>河水颜色太暗了  暂时还没发现目标
<43-12,CASTLE>The water's pretty murky. Haven't seen anything yet.

961
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,390
<44-1,BECKETT>他们还是没找到尸体
<44-1,BECKETT>They still haven't found the body.

962
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
<44-1,BECKETT>他们找不到的
<44-1,BECKETT>They won't.

963
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,260
<44-2,CASTLE>他没死
<44-2,CASTLE>He's not dead.

964
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,390
<44-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你说什么呢
<44-3,BECKETT>Castle, what are you saying?

965
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,210
<44-4,CASTLE>整件事根本就不是针对我
<44-4,CASTLE>This was never about me.

966
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,250
<44-4,CASTLE>是他为了自己而策划的
<44-4,CASTLE>This was about him.

967
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,740
<44-4,CASTLE>记得死者笔记本里的名字缩写吗
<44-4,CASTLE>Those initials in her date book?

968
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,510
<44-4,CASTLE>他不会那么粗心的
<44-4,CASTLE>He's not that careless.

969
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,170
<44-4,CASTLE>是他希望我们能找到那栋大楼
<44-4,CASTLE>He wanted us to find that place.

970
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,540
<44-4,CASTLE>然后让我们来这座桥
<44-4,CASTLE>He wanted us on this bridge.

971
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,200
<44-4,CASTLE>泰莎的谋杀案  还有陷害
<44-4,CASTLE>Tessa's murder, the frame up--

972
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,730
<44-4,CASTLE>所有这一切都是为了让我们来这
<44-4,CASTLE>all of it was to get us here so we could help him do

973
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,710
<44-4,CASTLE>帮他达到他自己无法完成的目的
<44-4,CASTLE>what he couldn't do for himself--

974
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,790
<44-4,CASTLE>彻底消失  以便日后再动手杀人
<44-4,CASTLE>disappear so he can start killing again.

975
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,420
<44-5,BECKETT>你觉得这些都是他计划好的
<44-5,BECKETT>You think he planned this?

976
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,120
<44-6,CASTLE>通缉犯怎样才能让自己不被继续通缉
<44-6,CASTLE>How does a wanted man stop being wanted?

977
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,460
<44-6,CASTLE>只有制造一起大案  让自己的死亡变得人尽皆知
<44-6,CASTLE>It has to be public and it has to be final.

978
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,920
<44-7,BECKETT>你知不知道这听起来多不靠谱
<44-7,BECKETT>Do you know how crazy that sounds?

979
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,140
<44-8,CASTLE>现在没有人会再通缉他了
<44-8,CASTLE>No one's gonna be looking for him anymore.

980
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,990
<44-9,BECKETT>你朝他开了枪
<44-9,BECKETT>You shot him.

981
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,750
<44-9,BECKETT>他死了  都结束了
<44-9,BECKETT>He's dead. It's over.

982
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,790
<44-10,CASTLE>暂时结束而已
<44-10,CASTLE>For now.
