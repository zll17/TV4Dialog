<3-15,CASTLE>And strikes fear into the heart of many a soon-to-be ex-husband.

102
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,980
<4-5,CASTLE>她做这个工作  树敌不少吧
<4-5,CASTLE>I'm sure in her line of work, she made a lot of enemies.

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,990
<4-5,CASTLE>有什么人来找她麻烦了吗
<4-5,CASTLE>Was there anyone in particular giving her trouble?

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
<4-7,BECKETT>逃离犯罪现场
<4-7,BECKETT>running away from the crime scene.

<5-7,RYAN>Until, of course, things got serious,

126
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,640
<5-7,RYAN>你就会甩掉她
<5-7,RYAN>which is when you'd dump her

127
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,600
<5-7,RYAN>再去找下一个梦中情人
<5-7,RYAN>and start looking for your next dream woman.

128
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,650
<5-7,RYAN>夫人  我们是纽约警局的
<5-7,RYAN>NYPD, ma'am.

<5-10,RYAN>Is there an R. Garrison here?

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,750
<5-12,RYAN>听见没  有老公了
<5-12,RYAN>Hear that? "Husband"...

135
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,500
<5-12,RYAN>-还是我们的嫌疑人  -好吧
<5-12,RYAN>- And suspect. - Yeah.

136
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,720
<6-1,ROB GARRISON>不  我们没见过
<6-1,ROB GARRISON>No, we've actually never met.

137
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,420
<6-2,RYAN>那你知道她身上怎么会有你的地址和名字吗
<6-2,RYAN>Do you have any idea why she had your name and address on her?

138
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,490
<6-3,ROB>我昨晚跟她通话的时候给她的
<6-3,ROB>Well, I gave it to her last night when I spoke with her.

139
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,510
<6-4,ROB>我是一个法务会计师  一般做破产案
<6-4,ROB>I'm a forensic accountant. It's mostly bankruptcies.

140
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,830
<6-4,ROB>但也经常为离婚律师做咨询
<6-4,ROB>But I do a lot of consulting for divorce attorneys.

141
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,160
<6-4,ROB>图伊小姐突然来找我
<6-4,ROB>So Ms. Twohey called me up, out of the blue,

142
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,390
<6-4,ROB>想要见面咨询一些财务问题
<6-4,ROB>and wanted to meet and go over some financial issues.

143
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,410
<6-5,ESPOSITO>谁的财务问题  她的吗
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Whose financial issues, her own?

144
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,530
<6-5,ESPOSITO>这她没说
<6-5,ESPOSITO>She didn't say.

145
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,040
<6-6,ROB>但我认得这个名字  也听说过她
<6-6,ROB>But I recognized her name and I knew her reputation,

146
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,060
<6-6,ROB>所以我猜应该是为了她的案子
<6-6,ROB>so I assumed it was about one of her clients.

147
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,750
<6-6,ROB>但是我们的谈话有点奇怪
<6-6,ROB>It was an odd conversation, though.

148
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,170
<6-7,RYAN>什么叫奇怪
<6-7,RYAN>Odd? How do you mean?

149
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,060
<6-8,ROB>她坚持一定要今天见面
<6-8,ROB>Well, she insisted on meeting today.

150
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,820
<6-8,ROB>所以不管是什么问题
<6-8,ROB>So whatever the issues were,

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,180
<6-8,ROB>图伊小姐都急着想解决
<6-8,ROB>Ms. Twohey was a bit frantic about getting them resolved quickly.

152
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,420
<7-1,BECKETT>如果那次见面是关于客户
<7-1,BECKETT>Hmm. Look, if that meeting was about a client,

153
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,980
<7-1,BECKETT>那我们就得查明是谁
<7-1,BECKETT>then we gotta find out which one.

154
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,260
<7-1,BECKETT>去她办公室
<7-1,BECKETT>So head down to her office

155
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,310
<7-1,BECKETT>看看她手里是什么案子
<7-1,BECKETT>and see what cases she was working on.

156
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,140
<7-1,BECKETT>既然米歇尔只有女性客户
<7-1,BECKETT>And you know what? Since Michelle only represented women,

157
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,150
<7-1,BECKETT>看看是否有与她对立的丈夫威胁过她
<7-1,BECKETT>see if any of the men she went up against threatened her.

158
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,090
<7-1,BECKETT>是啊  一到前妻的问题上
<7-1,BECKETT>Yeah, men are known to do stupid things

159
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,940
<7-1,BECKETT>男人就会做傻事
<7-1,BECKETT>when it comes to their ex-wives.

160
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,510
<7-2,BECKETT>好的
<7-2,BECKETT>Okay.

161
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,530
<7-2,BECKETT>谢谢
<7-2,BECKETT>Thank you.

162
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,690
<7-3,CASTLE>我来替你倒吧
<7-3,CASTLE>Hey. I'll get that for you.

163
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,050
<7-4,BECKETT>没事  我自己来
<7-4,BECKETT>That's okay. I got it.

164
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,220
<7-5,CASTLE>我只想告诉你
<7-5,CASTLE>So just to let you know,

165
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,070
<7-5,CASTLE>梅瑞狄斯的事我很抱歉
<7-5,CASTLE>I'm real sorry about that whole Meredith thing,

166
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,430
<7-5,CASTLE>但我会解决的
<7-5,CASTLE>But I am going to... take care of it.

168
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,100
<7-5,CASTLE>好的  我们就到
<7-5,CASTLE>Yeah. Okay. We'll be right there.

169
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,400
<7-6,BECKETT>蕾妮叫我们去
<7-6,BECKETT>Lanie's got something for us.

170
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,420
<7-7,CASTLE>你去吧  我去处理...
<7-7,CASTLE>You go deal with that. I'm gonna go deal with...

171
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,750
<7-7,CASTLE>那件事
<7-7,CASTLE>The other thing.

172
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,050
<7-7,CASTLE>我搞得定
<7-7,CASTLE>Take care of it.

173
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,260
<8-1,LANIE>不  该由你去搞定
<8-1,LANIE>No. You've gotta take care of it.

174
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,030
<8-1,LANIE>这可是梅瑞狄斯啊
<8-1,LANIE>This is Meredith we're talking about--

175
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,380
<8-1,LANIE>每次来纽约卡塞尔都会跟她滚床单的
<8-1,LANIE>The deep-fried twinkie that Castle has ex-sex with

176
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,850
<8-1,LANIE>油炸奶糕[外号出自第一季]
<8-1,LANIE>whenever she rolls into town.

177
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,800
<8-1,LANIE>蕾妮
<8-1,LANIE>Lanie.

178
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,100
<8-2,BECKETT>我信任他
<8-2,BECKETT>Look, I trust him.

179
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,910
<8-2,BECKETT>他不会跟她滚床单的
<8-2,BECKETT>He's not gonna have sex with her.

180
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,000
<8-2,BECKETT>好吧
<8-2,BECKETT>Fine.

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,110
<8-3,LANIE>就算跟滚床单无关
<8-3,LANIE>Let's say it isn't about sex.

182
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,430
<8-3,LANIE>这是个界限问题
<8-3,LANIE>It's about boundaries.

183
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,090
<8-3,LANIE>梅瑞狄斯这是在标记领地呢
<8-3,LANIE>Meredith is marking her territory.

184
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,450
<8-3,LANIE>你不能让她随心所欲的来去
<8-3,LANIE>You can't just let her waltz in and out whenever she pleases.

185
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,010
<8-4,BECKETT>他没办法  阿丽克西斯病了
<8-4,BECKETT>He's in a catch-22. Alexis is sick--

186
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,000
<8-5,LANIE>那又怎么样
<8-5,LANIE>Doesn't matter.

187
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
<8-5,LANIE>这可是战争  你说现在是谁在节节败退
<8-5,LANIE>This is a war, girl, and guess who's losing.

188
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,310
<8-6,BECKETT>我不知道
<8-6,BECKETT>I don't know.

189
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,550
<8-7,LANIE>或许你是对的
<8-7,LANIE>Maybe you're right.

190
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,590
<8-7,LANIE>什么叫或许  我必须是对的
<8-7,LANIE>Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.

191
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,810
<8-8,BECKETT>蕾妮  我过来不是为了探讨这个
<8-8,BECKETT>Lanie, I didn't come down here to talk about this.

192
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,710
<8-8,BECKETT>你说你找到了跟案子有关的东西
<8-8,BECKETT>You said that you have something case related.

193
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,090
<8-9,LANIE>是的  想听点好消息吗
<8-9,LANIE>Yes. Are you ready for some good news now?

194
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,390
<8-10,BECKETT>那好啊
<8-10,BECKETT>That would be nice.

195
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,470
<8-11,LANIE>我分析了被害人的衣物
<8-11,LANIE>I processed the victim's clothing

196
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,040
<8-11,LANIE>找到了另一人的血迹
<8-11,LANIE>and found trace amounts of someone else's blood

197
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,650
<8-11,LANIE>就在她的夹克扣子上
<8-11,LANIE>on her jacket button.

198
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,290
<8-12,BECKETT>那么凶手可能在行凶时把自己割伤了
<8-12,BECKETT>Which means our killer could've gotten cut during the attack.

199
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,610
<8-13,LANIE>这会儿在查DNA呢
<8-13,LANIE>I'm running D.N.A. now.

200
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,320
<8-13,LANIE>有发现会告诉你
<8-13,LANIE>I'll call you when I got something.

201
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,710
<8-14,BECKETT>谢谢
<8-14,BECKETT>Thank you.

202
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,650
<9-1,RYAN>米歇尔律所的所有员工
<9-1,RYAN>So each one of Michelle's employees at her law firm

203
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,880
<9-1,RYAN>都有不在场证据
<9-1,RYAN>alibied out.

204
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,450
<9-1,RYAN>但他们都说她过去几周举止奇怪
<9-1,RYAN>But they all said she'd been acting odd during the past few weeks.

205
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,090
<9-1,RYAN>他们觉得是因为一件案子
<9-1,RYAN>They assumed it had to do with a case.

206
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,150
<9-2,BECKETT>什么案子
<9-2,BECKETT>Which case?

207
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,080
<9-3,RYAN>选一个吧
<9-3,RYAN>Pick one.

208
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,450
<9-3,RYAN>为你介绍曼哈顿的富豪们
<9-3,RYAN>Introducing the wealthy men of Manhattan.

209
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,940
<9-3,RYAN>在离婚案中  米歇尔是
<9-3,RYAN>Michelle represented all their wives

210
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,180
<9-3,RYAN>他们妻子的律师
<9-3,RYAN>in ongoing divorces,

211
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,510
<9-3,RYAN>有一些愤怒的丈夫威胁过她
<9-3,RYAN>And some of these angry husbands had threatened her.

212
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,960
<9-3,RYAN>唯一的问题是  他们的外貌都和素描不符
<9-3,RYAN>The only problem is, none of 'em matched our sketch.

213
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,320
<9-4,BECKETT>也许是因为某人
<9-4,BECKETT>Maybe that's because one of them

214
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,650
<9-4,BECKETT>雇佣了这位神秘男来谋杀米歇尔
<9-4,BECKETT>hired our mystery man to kill Michelle.

215
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,530
<9-5,RYAN>但必须找到神秘男才能知道到底是谁雇了他
<9-5,RYAN>But we won't know which one until we find this guy.

216
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,680
<9-6,ESPOSITO>我找到了
<9-6,ESPOSITO>And I just did.

217
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,020
<9-6,ESPOSITO>在地铁的监控录像里
<9-6,ESPOSITO>On the subway security video,

218
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,340
<9-6,ESPOSITO>我看见嫌疑犯刷地铁卡
<9-6,ESPOSITO>I saw our suspect swipe his M.T.A. Card.

219
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,060
<9-6,ESPOSITO>他是用信用卡买的
<9-6,ESPOSITO>He used a credit card to buy it.

220
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,390
<10-1,ESPOSITO>赫曼·波及尤
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Herman Poquille.

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,370
<10-1,ESPOSITO>哎呦  还有几次试图谋杀呢
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Oh, and several attempted murders.

223
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,660
<10-2,RYAN>恭喜  你终于成功了
<10-2,RYAN>Congratulations. You finally succeeded.

224
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,970
<10-3,ESPOSITO>问题是  我们弄不明白
<10-3,ESPOSITO>Only thing is, we can't figure out

225
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,760
<10-3,ESPOSITO>你为什么要杀图伊女士
<10-3,ESPOSITO>why you'd want to kill Ms. Twohey.

226
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,790
<10-4,RYAN>没偷钱包
<10-4,RYAN>Purse wasn't stolen.

227
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,750
<10-4,RYAN>没开走汽车  你为什么要杀害她
<10-4,RYAN>The car wasn't jacked. So why'd you want to kill her?

228
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,480
<10-5,HERMAN POQUILLE>我没杀她  事情不是你们想的那样
<10-5,HERMAN POQUILLE>I didn't kill her. It's not what you think.

229
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,770
<10-5,HERMAN POQUILLE>得了吧  赫曼
<10-5,HERMAN POQUILLE>Come on, Herman.

230
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,920
<10-6,ESPOSITO>你可以坦白一切  有人雇了你
<10-6,ESPOSITO>You can talk to us. Someone hired you.

231
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,250
<10-7,POQUILLE>对啊  她雇的
<10-7,POQUILLE>Yeah, she did.

232
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,720
<10-7,POQUILLE>我说了  事情不是你们想的那样
<10-7,POQUILLE>Like I said. It's not what you think.

233
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,320
<10-7,POQUILLE>我以前为米歇尔工作
<10-7,POQUILLE>I used to work for Michelle.

234
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,340
<10-8,RYAN>做什么
<10-8,RYAN>Doing what?

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,580
<10-9,POQUILLE>拍照
<10-9,POQUILLE>Photographer.

236
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,980
<10-9,POQUILLE>拍下丈夫偷情之类的照片
<10-9,POQUILLE>Shots of husbands cheating on their wives, stuff like that.

237
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,230
<10-10,RYAN>这还是无法解释
<10-10,RYAN>That still doesn't explain

238
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,870
<10-10,RYAN>你当时在犯罪现场做什么
<10-10,RYAN>what you were doing at the crime scene.

239
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,790
<10-10,RYAN>听着
<10-10,RYAN>Look,

240
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,530
<10-11,POQUILLE>不久前我搞砸了一次任务
<10-11,POQUILLE>I botched an assignment a while ago,

241
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,670
<10-11,POQUILLE>于是米歇尔炒了我
<10-11,POQUILLE>and Michelle fired me.

242
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,960
<10-11,POQUILLE>突然  她又给我打电话
<10-11,POQUILLE>Then all of a sudden, she's calling me,

243
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,540
<10-11,POQUILLE>让我帮她接个大活儿
<10-11,POQUILLE>asking me for my help on some big job.

244
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,590
<10-12,ESPOSITO>什么大活儿
<10-12,ESPOSITO>What big job?

245
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,920
<10-13,POQUILLE>她没说
<10-13,POQUILLE>She didn't say.

246
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,240
<10-13,POQUILLE>她说她在回家的路上
<10-13,POQUILLE>She said she was heading home

247
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,750
<10-13,POQUILLE>会在地铁站旁边等我
<10-13,POQUILLE>and would wait for me near the subway.

248
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,470
<10-13,POQUILLE>我到的时候  她已经死了
<10-13,POQUILLE>By the time I got there, she was dead.

249
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,640
<10-13,POQUILLE>我不想和谋杀案扯上关系  所以就逃跑了
<10-13,POQUILLE>I didn't want to get mixed up in a murder, so I ran.

250
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,650
<10-14,ESPOSITO>-你们不信我吗  -不信
<10-14,ESPOSITO>- You don't believe me? - Mnh-mnh.

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
<10-15,POQUILLE>去看我手机上的短信吧
<10-15,POQUILLE>Check the texts on my phone.

252
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,700
<10-15,POQUILLE>都有呢
<10-15,POQUILLE>It's all there.

253
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,340
<11-1,RYAN>我查看了赫曼的手机
<11-1,RYAN>So I went through Herman's phone,

254
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,790
<11-1,RYAN>他没撒谎
<11-1,RYAN>and he wasn't lying.

255
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,120
<11-1,RYAN>米歇尔想雇他拍照片
<11-1,RYAN>Michelle wanted to hire him to take photos,

256
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,770
<11-1,RYAN>看上去她很绝望
<11-1,RYAN>and she seemed pretty desperate.

257
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,380
<11-1,RYAN>赫曼不想接这份活
<11-1,RYAN>Herman didn't want to take the job,

258
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,090
<11-1,RYAN>一直回复她"不行"
<11-1,RYAN>and he kept texting her "No."

259
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,800
<11-1,RYAN>但她最后总算靠视频说服了他
<11-1,RYAN>But she seemed to finally win him over with this.

260
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,320
<11-2,MICHELLE>赫曼
<11-2,MICHELLE>Okay, Herman.

261
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,230
<11-2,MICHELLE>我的短信没有让你改变主意
<11-2,MICHELLE>My texts aren't changing your mind,

262
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,640
<11-2,MICHELLE>也许这段视频能
<11-2,MICHELLE>so maybe this will.

263
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,700
<11-2,MICHELLE>看着我  我在求你
<11-2,MICHELLE>Look at me. I'm pleading.

264
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,380
<11-2,MICHELLE>我遇上了大麻烦  需要你
<11-2,MICHELLE>I have a huge problem, and I need you

265
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,420
<11-2,MICHELLE>和你的照相机帮我最后一个忙
<11-2,MICHELLE>and that camera of yours for one last job.

266
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,450
<11-2,MICHELLE>求你了
<11-2,MICHELLE>Please.

267
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,850
<11-3,ESPOSITO>性命攸关
<11-3,ESPOSITO>A life hangs in the balance.

268
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,380
<11-3,ESPOSITO>性命攸关
<11-3,ESPOSITO>"A life hangs in the balance"?

269
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,410
<11-3,ESPOSITO>她到底要拍谁的照片
<11-3,ESPOSITO>What the hell did she need a photo of?

279
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,520
<12-1,MEREDITH>好啊
<12-1,MEREDITH>Hi there.

280
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
<12-1,MEREDITH>抓到凶手了吗
<12-1,MEREDITH>Did you catch the killer already?

281
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,000
<12-2,CASTLE>还没有  阿丽克西斯怎么样了
<12-2,CASTLE>Uh, no. Not yet. How's Alexis?

282
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,300
<12-3,MEREDITH>她还在睡觉  但我要端着热汤去叫醒她
<12-3,MEREDITH>Mm, sleeping, but I'm gonna wake her with some soup.

283
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,040
<12-3,MEREDITH>你要吗
<12-3,MEREDITH>Want some?

284

<12-4,CASTLE>不用了  谢谢
<12-4,CASTLE>Oh. Um, no, thanks.

285
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,850
<12-4,CASTLE>梅瑞狄斯
<12-4,CASTLE>Listen, Meredith,

286
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,000
<12-4,CASTLE>关于你住这里的事
<12-4,CASTLE>about you staying here--

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
<12-5,MEREDITH>再次感谢  理查德
<12-5,MEREDITH>Thanks again, Richard.

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,690
<12-5,MEREDITH>这对我来说真是意义重大
<12-5,MEREDITH>I can't tell you how much this means to me.

289
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,370
<12-5,MEREDITH>好吧
<12-5,MEREDITH>Yeah.

290
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,550
<12-6,CASTLE>-只是  贝克特和我  -都是好人
<12-6,CASTLE>- It's just... Beckett and I... - Are wonderful.

291
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,830
<12-7,MEREDITH>看到你们俩的
<12-7,MEREDITH>It's so refreshing to see

292
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,490
<12-7,MEREDITH>关系如此稳定  我真是太开心了
<12-7,MEREDITH>how secure you two are in your relationship.

293
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,840
<12-7,MEREDITH>大部分女人都会不满
<12-7,MEREDITH>You know, most women would take issue with an ex-wife

294
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,230
<12-7,MEREDITH>男朋友和前女友住一起
<12-7,MEREDITH>staying with their boyfriend.

295
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,890
<12-7,MEREDITH>但凯特·贝克特不一样  她通情达理
<12-7,MEREDITH>But not Kate Beckett. She gets it.

296
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,520
<12-8,CASTLE>是啊  凯特通情达理
<12-8,CASTLE>Yeah. Kate gets it.

297
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,110
<12-8,CASTLE>问题是  梅瑞狄斯  我...
<12-8,CASTLE>Um, here's the thing, Meredith, I...

298
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,790
<12-8,CASTLE>我懂
<12-8,CASTLE>I know.

299
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,200
<12-9,MEREDITH>而且...
<12-9,MEREDITH>And...

300
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,430
<12-9,MEREDITH>要我承认这点很不容易
<12-9,MEREDITH>It isn't easy for me to admit...

301
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,300
<12-9,MEREDITH>但我并不是个好妈妈
<12-9,MEREDITH>I haven't been the best of mothers.

302
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,650
<12-9,MEREDITH>我错过了我们女儿的太多生活
<12-9,MEREDITH>I've missed so much of our daughter's life.

303
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,850
<12-9,MEREDITH>你现在让我住在这里
<12-9,MEREDITH>So the fact that you're letting me be here now

304
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,500
<12-9,MEREDITH>照顾生病的阿丽克西斯
<12-9,MEREDITH>for Alexis during her time of need,

305
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,780
<12-9,MEREDITH>理查德  我永远不会忘记的
<12-9,MEREDITH>Richard, I'll never, ever forget this.

306
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,810
<12-10,CASTLE>贝克特也忘不了
<12-10,CASTLE>Neither will Beckett.

307
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,360
<13-1,BECKETT>怎么样
<13-1,BECKETT>Well?

308
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,220
<13-2,CASTLE>什么怎么样
<13-2,CASTLE>Well, what?

309
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,140
<13-2,CASTLE>那事啊
<13-2,CASTLE>Oh, that.

310
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,380
<13-2,CASTLE>我还在处理
<13-2,CASTLE>Still working on that.

311
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,810
<13-2,CASTLE>寻找杀害米歇尔·图伊的凶手
<13-2,CASTLE>What about, uh, any progress

312
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,480
<13-2,CASTLE>有什么进展吗
<13-2,CASTLE>on finding Michelle Twohey's killer?

313
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,590
<13-2,CASTLE>还没有
<13-2,CASTLE>No, not yet.

314
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,660
<13-3,BECKETT>我们还在核对前夫们的不在场证明
<13-3,BECKETT>We're still checking on the ex-husbands' alibis.

315
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,950
<13-4,RYAN>各位
<13-4,RYAN>Hey, guys.

316
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,850
<13-4,RYAN>我觉得我们该换个思路
<13-4,RYAN>Uh... I think we might have our theory backwards.

317
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,390
<13-4,RYAN>如果杀害图伊女士的
<13-4,RYAN>What if it wasn't an angry ex-husband

318
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,330
<13-4,RYAN>不是愤怒的丈夫呢
<13-4,RYAN>that killed Ms. Twohey?

319
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,610
<13-4,RYAN>也可能是前妻干的
<13-4,RYAN>What if it was an ex-wife?

320
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,440
<13-5,BECKETT>麻烦的前妻
<13-5,BECKETT>Oh, wow. A troublesome ex-wife?

321
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,970
<13-5,BECKETT>想象一下吧
<13-5,BECKETT>Imagine that.

322
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,220
<13-5,BECKETT>你觉得是她的客户杀了她
<13-5,BECKETT>So you think one of her clients killed her?

323
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,130
<13-6,RYAN>蕾妮查到了
<13-6,RYAN>Uh, well, Lanie got a hit

324
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,670
<13-6,RYAN>米歇尔外套上的血迹
<13-6,RYAN>on the blood found on Michelle's jacket.

325
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,940
<13-6,RYAN>是萨曼莎·沃斯的
<13-6,RYAN>It belongs to a Samantha Voss.

326
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,860
<13-6,RYAN>她在犯罪系统里有在洛杉矶酒驾的记录
<13-6,RYAN>She's in the system due to a D.U.I. Arrest in Los Angeles.

327
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,310
<13-7,BECKETT>她对米歇尔不满吗
<13-7,BECKETT>Did she have a grievance with Michelle?

328
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,450
<13-8,RYAN>我觉得是  米歇尔被谋杀的那天早上
<13-8,RYAN>Oh, I'd say so. The morning of Michelle's murder,

329
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,480
<13-8,RYAN>一名法官宣判了萨曼莎
<13-8,RYAN>a judge came down with a ruling

330
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,180
<13-8,RYAN>备受争议的离婚案的裁决
<13-8,RYAN>in Samantha's contentious divorce case.

331
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,900
<13-8,RYAN>她的损失可大了
<13-8,RYAN>She lost big.

332
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,930
<13-9,CASTLE>有多大
<13-9,CASTLE>How big is big?

333
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,460
<13-10,RYAN>她失掉了上东区的公寓
<13-10,RYAN>Uh, upper east side apartment big.

334
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,830
<13-10,RYAN>豪车  游艇
<13-10,RYAN>Cars and boats big.

335
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,030
<13-10,RYAN>还有百万资产的一半
<13-10,RYAN>Half of her multimillion-dollar net worth big.

336
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,780
<13-11,CASTLE>确实很大啊
<13-11,CASTLE>That's big.

337
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,940
<13-12,RYAN>而且判决结束后  萨曼莎愤然离场
<13-12,RYAN>Especially when Samantha went off on a courtroom tirade,

338
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,100
<13-12,RYAN>指责米歇尔搞砸了她的案子
<13-12,RYAN>accusing Michelle of screwing up her case.

339
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,300
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>她身上当然有我的血
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>Of course my blood was on her.

340
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,410
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>她把我的离婚案搞得一团糟
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>Michelle completely mishandled my divorce.

341
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,850
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>我气疯了  我们动起手来
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>I was furious. Our spat became physical,

342
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,630
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>她外套上的金属扣子割到了我的手
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>And I cut my hand on one of her metal jacket buttons.

343
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,400
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>但我可没杀她
<14-1,SAMANTHA PETERMAN>But I didn't kill her.

344
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,670
<14-2,BECKETT>-沃斯太太  -沃斯太太已经死了
<14-2,BECKETT>- Mrs. Voss... - Mrs. Voss is dead.

345
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,790
<14-3,SAMANTHA>我单身了  是彼得曼小姐  谢谢
<14-3,SAMANTHA>I'm back to Ms. Peterman now, thank you.

346
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,150
<14-3,SAMANTHA>别  别  别
<14-3,SAMANTHA>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

347
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,600
<14-3,SAMANTHA>瓷器不用打包
<14-3,SAMANTHA>Don't pack the china.

348
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,750
<14-3,SAMANTHA>它们跟了我前夫
<14-3,SAMANTHA>That stays with my ex now.

349
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,150
<14-3,SAMANTHA>那个混蛋
<14-3,SAMANTHA>The jackhole.

350
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,940
<14-4,BECKETT>彼得曼小姐  昨晚十点到凌晨一点
<14-4,BECKETT>Ms. Peterman, where were you last night

351
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,320
<14-4,BECKETT>你人在哪里
<14-4,BECKETT>between 10:00 and 1:00?

352
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,290
<14-5,SAMANTHA>我在参加一个慈善拍卖会
<14-5,SAMANTHA>I was at a charity auction,

353
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,650
<14-5,SAMANTHA>是由我主持的
<14-5,SAMANTHA>which I chair,

354
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,490
<14-5,SAMANTHA>直到两点才结束
<14-5,SAMANTHA>until 2:00 a.m.

355
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,460
<14-6,SAMANTHA>有一百多人能为我作证呢
<14-6,SAMANTHA>There are over a hundred donors who can vouch for that.

356
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,500
<14-6,SAMANTHA>想查就查吧
<14-6,SAMANTHA>Just check it out if you'd like.

357
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,500
<14-7,CASTLE>你可能没杀米歇尔
<14-7,CASTLE>Well, you may not have killed Michelle,

358
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,880
<14-7,CASTLE>但你确实毁了一幅珍贵的油画
<14-7,CASTLE>but you certainly murdered that original Zaozirny.

359
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,560
<14-8,SAMANTHA>我可用不着靠杀人来报仇
<14-8,SAMANTHA>I don't have to kill to get revenge.

360
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,980
<14-8,SAMANTHA>报复我前夫的方法多了去了
<14-8,SAMANTHA>Not when there's so many other ways to get back at my ex.

361
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,150
<14-8,SAMANTHA>悲哀啊
<14-8,SAMANTHA>Shame.

362
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,250
<14-8,SAMANTHA>那盘子可是搭配这些的关键

368
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,190
<14-10,SAMANTHA>过去的一个月里
<14-10,SAMANTHA>because for the past month,

<14-10,SAMANTHA>她总是心神不宁

<14-12,SAMANTHA>根本找不到好法子来解决呗
<14-12,SAMANTHA>that had absolutely no bearing on securing a better settlement,

373
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,970
<14-12,SAMANTHA>更别提她的私人问题了
<14-12,SAMANTHA>and don't even get me started on her personal problems.

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,290
<14-13,BECKETT>什么私人问题
<14-13,BECKETT>What do you mean, her personal problems?

<15-6,BECKETT>和平过头了吧

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,020
<15-7,CASTLE>米歇尔·图伊有心事

<15-8,BECKETT>出庭之前  她去咖啡馆吃了早餐

407
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,930
<15-8,BECKETT>说不定那里的人会有线索
<15-8,BECKETT>so maybe someone there will let us know what was so upsetting.

<15-15,CASTLE>她说她想住我家
<15-15,CASTLE>and she said she wanted to stay in the loft.

421
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,010
<15-16,ESPOSITO>然后你拒绝了

<15-20,ESPOSITO>你这简直是火上浇油啊
<15-20,ESPOSITO>That's like throwing gasoline on fireworks.

<15-21,CASTLE>我说伙计们  没那么糟糕吧
<15-21,CASTLE>Come on. Guys, it... it's not that bad.

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,240
<15-24,BECKETT>咖啡馆老板记得米歇尔
<15-24,BECKETT>So the cafe owner remembers Michelle having an argument

431
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,550
<15-24,BECKETT>当时在跟一位高大帅气  30多岁  浅棕发色
<15-24,BECKETT>with a tall, good-looking man, mid-30s, light brown hair,

432
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,850
<15-24,BECKETT>蓝眼睛的男人争吵

<15-25,CASTLE>是她的男朋友科瑞·弗兰西斯吗
<15-25,CASTLE>Her boyfriend Corey Francis?

434
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,120
<15-25,CASTLE>他不是说周末后就没见过米歇尔吗
<15-25,CASTLE>I thought he said he hadn't seen Michelle since the weekend.

435
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,750
<15-25,CASTLE>他为什么要说谎
<15-25,CASTLE>Now why would he lie?

436
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,180
<15-26,ESPOSITO>他在隐瞒什么
<15-26,ESPOSITO>Looks like he's hiding something.

437
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,380
<15-27,BECKETT>把他找来问问看
<15-27,BECKETT>Let's bring him down here and find out what?

442
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,620
<16-2,BECKETT>米歇尔跟男朋友吵了一架
<16-2,BECKETT>Michelle fights with her boyfriend,

443
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,830
<16-2,BECKETT>然后跟一位会计约好了见面

444
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,320
<16-2,BECKETT>还雇了一个摄影师
<16-2,BECKETT>and then she hires a photographer.

445
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,140
<16-2,BECKETT>她到底遇上什么事了
<16-2,BECKETT>What the hell was she into?

446
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,470
<16-2,BECKETT>不知道
<16-2,BECKETT>I don't know.

447
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,250
<16-3,CASTLE>不如我们今晚在四季酒店的超大按摩浴缸里
<16-3,CASTLE>But why don't we discuss it tonight in our

448

450
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,460
<16-4,BECKETT>为什么
<16-4,BECKETT>Why would you do that?

451
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,710
<16-5,CASTLE>因为你家还在烟熏消毒
<16-5,CASTLE>Because your place is still being fumigated,

452
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,850
<16-5,CASTLE>我家又人满为患
<16-5,CASTLE>and my loft is overrun with redheads.

453
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,530
<16-5,CASTLE>我就想  我们何不去享受一番呢
<16-5,CASTLE>So I thought, why not just go and enjoy ourselves?

458
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,580
<16-8,RYAN>地址是假的  连名字也是捏造的

<16-16,BECKETT>You know, we can I.D. him using the yearbooks.

474
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,690
<16-16,BECKETT>他三十多岁  我们不如彻查
<16-16,BECKETT>He's in mid-30s, so why don't we grab

475
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,450
<16-16,BECKETT>1996年那几年所有大学图书馆的资料吧
<16-16,BECKETT>everything from the university library from '96 and on?

476
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,040
<16-17,RYAN>那地方可有点偏僻
<16-17,RYAN>Oh, well, that's, uh, upstate.

477
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,970
<16-18,ESPOSITO>-我们明早去查  -对
<16-18,ESPOSITO>- We'll have it for you in the morning. - Yeah.

478
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,180
<16-20,BECKETT>不行
<16-20,BECKETT>No.

479
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,330
<16-21,CASTLE>什么不行
<16-21,CASTLE>No what?

480
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,460
<16-22,BECKETT>不去四季酒店
<16-22,BECKETT>No on the Four Seasons.

481
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,190
<16-22,BECKETT>如果有人要去宾馆  那也该是梅瑞狄斯
<16-22,BECKETT>If anyone should be sent to a hotel, it's Meredith.

482
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,570
<16-23,CASTLE>我试过了  只是...
<16-23,CASTLE>Well, I tried. It just--

483
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,500
<16-23,CASTLE>让她陪着阿丽克西斯对她来说意义重大
<16-23,CASTLE>It means so much to her to be there for Alexis,

484
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,840
<16-23,CASTLE>要是把她赶去宾馆住
<16-23,CASTLE>and, ah, it just seemed heartless

485
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,900
<16-23,CASTLE>就太冷血无情了
<16-23,CASTLE>to kick her out and send her to a hotel.

486
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,560
<16-24,BECKETT>是吗  卡塞尔  你刚才还想打发我去宾馆呢
<16-24,BECKETT>Really, Castle? 'cause you just tried sending me to one.

487
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,540
<16-25,CASTLE>不  那是因为
<16-25,CASTLE>No, but that was because...

488
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,640
<16-26,BECKETT>没有因为了
<16-26,BECKETT>But nothing.

489
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,600
<16-26,BECKETT>住嘴  猫咪  我们回家
<16-26,BECKETT>Button up, kitten. We're going home.

490
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,940
<17-1,MEREDITH>真香啊  我能喝一杯吗
<17-1,MEREDITH>That smells delicious. Can I have a cup?

491
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,650
<17-2,BECKETT>我是给卡塞尔煮的
<17-2,BECKETT>I... was just making that for Castle.

492
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,010
<17-2,BECKETT>不过  好吧  给
<17-2,BECKETT>But, yeah, here.

493
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,200
<17-3,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯怎么样
<17-3,BECKETT>So how is Alexis?

494
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,540
<17-4,MEREDITH>她在睡觉  她总是在睡觉
<17-4,MEREDITH>She's asleep. She's always asleep.

495
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,820
<17-4,MEREDITH>我爱她  不过说实话
<17-4,MEREDITH>I love her, but with mono,

496
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,430
<17-4,MEREDITH>她这人其实挺无聊的
<17-4,MEREDITH>she's a bit of a bore.

497
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,140
<17-6,MEREDITH>你和里奇怎么样
<17-6,MEREDITH>So you and Rick...

<17-7,BECKETT>So...

500
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,790
<17-7,BECKETT>话说
<17-7,BECKETT>You know, uh,

501
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,750
<17-7,BECKETT>你还是把裤子穿上吧
<17-7,BECKETT>you might want to put some pants on.

502
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,210
<17-8,MEREDITH>为什么  我又不出去
<17-8,MEREDITH>Why? It's not like I'm going anywhere.

503
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,260
<17-9,CASTLE>你们早啊
<17-9,CASTLE>Hey, you two.

504
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,900
<17-9,CASTLE>怎么了
<17-9,CASTLE>What's going on?

505
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,650
<17-10,MEREDITH>没什么  只是在煮咖啡
<17-10,MEREDITH>Nothing. Just making coffee.

506
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,250
<17-10,MEREDITH>给  这杯给你
<17-10,MEREDITH>Here. This is for you.

<17-11,CASTLE>谢谢
<17-11,CASTLE>Oh, thank you.

508
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,830
<17-11,CASTLE>里面是什么  你是不是加了...
<17-11,CASTLE>What is in this? Did you add...

509
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,640
<17-12,MEREDITH>-肉豆蔻  -肉豆蔻
<17-12,MEREDITH>- Nutmeg? - Nutmeg.

510
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,340
<17-12,MEREDITH>肉豆蔻
<17-12,MEREDITH>Nutmeg?

511
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,620
<17-14,MEREDITH>里奇每次熬夜
<17-14,MEREDITH>Whenever Rick pulled all-nighters,

512
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,730
<17-14,MEREDITH>我都会给他在咖啡里洒肉豆蔻
<17-14,MEREDITH>I'd sprinkle nutmeg in his coffee.

513
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,380
<17-14,MEREDITH>后劲更足  你想试试吗
<17-14,MEREDITH>Gave it an extra kick. You want to try?

514
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,440
<17-15,BECKETT>不  谢了
<17-15,BECKETT>Uh, no, thanks.

515
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,100
<17-15,BECKETT>我觉得今天早上后劲已经够足了
<17-15,BECKETT>I think I've had enough kick for one morning.

516
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,530
<17-15,BECKETT>我去上班了
<17-15,BECKETT>I will be at work.

517
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,100
<18-1,CASTLE>听着
<18-1,CASTLE>Listen, um...

518
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,040
<18-1,CASTLE>咖啡的事
<18-1,CASTLE>That whole coffee thing,

519
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,590
<18-1,CASTLE>梅瑞狄斯没有恶意
<18-1,CASTLE>Meredith didn't mean anything by that.

520
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,020
<18-1,CASTLE>她只是想更周到些
<18-1,CASTLE>She's just trying to be thoughtful.

521
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,860
<18-2,BECKETT>那是当然
<18-2,BECKETT>I'm sure she was.

522
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,340
<18-3,CASTLE>你没生气
<18-3,CASTLE>So you're not mad?

523
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,260
<18-4,BECKETT>生什么气
<18-4,BECKETT>About what?

524
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,420
<18-4,BECKETT>气你前妻在你家和你家人相处
<18-4,BECKETT>About how comfortable your ex-wife is in your home

525
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,390
<18-4,BECKETT>有多和睦吗
<18-4,BECKETT>and with your family,

526
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,550
<18-4,BECKETT>气她对你的事了如指掌  而我却一无所知吗
<18-4,BECKETT>how she seems to know things about you that I don't know?

527
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,640
<18-4,BECKETT>我有什么好气的
<18-4,BECKETT>Why would I be upset?

528
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,380
<18-5,CASTLE>你看  这就是我想住在四季酒店的原因
<18-5,CASTLE>Okay, see, this is why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons,

529
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,600
<18-5,CASTLE>这样你就不用面对这些事了
<18-5,CASTLE>So you wouldn't have to deal with this.

530
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,180
<18-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我本来就不该面对这些事
<18-6,BECKETT>Castle, I shouldn't have to deal with this

531
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,760
<18-6,BECKETT>因为你本该拒绝她的
<18-6,BECKETT>because you should've said no.

532
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,470
<18-7,CASTLE>是  可我没有  现在我又骑虎难下
<18-7,CASTLE>Yes, but I didn't, and now I can't.

533
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,180
<18-7,CASTLE>我知道了  我会...
<18-7,CASTLE>I know. I'll...

534
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
<18-7,CASTLE>我会让阿丽克西斯和梅瑞狄斯去四季酒店
<18-7,CASTLE>I'll send Alexis and Meredith to the Four Seasons.

535
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,690
<18-7,CASTLE>只要雇个值班医生就行了
<18-7,CASTLE>I'll just hire a concierge doctor.

536
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,510
<18-8,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  我不是小孩子  好吗
<18-8,BECKETT>No. Castle, I am a big girl, okay?

537
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,330
<18-8,BECKETT>我能体谅你前妻的心情
<18-8,BECKETT>I can be in the same place as your ex-wife.

538
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,200
<18-9,CASTLE>那你不走吗
<18-9,CASTLE>So you'll stay?

539
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,700
<18-10,BECKETT>对  当然
<18-10,BECKETT>Yeah. Sure.

540
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,030
<18-10,BECKETT>我会忍受她半裸着走来走去
<18-10,BECKETT>I'll just be subjected to her parading around half naked.

541
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,710
<18-11,CASTLE>我怎么说都没用了  是吧
<18-11,CASTLE>Oh. Okay. I can't win, can I?

542
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,500
<18-12,BECKETT>对  都是你的错
<18-12,BECKETT>Oh, right. Because this is all about you.

543
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,840
<18-13,CASTLE>你让这事...
<18-13,CASTLE>Well, you made it...

544
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,500
<18-13,CASTLE>如果我...
<18-13,CASTLE>If I...

545
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,110
<18-13,CASTLE>好吧  知道吗  你说得对
<18-13,CASTLE>Okay, you know what? You're right.

546
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,720
<18-13,CASTLE>你说得太对了
<18-13,CASTLE>You are absolutely right.

547
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,950
<18-13,CASTLE>我们只需要再忍几天和我疯狂的前妻
<18-13,CASTLE>All we have to do is get through the next few days

548
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,910
<18-13,CASTLE>共处的日子
<18-13,CASTLE>with my crazy ex-wife.

550
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,480
<18-13,CASTLE>好吗
<18-13,CASTLE>What do you say?

551
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
<18-14,BECKETT>诺亚[发音近似"不"]
<18-14,BECKETT>Noah.

552
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,820
<18-15,CASTLE>不
<18-15,CASTLE>No?

553
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,120
<18-16,BECKETT>不是"不"  是诺亚·加斯伍德
<18-16,BECKETT>No, not "No." Noah Kesswood.

554
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,230
<18-16,BECKETT>科瑞·弗兰西斯实际上是...
<18-16,BECKETT>Corey Francis is really...

555
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,430
<18-16,BECKETT>诺亚·加斯伍德
<18-16,BECKETT>Noah Kesswood.

556
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,090
<19-1,ESPOSITO>陆军情报部门的前任官员
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Former officer in the army's military intelligence corps.

557
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,030
<19-2,CASTLE>前任军情官员
<19-2,CASTLE>Former military intelligence?

558
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,490
<19-3,BECKETT>诺亚用假身份  开始和米歇尔交往
<19-3,BECKETT>Noah uses a fake identity, starts dating Michelle,

559
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,650
<19-3,BECKETT>在她遇害后便失踪了
<19-3,BECKETT>and then he disappears just after she's killed?

560
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,090
<19-4,CASTLE>《单身汉》混搭《国土安全》啊
<19-4,CASTLE>It's "The bachelor" meets "Homeland."

561
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,250
<19-5,ESPOSITO>不管他的目的是什么  唯一的线索是
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Whatever he was up to, the only trace of him I could find

562
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,450
<19-5,ESPOSITO>他的名下登记了一家转租公司
<19-5,ESPOSITO>is a loan-out corporation registered in his name.

563
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,080
<19-5,ESPOSITO>而且最近公司账户很活跃
<19-5,ESPOSITO>And there's been a lot of recent activity.

564
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,800
<19-5,ESPOSITO>收到了有几笔大额电汇
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Several large wire transfers were made

566
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,520
<19-5,ESPOSITO>都是从本地本柯舒律所汇入
<19-5,ESPOSITO>from a local law firm-- Benedict, Cole and Schuster.

567
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,220
<19-6,BECKETT>时间大概是从
<19-6,BECKETT>Those payments began around the time that

568
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,210
<19-6,BECKETT>诺亚与米歇尔约会开始
<19-6,BECKETT>Noah started dating Michelle.

569
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,740
<19-7,ESPOSITO>是不是觉得是有人雇了诺亚监视她
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Think someone was paying Noah to spy on her?

570
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,160
<19-8,CASTLE>米歇尔接的案子赚来的钱都是七位数
<19-8,CASTLE>Well, Michelle's cases had outcomes in the millions.

571
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,620
<19-8,CASTLE>没准是其他律师眼红呢
<19-8,CASTLE>Maybe an opposing lawyer was angling for an advantage.

572
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,640
<19-9,BECKETT>如果米歇尔发现自己被监视
<19-9,BECKETT>If Michelle found out that she was being spied on,

573
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,000
<19-9,BECKETT>那个律师就会面临违反职业道德的控诉
<19-9,BECKETT>then that lawyer would face an ethics violation

574
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,700
<19-9,BECKETT>以及被吊销执照
<19-9,BECKETT>and disbarment.

575
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,480
<19-10,CASTLE>足够让他绝望到花钱
<19-10,CASTLE>It might have made him desperate enough to pay Noah

576
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,760
<19-10,CASTLE>让诺亚杀了米歇尔来解决问题
<19-10,CASTLE>to kill Michelle to make the problem go away.

577
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,830
<19-11,BECKETT>有可能  最好的方法是
<19-11,BECKETT>It is possible, but the best way to find out

578
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,760
<19-11,BECKETT>找到那个付钱的律师
<19-11,BECKETT>is to track down the lawyer that authorized those payments.

579
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,250
<19-11,BECKETT>给你纸巾
<19-11,BECKETT>Here. There's the napkins.

580
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,150
<20-1,HOTDOG VENDOR>舒斯特先生
<20-1,HOTDOG VENDOR>Mr. Schuster.

581
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,220
<20-2,ESPOSITO>你的助理说能在这找到你
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Your office said we'd find you down here.

582
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,210
<20-2,ESPOSITO>我是埃斯波西托警探
<20-2,ESPOSITO>I'm Detective Esposito.

584
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,530
<20-3,SAMUEL SCHUESTER>我猜你们不是来买热狗的吧
<20-3,SAMUEL SCHUESTER>I'm guessing you're not here for the hot dogs.

585
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,990
<20-4,RYAN>我们想问几个关于诺亚·加斯伍德的问题
<20-4,RYAN>We'd like you to come answer some questions about Noah Kesswood.

586
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,620
<20-5,SCHUESTER>你们应该知道我是个刑事律师
<20-5,SCHUESTER>I'm sure you know I'm a criminal attorney

587
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,210
<20-5,SCHUESTER>清楚自己的权利
<20-5,SCHUESTER>who's very aware of his rights.

588
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,910
<20-5,SCHUESTER>我不会跟你们回警局
<20-5,SCHUESTER>I'm not going anywhere.

589
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,330
<20-6,RYAN>可以在这儿谈
<20-6,RYAN>Ah. Then we can talk here.

590
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,600
<20-7,SCHUESTER>你们如果想讨论把肉做成圆管状的优点
<20-7,SCHUESTER>You want to discuss the virtues of processed meat in tube form?

591
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,410
<20-7,SCHUESTER>我奉陪
<20-7,SCHUESTER>Fine.

592
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,150
<20-7,SCHUESTER>否则你们还是别浪费时间了
<20-7,SCHUESTER>Otherwise, you're wasting your time.

593
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,590
<20-8,ESPOSITO>不如谈谈你给诺亚·加斯伍德
<20-8,ESPOSITO>How about we discuss the wire transfers

594
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,010
<20-8,ESPOSITO>电汇的那些钱吧
<20-8,ESPOSITO>you made to Noah Kesswood,

595
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,420
<20-8,ESPOSITO>他是杀害米歇尔·图伊的嫌疑人
<20-8,ESPOSITO>a suspect in the murder of Michelle Twohey?

596
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,490
<20-9,SCHUESTER>省省你们的鹅肝  烧鸭
<20-9,SCHUESTER>Save your foie gras, your roast duck,

597
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,460
<20-9,SCHUESTER>和酒闷仔鸡吧
<20-9,SCHUESTER>your coq au vin.

598
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
<20-9,SCHUESTER>对我来说  最好吃的是纽约街头的热狗
<20-9,SCHUESTER>For me, fine dining is a New York hot dog.

599
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,070
<20-10,RYAN>舒斯特先生  最后一笔电汇的金额是一万美元
<20-10,RYAN>Mr. Schuster, we know the last transfer was for 10 grand,

600
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,550
<20-10,RYAN>在米歇尔被害那天早上汇出
<20-10,RYAN>sent the morning Michelle was murdered.

601
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,280
<20-11,ESPOSITO>像是你们律所花钱雇诺亚铲除同行
<20-11,ESPOSITO>Sounds like your law firm paid Noah to kill a fellow attorney.

602
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,080
<20-12,SCHUESTER>太荒唐了
<20-12,SCHUESTER>That's ridiculous.

603
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,430
<20-13,RYAN>也许吧  但是如果我们把证据串在一起
<20-13,RYAN>Maybe, but when we connect the dots,

604
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,400
<20-13,RYAN>你觉得媒体也会觉得荒唐吗
<20-13,RYAN>do you think the media will see it that way?

605
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,850
<20-13,RYAN>好吧
<20-13,RYAN>Okay.

606
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,750
<20-14,SCHUESTER>接下来的事情是这样的  两位警探
<20-14,SCHUESTER>Here's what's gonna happen, detectives.

607
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,280
<20-14,SCHUESTER>你们会发现我受客户委托雇佣诺亚
<20-14,SCHUESTER>You're gonna find out that I was instructed by a client

608
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,390
<20-14,SCHUESTER>帮他处理事情
<20-14,SCHUESTER>to pay Noah Kesswood for his service.

609
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,980
<20-14,SCHUESTER>你们会问处理什么事
<20-14,SCHUESTER>You're gonna ask what that service was.

610
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,590
<20-14,SCHUESTER>我会说"我不知道"
<20-14,SCHUESTER>I'm gonna say, "I don't know."

611
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,590
<20-14,SCHUESTER>然后你们会很爷们地要我说出客户的名字
<20-14,SCHUESTER>Then you're gonna puff up and demand the name of my client,

612
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,680
<20-14,SCHUESTER>我会这样回应"这是保密信息
<20-14,SCHUESTER>to which I'll reply, "That's privileged information.

613
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,530
<20-14,SCHUESTER>自己玩儿蛋去吧"
<20-14,SCHUESTER>Kindly go screw yourselves."

614
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,310
<20-14,SCHUESTER>买个热狗吧  好吃极了
<20-14,SCHUESTER>Have a hot dog, boys. They're delicious.

615
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,110
<21-1,RYAN>舒斯特也许有当事人保密特权
<21-1,RYAN>Mr. Schuster may have attorney-client privilege,

616
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,220
<21-1,RYAN>但是他的客户名字是公开的
<21-1,RYAN>but who he represents is a matter of public record.

617
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,360
<21-1,RYAN>所以我查看了他律所
<21-1,RYAN>So I looked back into his law firm's cases

618
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,580
<21-1,RYAN>五年内的案子
<21-1,RYAN>for the past five years.

619
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,190
<21-1,RYAN>结果发现舒斯特代理过比利·派珀
<21-1,RYAN>Turns out Schuster represented Billy Piper.

620
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,300
<21-1,RYAN>你们还记得那事儿吧
<21-1,RYAN>You guys remember the story, right?

621
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,210
<21-2,CASTLE>当然  新闻上播了好几个月
<21-2,CASTLE>Yeah, it was all over the news for months.

622
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,470
<21-2,CASTLE>著名高尔夫职业选手要离婚
<21-2,CASTLE>Famous pro golfer getting a divorce

623
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,020
<21-2,CASTLE>为了挽救婚姻
<21-2,CASTLE>takes a boating trip to the Caribbean

624
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,160
<21-2,CASTLE>带着老婆去加勒比海航海旅行
<21-2,CASTLE>to work on his marriage...

625
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,820
<21-3,BECKETT>只是他老婆再也没能上岸
<21-3,BECKETT>Only his wife never makes it back to shore.

626
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,730
<21-3,BECKETT>比利声称他俩喝醉了
<21-3,BECKETT>Billy claimed that the two of them were drinking,

627
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,220
<21-3,BECKETT>他妻子是意外落海
<21-3,BECKETT>and his wife accidentally fell off of the boat.

628
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,810
<21-4,CASTLE>所有人都认为这是谋杀
<21-4,CASTLE>Everyone assumed it was murder.

629
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,260
<21-4,CASTLE>但是联调局没有足够的证据起诉他
<21-4,CASTLE>But the feds never had enough to indict him.

630
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,720
<21-5,RYAN>的确
<21-5,RYAN>Indeed.

631
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,340
<21-5,RYAN>这和我们的死者有什么关系呢
<21-5,RYAN>So what does any of this have to do with our victim?

632
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,730
<21-5,RYAN>三年前
<21-5,RYAN>Three years ago,

633
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,370
<21-5,RYAN>米歇尔的一个客户从船上消失了
<21-5,RYAN>Michelle had a client who disappeared from her boat.

634
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,270
<21-5,RYAN>那个客户
<21-5,RYAN>That client...

635
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,660
<21-5,RYAN>就是莉安娜·派珀
<21-5,RYAN>was Leann Piper.

636
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,130
<21-6,BECKETT>比利·派珀的老婆
<21-6,BECKETT>Billy Piper's wife?

637
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,440
<21-6,BECKETT>这不可能是巧合
<21-6,BECKETT>That can't be a coincidence.

638
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,340
<21-7,RYAN>我也是这么想的
<21-7,RYAN>I don't think it was.

639
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,850
<21-7,RYAN>我在米歇尔的电脑上
<21-7,RYAN>In fact, I found a file...

640
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,000
<21-7,RYAN>找到了一个文件
<21-7,RYAN>on Michelle's computer that showed that

641
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,010
<21-7,RYAN>证明她在被害前一月在调查莉安娜·派珀的谋杀
<21-7,RYAN>she'd been looking into Leann Piper's murder for the past month.

642
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,620
<21-8,CASTLE>等一下
<21-8,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

643
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,170
<21-8,CASTLE>如果米歇尔发现是比利杀害了他老婆
<21-8,CASTLE>What if Michelle figured out how Billy killed his wife?

644
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,730
<21-9,RYAN>你是说找到了确凿证据吗
<21-9,RYAN>You mean by finding actual evidence?

645
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,030
<21-10,CASTLE>是的  比利想要阻止
<21-10,CASTLE>Right. Then the only way...

646
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,860
<21-10,CASTLE>证据公开的唯一方法就是
<21-10,CASTLE>Billy could stop that proof from coming out...

647
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,780
<21-11,BECKETT>杀了米歇尔
<21-11,BECKETT>Was to have Michelle killed.

648
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,910
<22-1,BILLY PIPER>那是我最引以为傲的奖杯
<22-1,BILLY PIPER>That's my pride and joy.

649
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,680
<22-1,BILLY PIPER>2002年在奥古斯塔赢的
<22-1,BILLY PIPER>Won it in Augusta in '02.

650
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,120
<22-2,CASTLE>你打出老鹰球获胜
<22-2,CASTLE>You eagled for the win.

651
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,100
<22-2,CASTLE>你没记错
<22-2,CASTLE>That's right.

652
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,060
<22-3,BILLY>你们要喝点什么吗
<22-3,BILLY>Can I get either of you two a drink?

653
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,030
<22-4,BECKETT>我们不是来串门的  派珀先生
<22-4,BECKETT>This isn't a social visit, Mr. Piper.

654
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,090
<22-4,BECKETT>我们来询问关于米歇尔·图伊的事
<22-4,BECKETT>We're here to talk to you about Michelle Twohey.

655
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,770
<22-5,BILLY>米歇尔 谁
<22-5,BILLY>Michelle who-ey?

656
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,930
<22-5,BILLY>抱歉  我没听过这个人
<22-5,BILLY>Sorry. It doesn't sound familiar.

657
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,330
<22-6,BECKETT>真是奇怪  你竟然没听过你已故妻子的离婚律师
<22-6,BECKETT>It's odd that you don't remember your late wife's divorce lawyer.

658
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,080
<22-6,BECKETT>你知道这位律师死了吗
<22-6,BECKETT>Did you know that she'd turned up dead?

659
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,190
<22-6,BECKETT>之所以来问你是因为一个月前
<22-6,BECKETT>The reason I'm asking is because she visited you

660
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,710
<22-6,BECKETT>她来找过你
<22-6,BECKETT>about a month ago.

661
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,380
<22-7,BILLY>不记得她来过
<22-7,BILLY>Hmm. Don't recall any visits.

662
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,520
<22-8,CASTLE>你确定吗
<22-8,CASTLE>You sure about that?

663
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,630
<22-8,CASTLE>那之后你就雇了诺亚·加斯伍德
<22-8,CASTLE>It was right after that visit you hired Noah Kesswood.

664
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,790
<22-9,BILLY>诺亚·加斯伍德是谁
<22-9,BILLY>Who's Noah Kesswood?

665
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,400
<22-10,BECKETT>你雇来监视她的人
<22-10,BECKETT>The man that you paid to spy on her.

666
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,720
<22-10,BECKETT>结果她就死了
<22-10,BECKETT>And then she winds up dead.

667
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,960
<22-10,BECKETT>你不觉得这很可疑吗
<22-10,BECKETT>That's awfully suspicious, don't you think?

668
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,560
<22-11,BILLY>你们这些警察啊
<22-11,BILLY>You people.

669
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,210
<22-11,BILLY>有人死了
<22-11,BILLY>Somebody dies,

670
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,700
<22-11,BILLY>就来问我
<22-11,BILLY>question Billy.

671
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,980
<22-12,CASTLE>这也不能怪我们
<22-12,CASTLE>Well, can you blame us,

672
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,320
<22-12,CASTLE>特别是在你老婆那件事之后
<22-12,CASTLE>especially after what happened with your wife?

673
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,830
<22-12,CASTLE>行了
<22-12,CASTLE>Okay.

674
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,640
<22-13,BILLY>我们来谈谈我老婆
<22-13,BILLY>Let's talk about what happened to my wife.

675
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,160
<22-13,BILLY>莉安娜起草了离婚协议  我努力挽回
<22-13,BILLY>Leann files for divorce so I fight her on it,

676
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,060
<22-13,BILLY>因为在我看来  婚姻是神圣的
<22-13,BILLY>because where I'm from, marriage is sacred.

677
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,910
<22-13,BILLY>所以莉安娜和我决定跟往常一样
<22-13,BILLY>So Leann and I decide to go for a boat ride,

678
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,760
<22-13,BILLY>去航海旅行
<22-13,BILLY>like the old days,

679
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,930
<22-13,BILLY>但此举非但没挽回我们的爱情
<22-13,BILLY>but instead of recapturing our magic,

680
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,400
<22-13,BILLY>莉安娜还醉酒失足掉到海里
<22-13,BILLY>Leann got drunk and fell into the ocean.

681
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,440
<22-13,BILLY>我怎么就成了恶人了呢
<22-13,BILLY>So why am I the bad guy?

682
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,990
<22-14,BECKETT>这么说你是受害者
<22-14,BECKETT>Oh, so you're the victim here?

683
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,440
<22-15,BILLY>我当然是
<22-15,BILLY>You bet your ass, I am.

684
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,670
<22-15,BILLY>我失去了广告代言和社会地位
<22-15,BILLY>I lost my endorsements and my status.

685
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,850
<22-15,BILLY>我的家人也不再理我了
<22-15,BILLY>My own family wants nothing to do with me.

686
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,570
<22-16,BECKETT>有意思的是
<22-16,BECKETT>Interesting.

687
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,120
<22-16,BECKETT>你的"失物清单"里
<22-16,BECKETT>On the list of things you lost,

688
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,740
<22-16,BECKETT>没有你老婆
<22-16,BECKETT>you didn't include your wife.

689
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,520
<22-17,BILLY>她从来都不是我的最爱
<22-17,BILLY>She never was my favorite trophy.

690
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,440
<22-17,BILLY>你们也该滚蛋了
<22-17,BILLY>Now why don't you two get the hell out of my home?

691
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,310
<23-1,CASTLE>肯定是比利干的
<23-1,CASTLE>Well, Billy did it.

692
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,450
<23-1,CASTLE>他为了保住他的钱杀了他老婆
<23-1,CASTLE>He killed his wife to keep his money,

693
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,880
<23-1,CASTLE>当米歇尔发现证据后又杀了米歇尔
<23-1,CASTLE>Then had Michelle murdered when she found evidence of it.

694
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,250
<23-1,CASTLE>唯一的问题是怎么证明
<23-1,CASTLE>Only how do we prove it?

695
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,730
<23-2,BECKETT>所有的线索都指向诺亚
<23-2,BECKETT>Well, all roads lead to Noah.

696
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,880
<23-2,BECKETT>所以如果我们能抓到他
<23-2,BECKETT>So if we can catch him,

697
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,150
<23-2,BECKETT>就可以让他指正比利
<23-2,BECKETT>we'll get him to turn on Billy.

698
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,390
<23-3,CASTLE>好办法
<23-3,CASTLE>Perfect.

699
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,550
<23-3,CASTLE>只是我们找不到他
<23-3,CASTLE>Only we don't have any way of finding him.

<23-5,RYAN>The manager was able to pull up the records

704
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,970
<23-5,RYAN>在那儿停车的记录
<23-5,RYAN>of when Noah parked there,

705
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,960
<23-5,RYAN>我们得到了他的车牌号

706
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,490
<23-6,ESPOSITO>那辆车属于一个车队

00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,670
<23-7,BECKETT>诺亚是那儿的员工吗
<23-7,BECKETT>Was Noah an employee there?

709
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,450
<23-8,RYAN>不  他跟那儿没关系
<23-8,RYAN>No, he has no affiliation.

00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,350
<23-9,BECKETT>你们继续查下去
<23-9,BECKETT>All right. You guys keep digging.

711
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,130
<23-9,BECKETT>这之间一定有什么联系
<23-9,BECKETT>There's gotta be a connection somewhere.

728
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,370
<23-15,BECKETT>不是显得我不自信吗
<23-15,BECKETT>that would've made me look insecure.

729
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,030
<23-16,CASTLE>真的很糟糕吗
<23-16,CASTLE>Is this as bad as it seems?

733
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,660
<23-18,CASTLE>然后再想一下
<23-18,CASTLE>and let's just think about it.

749
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,830
<23-30,ESPOSITO>而你又不想让贝克特知道的
<23-30,ESPOSITO>that you don't want Beckett to know?

<27-1,NOAH>You want the truth?

811
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,220
<27-1,NOAH>好吧  告诉你  不收费
<27-1,NOAH>Okay, here it is free of charge.

812
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,870
<27-1,NOAH>比利·派珀非常多疑
<27-1,NOAH>Billy Piper's absolutely paranoid.

813
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,400
<27-1,NOAH>当米歇尔跑来
<27-1,NOAH>So when Michelle came around asking questions

814
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,570
<27-1,NOAH>问那晚在船上的事
<27-1,NOAH>about that night on the boat,

815
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,460
<27-1,NOAH>他完全慌了
<27-1,NOAH>he went into full-on panic mode.

816
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,310
<27-1,NOAH>他认为她要报复他
<27-1,NOAH>Figured she probably had a vendetta against him,

817
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,160
<27-1,NOAH>想让他因谋杀她的客户而坐牢
<27-1,NOAH>wanted him in jail for murdering her client.

818
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,180
<27-1,NOAH>事实上  他想的没错
<27-1,NOAH>Reality is, he was probably right.

819
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,260
<27-1,NOAH>她说她离查明船上究竟发生了什么
<27-1,NOAH>She said she was close, very close,

820
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,150
<27-1,NOAH>已经非常非常接近了
<27-1,NOAH>to finding out what really happened on that boat.

821
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,830
<27-2,BECKETT>-你指的是确凿的证据吗  -也许吧
<27-2,BECKETT>- Are we talking actual evidence? - Maybe.

822
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,330
<27-3,NOAH>她当时正在缉毒局的纽约办公室
<27-3,NOAH>She was gathering the final puzzle pieces

823
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,860
<27-3,NOAH>寻找最后一环线索
<27-3,NOAH>at the New York office of the D.E.A.

824
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,740
<27-4,BECKETT>为什么是缉毒局
<27-4,BECKETT>The drug enforcement agency, why?

825
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,580
<27-5,NOAH>那你得问他们了  警探
<27-5,NOAH>You'd have to ask them, detective.

826
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,620
<27-6,BECKETT>好吧  不过我还得扣留你  知道吗
<27-6,BECKETT>Okay. Well, I'm still gonna have to hold you, you know?

827
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,320
<27-7,NOAH>最多24小时
<27-7,NOAH>For up to 24 hours.

828
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,860
<27-7,NOAH>然后你们就不会再见到我了
<27-7,NOAH>And then you'll never see me again.

829
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,290
<28-1,RYAN>好的  多谢  比尔
<28-1,RYAN>All right. Thanks, Bill.

830
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,380
<28-1,RYAN>诺亚的不在场证明可靠
<28-1,RYAN>Well, Noah's alibi is solid.

831
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,980
<28-1,RYAN>他不是凶手
<28-1,RYAN>He's definitely not the killer.

832
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,690
<28-2,CASTLE>但我们要相信他缉毒局那一套说辞吗
<28-2,CASTLE>But do we believe his story about the D.E.A.?

833
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,650
<28-2,CASTLE>我是说  这个案子和毒品有什么关系
<28-2,CASTLE>I mean, what does any of this have to do with drugs?

834
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,050
<28-3,BECKETT>只有一种方法能查明
<28-3,BECKETT>Well, there's only one way to find out.

835
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,370
<28-3,BECKETT>莱恩  看看你能不能查出
<28-3,BECKETT>Ryan, see if you can uncover

836
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,640
<28-3,BECKETT>米歇尔在缉毒局做什么
<28-3,BECKETT>what Michelle was doing at the D.E.A.

837
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,540
<28-4,RYAN>我会试试看  但现在太晚了
<28-4,RYAN>I'll try, but it's late.

838
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,210
<28-4,RYAN>明早前大概不会有什么消息
<28-4,RYAN>Probably won't hear anything till the morning.

839
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,820
<28-5,BECKETT>今天就到这儿吧
<28-5,BECKETT>Well, I guess we should call it a night.

840
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,440
<28-5,BECKETT>好吧  卡塞尔  回见
<28-5,BECKETT>Okay, Castle. See you later.

841
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,160
<28-6,CASTLE>回见  我们可以一起回我家
<28-6,CASTLE>Later? We can go back to my place together.

842
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,020
<28-7,BECKETT>我要跟你前妻吃晚餐  记得吗
<28-7,BECKETT>Um, I have a dinner date with your ex-wife, remember?

843
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,110
<28-8,CASTLE>我记得
<28-8,CASTLE>Yeah. I remember.

844
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,830
<28-8,CASTLE>我只是希望你忘了
<28-8,CASTLE>I was just hoping you'd forget.

845
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,410
<28-9,BECKETT>不用等我了
<28-9,BECKETT>Okay. Don't wait up.

846
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,600
<28-9,BECKETT>我...
<28-9,BECKETT>I...

<29-2,CASTLE>I can't relax, mother.

849
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,780
<29-2,CASTLE>我的世界天旋地转
<29-2,CASTLE>My--my worlds are colliding, okay?

850
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,000
<29-2,CASTLE>我无法放松
<29-2,CASTLE>I'm not-- I can't relax.

851
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,470
<29-3,MARTHA>来杯酒吧  对我有用
<29-3,MARTHA>Well, have a glass of wine. Works for me.

852
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,300
<29-4,CASTLE>我打赌她们现在在外面
<29-4,CASTLE>I bet there out there right now,

853
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,940
<29-4,CASTLE>正聊着我的秘密呢
<29-4,CASTLE>just telling secrets about me.

854
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,960
<29-4,CASTLE>糟糕  我该怎么做
<29-4,CASTLE>Boom. What do I do?

<29-4,CASTLE>我该打给他们吗  我该打给他们
<29-4,CASTLE>Should I call them? I should call them.

856
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,960
<29-4,CASTLE>不不不
<29-4,CASTLE>No, no, no.

857
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
<29-5,MARTHA>你当初就不该
<29-5,MARTHA>What you shouldn't have done

858
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,020
<29-5,MARTHA>让梅瑞狄斯住下来
<29-5,MARTHA>was let Meredith stay here in the first place.

859
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,370
<29-5,MARTHA>这里可不是廉价旅馆  亲爱的
<29-5,MARTHA>This isn't a flophouse, darling.

860
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,160
<29-5,MARTHA>你不该再让吃白食的人留宿
<29-5,MARTHA>You've got to stop letting freeloaders just live here.

861
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,490
<29-6,CASTLE>母亲大人你这么说不觉得讽刺吗
<29-6,CASTLE>Please tell me you see the irony.

862
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,470
<29-7,BECKETT>天啊  梅瑞狄斯  卡塞尔做了什么
<29-7,BECKETT>My god, Meredith. Castle did that?

863
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,560
<29-7,BECKETT>我不敢相信你会嫁给他
<29-7,BECKETT>I can't believe that you married him.

864
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,770
<29-8,CASTLE>你不敢相信什么
<29-8,CASTLE>What can't you believe?

865
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,740
<29-8,CASTLE>什么  不  什么
<29-8,CASTLE>What? No. What?

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,800
<29-8,CASTLE>不  拜托
<29-8,CASTLE>No. Come on.

867
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,820
<29-8,CASTLE>贝克特  故事都有两面性
<29-8,CASTLE>Beckett, there's two sides to that story.

868
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,970
<29-8,CASTLE>你说了  什么故事  你告诉她什么了
<29-8,CASTLE>That--what did you--what story--what did you tell her?

869
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,210
<29-9,MEREDITH>真相  理查德
<29-9,MEREDITH>The truth, Richard.

870
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,540
<29-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不是我以为我了解的那个人
<29-10,BECKETT>Castle, you're not the man that I thought I knew.

871
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,930
<29-11,CASTLE>我以前是
<29-11,CASTLE>I'm the man you thought you knew.

872
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,520
<29-11,CASTLE>现在也是  我以为你
<29-11,CASTLE>I'm the man you know. I thought you--

873
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,000
<29-11,CASTLE>我就是  你以为  我了解你
<29-11,CASTLE>I'm that--you think-- I know you.

874
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,800
<29-11,CASTLE>我就是他
<29-11,CASTLE>I'm him.

875
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,130
<29-12,CASTLE>这太没劲了
<29-12,CASTLE>This is so not cool.

876
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,750
<29-13,BECKETT>你说得对  他确实会向左倾
<29-13,BECKETT>Oh, you're right. He does lean to the left.

877
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,670
<29-14,MEREDITH>说了吧  一紧张就这样
<29-14,MEREDITH>Told ya. Only when he's stressed.

878
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,130
<29-15,BECKETT>我之前没发现
<29-15,BECKETT>I've never even noticed that before.

879
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,650
<29-16,CASTLE>什么  什么倾斜
<29-16,CASTLE>What? D--what leans?

<29-17,BECKETT>谢谢你  梅瑞狄斯  太有趣了
<29-17,BECKETT>Thank you, Meredith. That was so fun.

<29-18,MEREDITH>谢谢你能来
<29-18,MEREDITH>Mm. Thanks for coming.

<30-1,CASTLE>拜托  我懂了  我懂了
<30-1,CASTLE>Oh, come on. I get it. I get it.

886
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,810
<30-1,CASTLE>这事我处理得不妥  对不起
<30-1,CASTLE>I mishandled this whole thing, and I am sorry.

00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,500
<30-1,CASTLE>相信我  我很抱歉
<30-1,CASTLE>Believe me, I am sorry.

888
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,090
<30-1,CASTLE>求你告诉梅瑞狄斯说了什么
<30-1,CASTLE>Please tell me what Meredith said.

889
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,840
<30-1,CASTLE>说了什么我需要担心的吗
<30-1,CASTLE>Is it anything I need to be worried about?

890
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,330
<30-2,BECKETT>你知道吗  卡塞尔
<30-2,BECKETT>You know what, Castle?

891
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,690
<30-2,BECKETT>虽然继续折磨你很有趣
<30-2,BECKETT>As much as fun as it would be to continue torturing you,

892
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,220
<30-2,BECKETT>不过我现在更喜欢你了
<30-2,BECKETT>I actually like you a little bit more now.

893
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,230
<30-3,CASTLE>真的吗
<30-3,CASTLE>You do?

894
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,890
<30-4,BECKETT>是啊  梅瑞狄斯是个有趣
<30-4,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. Yeah. Meredith is a fun,

895
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,890
<30-4,BECKETT>充满活力  让人无法拒绝的女人
<30-4,BECKETT>dynamic, and hard-to-say-no-to woman.

896
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,730
<30-4,BECKETT>但是
<30-4,BECKETT>But...

897
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,380
<30-4,BECKETT>只要我们还在一起  她不能再住在这里了
<30-4,BECKETT>as long as we're together, she never stays here again.

898
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,530
<30-5,CASTLE>绝无异议
<30-5,CASTLE>That goes without saying.

899
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,490
<30-6,BECKETT>好吧
<30-6,BECKETT>Okay.

900
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,000
<30-7,CASTLE>转到语音信箱吧
<30-7,CASTLE>Mm. Let it go to voice mail.

901
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,320
<30-6,BECKETT>好的
<30-6,BECKETT>Okay. Mm.

902
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,810
<30-9,BECKETT>是分局打来的
<30-9,BECKETT>Oh, it's the precinct.

903
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,220
<30-11,BECKETT>-什么事  -贝克特
<30-11,BECKETT>- What? - Beckett.

904
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,130
<30-12,RYAN>我刚刚联络了缉毒局的人
<30-12,RYAN>Hey, I just got off with the D.E.A.

905
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,280
<30-12,RYAN>你得尽快赶过来
<30-12,RYAN>You need to get down here right now.

906
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,640
<30-13,BECKETT>我们马上就到
<30-13,BECKETT>Yeah, okay. We'll be right there.

907
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,350
<31-1,RYAN>米歇尔对缉毒局的
<31-1,RYAN>Michelle was very interested

908
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,990
<31-1,RYAN>加勒比缉毒行动非常感兴趣
<31-1,RYAN>in the D.E.A.'s caribbean drug interdiction efforts,

909
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,150
<31-1,RYAN>这其中包括使用卫星照片
<31-1,RYAN>which involve the tracking of planes and boats

910
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,650
<31-1,RYAN>追踪飞机和船只
<31-1,RYAN>using satellite photos.

911
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,790
<31-1,RYAN>她拿到了三年前莉安娜·派珀
<31-1,RYAN>She obtained this 3-year-old satellite photo

912
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,470
<31-1,RYAN>被杀当晚的卫星照片
<31-1,RYAN>from the night of Leann Piper's murder.

913
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,810
<31-1,RYAN>瞧
<31-1,RYAN>Take a look.

914
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,850
<31-2,CASTLE>有两艘船
<31-2,CASTLE>There's two boats.

915
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,450
<31-3,RYAN>对  距离不超过50英尺
<31-3,RYAN>Yeah, less than 50 feet apart.

916
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,800
<31-3,RYAN>而且他们确认其中一艘是比利·派珀的
<31-3,RYAN>And they identified that one as Billy Piper's.

917
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,240
<31-4,BECKETT>这就是他脱罪的方法
<31-4,BECKETT>That's how he got away with it.

918
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,980
<31-4,BECKETT>也是莉安娜的尸体没被发现的原因
<31-4,BECKETT>That's why Leann was never found.

919
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,180
<31-4,BECKETT>比利害怕她的尸体被冲上岸
<31-4,BECKETT>Billy was afraid that her body would wash up,

920
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,600
<31-4,BECKETT>所以他找了个同谋帮他把尸体
<31-4,BECKETT>So he enlisted an accomplice to take the remains

921
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,240
<31-4,BECKETT>扔到了没人能找到的地方
<31-4,BECKETT>and dump them where nobody would ever look.

922
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,950
<31-5,CASTLE>如果米歇尔知道了这件事
<31-5,CASTLE>If Michelle got on to this,

923
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,850
<31-5,CASTLE>那么那个同谋很可能就是杀害她的凶手
<31-5,CASTLE>that accomplice might be the person who murdered her.

924
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,740
<31-6,BECKETT>没错  但是她怎么知道去找另一艘船呢
<31-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but how did she know to look for another boat?

925
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,100
<31-7,RYAN>那艘船最近被列为
<31-7,RYAN>It was recently listed as an asset

926
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,170
<31-7,RYAN>她离婚案的资产之一
<31-7,RYAN>in one of her divorce cases.

927
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,740
<31-7,RYAN>伙计们  你们绝对猜不到同谋是谁
<31-7,RYAN>And, guys, you're never gonna guess who the accomplice is.

928
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,430
<32-1,CASTLE>你好  沃尔特
<32-1,CASTLE>Hello, Walter.

929
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,640
<32-2,WALTER>找我有事吗
<32-2,WALTER>Can I help you?

930
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,090
<32-3,CASTLE>是  我们因为一艘船来找一个人
<32-3,CASTLE>Yeah, we're here to see a man about a boat.

931
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,110
<32-3,CASTLE>我为什么要杀我前妻的离婚律师
<32-3,CASTLE>Why would I kill my ex-wife's divorce lawyer?

932
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,790
<33-1,WALTER>她干得"好极"了
<33-1,WALTER>She did a terrible job.

933
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,740
<33-1,WALTER>就因为如此  我才赢了
<33-1,WALTER>And because of that, I won.

934
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,840
<33-2,BECKETT>你想知道你为什么赢了吗
<33-2,BECKETT>Do you want to know why you won?

935
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,150
<33-2,BECKETT>因为米歇尔把所有的时间
<33-2,BECKETT>Because Michelle was spending all of her time

936
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,130
<33-2,BECKETT>花在筛查你近三年的财务政信息上
<33-2,BECKETT>sifting through your financials from three years ago.

937
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,790
<33-3,RYAN>她很好奇你家
<33-3,RYAN>She became very interested in how your family

938
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,730
<33-3,RYAN>和比利·派珀家是怎么成为
<33-3,RYAN>and Billy Piper's family

939
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,830
<33-3,RYAN>同一家游艇俱乐部会员的
<33-3,RYAN>were all members of the same yacht club.

940
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,800
<33-4,WALTER>所以呢
<33-4,WALTER>So?

941
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,220
<33-5,RYAN>你和比利 Pier是朋友
<33-5,RYAN>You and Billy Piper were friends.

942
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,930
<33-6,WALTER>我再说一次  所以呢
<33-6,WALTER>Again, I respond, so?

943
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,080
<33-6,WALTER>所以
<33-6,WALTER>So...

944
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,090
<33-7,BECKETT>米歇尔发现证据证明
<33-7,BECKETT>Michelle found proof that you refueled your boat

945
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,240
<33-7,BECKETT>你在比利妻子被害的水域加过油
<33-7,BECKETT>near the waters where billy's wife was killed.

946
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,670
<33-8,RYAN>她用卫星图片追踪到你的船
<33-8,RYAN>She tracked your boat using satellite photos.

947
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,870
<33-8,RYAN>这是比利·派珀的船  也是他妻子最后被看到的地方
<33-8,RYAN>This is Billy Piper's boat, where his wife was last seen.

948
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,810
<33-8,RYAN>而这里是谁的船呢
<33-8,RYAN>And whose boat is this over here?

949
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,450
<33-8,RYAN>哦  是你的
<33-8,RYAN>Oh, it's yours.

950
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,190
<33-9,BECKETT>缉毒局确认这是你的船
<33-9,BECKETT>The D.E.A. identified it as your boat.

951
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,580
<33-9,BECKETT>你是比利的同谋
<33-9,BECKETT>You were Billy's accomplice.

952
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,050
<33-10,RYAN>你们的计划不错
<33-10,RYAN>The two of you had a pretty good plan,

953
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,980
<33-10,RYAN>但却有一件事没有料到
<33-10,RYAN>except for there was one thing you couldn't foresee.

954
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,820
<33-11,BECKETT>那就是你妻子会雇米歇尔
<33-11,BECKETT>That your wife would hire Michelle

955
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,400
<33-11,BECKETT>代理她的离婚案
<33-11,BECKETT>to represent her in your divorce.

956
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,210
<33-12,RYAN>米歇尔可能是在找外遇的证据
<33-12,RYAN>Michelle was probably looking for proof of an affair.

957
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,100
<33-13,BECKETT>却发现了更严重的事情
<33-13,BECKETT>Except she found something much worse.

958
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,480
<33-13,BECKETT>去加勒比的那次航行
<33-13,BECKETT>That little boat trip you took to the caribbean?

959
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,900
<33-13,BECKETT>当她仔细调查
<33-13,BECKETT>As she looked closer

960
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,070
<33-13,BECKETT>和你在一起的人和你去的原因时
<33-13,BECKETT>at who you were with and why you were there,

961
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,030
<33-13,BECKETT>她就发现了真相
<33-13,BECKETT>she discovered the truth.

962
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,350
<33-14,WALTER>我想和我的律师谈谈
<33-14,WALTER>I want to talk to my lawyer.

963
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,310
<34-1,BECKETT>没有认罪  我们的案子也只是猜测
<34-1,BECKETT>Without a confession, our case is purely speculative.

964
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,800
<34-2,CASTLE>我们可以进一步调查沃尔特
<34-2,CASTLE>Well, we could dig into Walter's life,

965
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,870
<34-2,CASTLE>没准能找到证据
<34-2,CASTLE>Maybe find some proof.

966
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,490
<34-3,BECKETT>要是幸运还能找到动机
<34-3,BECKETT>And some motive, too, if we're lucky.

967
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,780
<34-4,CASTLE>看来觉得这事蹊跷的不只是我
<34-4,CASTLE>Okay, so it's not just me?

968
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,310
<34-4,CASTLE>沃尔特应该没什么真正的动机吧
<34-4,CASTLE>Walter has no real motive, does he?

969
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,150
<34-5,BECKETT>没有  但他为何要帮比利杀害他的妻子呢
<34-5,BECKETT>No. I mean, why would walter help Billy kill his wife?

970
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,460
<34-5,BECKETT>没错  他们是朋友  但沃尔特能得到什么呢
<34-5,BECKETT>Yeah, sure, they're friends, but what was in it for Walter?

971
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,560
<34-6,CASTLE>他们又不是达成一致互杀妻子
<34-6,CASTLE>Well, it's not like they agreed to kill each others' wives,

972
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,720
<34-6,CASTLE>就像《火车怪客》一样
<34-6,CASTLE>like "Strangers on a Train."

973
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,850
<34-6,CASTLE>但通过我们所看到沃尔特的夫妻关系
<34-6,CASTLE>Though what we saw of... Walter's relationship,

974
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:45,870
<34-6,CASTLE>我敢肯定他考虑过
<34-6,CASTLE>I'm sure he thought about it.

975
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,910
<34-6,CASTLE>伙计们
<34-6,CASTLE>Hey, guys.

976
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,580
<34-7,ESPOSITO>我在沃尔特的电话记录里发现了线索
<34-7,ESPOSITO>I found something in Walter's phone records,

977
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,960
<34-7,ESPOSITO>但我不确定这有什么用
<34-7,ESPOSITO>and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

978
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,550
<34-7,ESPOSITO>在米歇尔遇害的当天早上
<34-7,ESPOSITO>On the morning of Michelle's murder,

979
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,890
<34-7,ESPOSITO>沃尔特给嘉瑞森家打了20分钟电话
<34-7,ESPOSITO>Walter made a 20-minute phone call to the Garrison residence.

980
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,070
<34-8,BECKETT>嘉瑞森  那个会计师
<34-8,BECKETT>Garrison--the accountant

981
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,480
<34-8,BECKETT>就是米歇尔迫不及待要见的人
<34-8,BECKETT>that michelle was so desperate to meet?

982
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,290
<34-8,BECKETT>沃尔特为什么给他打电话
<34-8,BECKETT>Why would Walter call him?

983
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,440
<34-9,CASTLE>这是谁
<34-9,CASTLE>Who's this?

984
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,350
<34-10,ESPOSITO>我的梦中情人
<34-10,ESPOSITO>The woman of my dreams.

985
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,160
<34-10,ESPOSITO>她嫁给了会计师
<34-10,ESPOSITO>She's married to that accountant.

986
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,070
<34-11,CASTLE>伙计们  看看比利的
<34-11,CASTLE>Guys, look at Billy's...

987
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,420
<34-11,CASTLE>亡妻
<34-11,CASTLE>dead wife.

988
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,790
<34-11,CASTLE>再看看会计师的妻子
<34-11,CASTLE>And now look at the accountant's wife.

989
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,830
<34-11,CASTLE>发型不同  鼻子不同  下巴不同  但是
<34-11,CASTLE>Different hair, different nose, different chin, but...

990
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,040
<34-12,BECKETT>她们是同一个女人
<34-12,BECKETT>They're the same woman.

991
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,660
<34-13,CASTLE>这就是为何他们没有发现尸体
<34-13,CASTLE>That's why they never found a body,

992
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,000
<34-13,CASTLE>因为比利的亡妻莉安娜
<34-13,CASTLE>Because Billy's dead wife Leann...

993
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,750
<34-13,CASTLE>还活着
<34-13,CASTLE>is alive.

994
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,700
<35-1,BECKETT>嘉瑞森太太  再一次感谢
<35-1,BECKETT>Again, thank you, Mrs. Garrison

995
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,000
<35-1,BECKETT>您能这么晚赶过来
<35-1,BECKETT>for coming down here at such a late hour.

996
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,950
<35-2,JANE GARRISON>我丈夫不是已经回答过警探们所有的问题了吗
<35-2,JANE GARRISON>Didn't my husband answer all the other detectives' questions?

997
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,320
<35-3,CASTLE>是的  但有一个问题
<35-3,CASTLE>Oh, he did, but there was just one...

998
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,280
<35-3,CASTLE>只有你能回答
<35-3,CASTLE>that only you can answer.

999
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,020
<35-3,CASTLE>这个女人是谁
<35-3,CASTLE>Who's this woman?

1000
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,840
<35-4,BECKETT>来  我帮你拿
<35-4,BECKETT>Oh, here. Let me get that for you.

1001
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,700
<35-6,BECKETT>-谢谢  -没事
<35-6,BECKETT>- Thank you. - Yeah.

1002
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,500
<35-7,JANE>对不起  我不认识她
<35-7,JANE>Sorry. I don't recognize her.

1003
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,820
<35-7,JANE>你确定吗
<35-7,JANE>You sure about that?

1004
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,220
<35-8,BECKETT>你知道的
<35-8,BECKETT>Because, you know,

1005
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,000
<35-8,BECKETT>名字可以改  相貌可以整
<35-8,BECKETT>you can change your name, you can change your looks,

1006
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,610
<35-8,BECKETT>但有一点你改变不了
<35-8,BECKETT>but there is one thing that you cannot change--

1007
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,630
<35-8,BECKETT>你的
<35-8,BECKETT>Your...

1008
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,860
<35-8,BECKETT>指纹
<35-8,BECKETT>fingerprints.

1009
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,440
<35-8,BECKETT>我们知道你是谁
<35-8,BECKETT>We know who you are.

1010
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,610
<35-9,CASTLE>你好  莉安娜
<35-9,CASTLE>Hello, Leann.

1011
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,400
<35-9,CASTLE>欢迎你死而复生
<35-9,CASTLE>Welcome back from the dead.

1012
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,790
<35-10,JANE>我觉得你们一定认错人了
<35-10,JANE>I think you must have the wrong person.

1013
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,150
<35-11,BECKETT>你可以歇歇了  莉安娜
<35-11,BECKETT>You can drop the charade, Leann.

1014
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,220
<35-11,BECKETT>我们和你现任丈夫谈过了
<35-11,BECKETT>We spoke with your current husband.

1015
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,540
<35-11,BECKETT>他说在米歇尔被害的当晚
<35-11,BECKETT>He said that you drove into the city

1016
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,930
<35-11,BECKETT>你驱车进城
<35-11,BECKETT>the night that Michelle was killed,

1017
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,520
<35-11,BECKETT>他也认出了凶器
<35-11,BECKETT>and he also identified the murder weapon

1018
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,170
<35-11,BECKETT>是一把你们厨房丢失的
<35-11,BECKETT>as a mahogany-handled ice pick

1019
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,780
<35-11,BECKETT>红木手柄的冰锥
<35-11,BECKETT>missing from your kitchen.

1020
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,010
<35-12,CASTLE>说来真是可笑  一分钟前
<35-12,CASTLE>You know, it's funny, for a minute there,

1021
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,970
<35-12,CASTLE>我们认为沃尔特是在帮助比利
<35-12,CASTLE>We thought Walter was helping Billy.

1022
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,180
<35-12,CASTLE>但其实他是在帮助你
<35-12,CASTLE>But actually, he was helping you.

1023
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,850
<35-13,BECKETT>但是我们想不出来原因是什么
<35-13,BECKETT>The only thing that we couldn't figure out was why?

1024
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,320
<35-13,BECKETT>你为什么要如此大费周折
<35-13,BECKETT>Why did you go through all of this?

1025
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,940
<35-14,JANE>因为每个人都喜欢比利
<35-14,JANE>Because everybody loved Billy.

1026
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,790
<35-14,JANE>嫁给他你就会明白
<35-14,JANE>You try being married to him.

1027
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
<35-14,JANE>他人前是个英雄  在家是个畜生
<35-14,JANE>He was a hero in public and a monster at home.

1028
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,390
<35-14,JANE>当我终于有勇气和他离婚的时候
<35-14,JANE>When I finally got the courage to divorce him,

1029
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,030
<35-14,JANE>你知道媒体怎么描述我
<35-14,JANE>you know how the media portrayed me?

1030
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,450
<35-15,BECKETT>骗取一半财产的
<35-15,BECKETT>As just another gold digging trophy wife,

1031
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,730
<35-15,BECKETT>拜金花瓶妻子
<35-15,BECKETT>looking for her half.

1032
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,340
<35-16,JANE>他让我名誉扫地
<35-16,JANE>He destroyed my reputation.

1033
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,720
<35-16,JANE>他还打算毁掉我
<35-16,JANE>He was gonna destroy me.

1034
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,950
<35-16,JANE>唯一能让我重新开始的方法就是死
<35-16,JANE>The only way I could get my life back was to die.

1035
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,010
<35-17,CASTLE>但你需要帮手
<35-17,CASTLE>But you needed help.

1036
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,800
<35-18,JANE>而沃尔特需要钱
<35-18,JANE>And Walter needed the money.

1037
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,310
<35-18,JANE>至少他当时需要
<35-18,JANE>At least he did at the time.

1038
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,860
<35-18,JANE>于是我们拟定了计划
<35-18,JANE>So we devised a plan.

1039
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,630
<35-18,JANE>我说服比利同意旅行
<35-18,JANE>I convinced Billy to take the trip,

1040
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,020
<35-18,JANE>用威士忌把他灌醉睡着后
<35-18,JANE>and then when the scotch put him to sleep...

1041
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,600
<35-19,BECKETT>你跑到了沃尔特的船上
<35-19,BECKETT>You escaped on to Walter's boat,

1042
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,120
<35-19,BECKETT>将你的丈夫变成了杀妻凶手
<35-19,BECKETT>turning your husband into a wife killer.

1043
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,540
<35-20,JANE>他活该有这下场
<35-20,JANE>It's what he deserved.

1044
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,000
<35-20,JANE>我却得以重新开始
<35-20,JANE>And I got to start over.

1045
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,900
<35-20,JANE>我应该去国外的
<35-20,JANE>I was supposed to leave the country,

1046
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,780
<35-20,JANE>但我遇到了罗伯
<35-20,JANE>but I met Rob, and...

1047
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,600
<35-20,JANE>我爱上了他
<35-20,JANE>I fell for him.

1048
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,400
<35-20,JANE>我们在一起好开心
<35-20,JANE>We were so happy.

1049
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,710
<35-21,CASTLE>直到米歇尔将种种线索联系在一起
<35-21,CASTLE>Until Michelle put the pieces together.

1050
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,940
<35-22,JANE>她说她无法容忍法律下的不公正
<35-22,JANE>She said she couldn't live with the injustice.

1051
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,760
<35-22,JANE>你们能相信这话吗  从律师口中说出来
<35-22,JANE>I mean, can you believe that, from a lawyer?

1052
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,490
<35-22,JANE>她居然支持比利
<35-22,JANE>She sided with Billy.

1053
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,270
<35-22,JANE>她知道他的为人
<35-22,JANE>I mean, she knew what he was like.

1054
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,680
<35-22,JANE>她知道他对我的所作所为
<35-22,JANE>She knew what he did to me.

1055
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,100
<35-22,JANE>她为什么不能睁只眼闭只眼呢
<35-22,JANE>Why couldn't she just leave it alone?

1056
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,870
<35-23,BECKETT>站起来
<35-23,BECKETT>Stand up.

1057
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,800
<35-23,BECKETT>快点  站起来
<35-23,BECKETT>Let's go. Come on. Stand up.

1058
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,590
<35-24,BECKETT>转过身
<35-24,BECKETT>Turn around.

1059
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,640
<35-24,BECKETT>双手放在后面
<35-24,BECKETT>Hands behind your back.

1060
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,170
<35-24,BECKETT>莉安娜·派珀  你因谋杀米歇尔·图伊
<35-24,BECKETT>Leann Piper, you are under arrest

1061
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,280
<35-24,BECKETT>而被逮捕
<35-24,BECKETT>for the murder of Michelle Twohey.

1062
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,610
<36-1,CASTLE>我知道你的公寓可以住人了
<36-1,CASTLE>I mean, I know your apartment is habitable again,

1063
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,810
<36-1,CASTLE>我只是...  你一定要走吗
<36-1,CASTLE>I just... do you have to leave?

1064
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,250
<36-2,BECKETT>你想我留在这里  是真心不要我走
<36-2,BECKETT>Do you want me here because you actually want me here

1065
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,630
<36-2,BECKETT>还是需要我保护你不受红发魔女的摧残
<36-2,BECKETT>or do you need protection from the redheads?

1066
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,180
<36-3,CASTLE>两个原因都有
<36-3,CASTLE>A little of both.

1067
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,450
<36-4,BECKETT>好的  这样吧
<36-4,BECKETT>Okay, I'll tell you what.

1068
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,100
<36-4,BECKETT>如果你没办法应付了
<36-4,BECKETT>If it gets to be too much,

1069
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,760
<36-4,BECKETT>你可以  来我家住
<36-4,BECKETT>You can come and stay... at my place.

1070
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,870
<36-5,CASTLE>谢谢
<36-5,CASTLE>Thank you.

1071
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,680
<36-6,MEREDITH>我一个人去巴黎  不带上你
<36-6,MEREDITH>Are you sure it's okay that I'm going to Paris

1072
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,380
<36-6,MEREDITH>真的可以吗
<36-6,MEREDITH>without you?

1073
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,260
<36-7,ALEXIS>虽然我生病了  你也不应该错过啊
<36-7,ALEXIS>Just because I'm sick, you shouldn't miss it.

1074
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,320
<36-7,ALEXIS>我要你去
<36-7,ALEXIS>I want you to go.

1075
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,040
<36-8,MARTHA>我们都是这样想
<36-8,MARTHA>We all do.

1076
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,890
<36-9,CASTLE>现在什么情况
<36-9,CASTLE>What's going on?

1077
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,170
<36-10,ALEXIS>我只是感觉好内疚
<36-10,ALEXIS>I just feel so guilty

1078
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,520
<36-10,ALEXIS>因为我生病害妈妈错过了假期
<36-10,ALEXIS>that mom is missing her vacation because I'm sick,

1079
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,270
<36-10,ALEXIS>所以我让她替我们两个好好去玩
<36-10,ALEXIS>so I told her to enjoy Paris for the both of us.

1080
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,690
<36-11,CASTLE>你确定吗  阿丽克西斯  你妈妈...
<36-11,CASTLE>Oh, are you sure, Alexis? I mean, your mother...

1081
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,210
<36-11,CASTLE>应该
<36-11,CASTLE>Should...

1082
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,140
<36-11,CASTLE>享受她的假期
<36-11,CASTLE>Enjoy her vacation.

1083
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,540
<36-11,CASTLE>一路平安  梅瑞德斯
<36-11,CASTLE>Have a safe trip, Meredith.

1084
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,560
<36-13,ALEXIS>我爱你  妈妈
<36-13,ALEXIS>Je t'aime, maman.

1085
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,460
<36-14,MEREDITH>我也爱你
<36-14,MEREDITH>Moi aussi. Je t'aime.

1086
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,130
<36-15,MARTHA>拜拜了您呐  玩得开心
<36-15,MARTHA>Adios, dear. Have fun.

1087
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,580
<36-15,MARTHA>再见  玛莎
<36-15,MARTHA>Martha.

1088
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,810
<36-16,MEREDITH>这几天真是...  糟糕
<36-16,MEREDITH>Well, this has been... oh, shoot.

1089
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,100
<36-16,MEREDITH>我把皮包落在楼上了  帮帮忙吧
<36-16,MEREDITH>I left my purse upstairs. Be a dear.

1090
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,120
<36-17,CASTLE>我去拿
<36-17,CASTLE>I'll grab it.

1091
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,760
<36-18,MEREDITH>贝克特探长  认识你真是太开心了
<36-18,MEREDITH>Detective Beckett, it was a real pleasure.

1092
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,060
<36-19,BECKETT>是  的确是的
<36-19,BECKETT>Yes, it really was.

1093
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,320
<36-19,BECKETT>知道吗  梅瑞狄斯  说来好笑
<36-19,BECKETT>You know, Meredith, it's so funny.

1094
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,030
<36-19,BECKETT>当你最初过来坚持住在这里时
<36-19,BECKETT>When you first came and insisted on staying here,

1095
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,640
<36-19,BECKETT>我还担心你是不是有什么不可告人的目的
<36-19,BECKETT>I was afraid that you might have had a secret agenda.

1096
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,390
<36-20,MEREDITH>事实上  我有
<36-20,MEREDITH>Actually, I did.

1097
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,270
<36-20,MEREDITH>阿丽克西斯告诉了我你俩的事
<36-20,MEREDITH>When Alexis told me about you two

1098
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,110
<36-20,MEREDITH>以及你们是来真的
<36-20,MEREDITH>and how this one was serious,

1099
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,320
<36-20,MEREDITH>我就想着要自己来证实一下
<36-20,MEREDITH>I knew I had to check it out for myself.

1100
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,170
<36-20,MEREDITH>我很高兴我这样做了
<36-20,MEREDITH>And I'm so glad I did.

1101
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,370
<36-20,MEREDITH>你们真是天造地设的一对
<36-20,MEREDITH>You two are great together.

1102
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,690
<36-20,MEREDITH>谢谢
<36-20,MEREDITH>Thank you.

1103
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,550
<36-21,BECKETT>我可以问个问题吗
<36-21,BECKETT>Can I ask you a question?

1104
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,920
<36-21,BECKETT>你和里克为什么会分手
<36-21,BECKETT>Why didn't it work out between you and Rick?

1105
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,650
<36-21,BECKETT>抱歉
<36-21,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

1106
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,630
<36-22,BECKETT>这个问题太隐私了
<36-22,BECKETT>Is that too personal?

1107
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,830
<36-22,BECKETT>不不  没事
<36-22,BECKETT>Oh, no, no, no. It's fine.

1108
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,830
<36-23,MEREDITH>和理查德的婚姻生活是很幸福的
<36-23,MEREDITH>You know, being married to Richard was great--

1109
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,630
<36-23,MEREDITH>浪漫与刺激不断
<36-23,MEREDITH>Full of romance and excitement,

1110
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,110
<36-23,MEREDITH>感觉如同可口的蛋奶酥
<36-23,MEREDITH>Like a deliciously sweet souffle.

1111
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,160
<36-23,MEREDITH>然而有一天  我意识到  他了解了我的一切
<36-23,MEREDITH>And then one day, I realized, he knew everything about me--

1112
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,790
<36-23,MEREDITH>我最隐私的秘密  我最不可告人的伤痛
<36-23,MEREDITH>My deepest secrets, my worst pain--

1113
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,390
<36-23,MEREDITH>了解到足以写无数小说
<36-23,MEREDITH>Enough to fill a million novels.

1114
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,650
<36-23,MEREDITH>而我对他的了解
<36-23,MEREDITH>But I didn't know enough about him

1115
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,800
<36-23,MEREDITH>连本小册子都写不出来
<36-23,MEREDITH>to even write a pamphlet.

1116
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,620
<36-24,BECKETT>我不明白
<36-24,BECKETT>I don't understand.

1117
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,800
<36-25,MEREDITH>比如说  每次我问他
<36-25,MEREDITH>For instance, whenever I asked him about

1118
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,950
<36-25,MEREDITH>从来不知道自己父亲是谁有何感受
<36-25,MEREDITH>how he felt about never knowing his father,

1119
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,140
<36-25,MEREDITH>他就会假笑
<36-25,MEREDITH>He would smirk.

1120
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,200
<36-25,MEREDITH>你也知道他假笑的样子
<36-25,MEREDITH>You know the way he smirks.

1121
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,160
<36-25,MEREDITH>然后他就会说句俏皮话
<36-25,MEREDITH>And then he would throw out a quip

1122
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,670
<36-25,MEREDITH>改变话题
<36-25,MEREDITH>and change the subject.

1123
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,710
<36-25,MEREDITH>我们的婚姻有不足  而我不愿意将就
<36-25,MEREDITH>Our marriage went one way, and that wasn't enough for me.

1124
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,960
<36-25,MEREDITH>我意思是
<36-25,MEREDITH>I mean...

1125
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,670
<36-25,MEREDITH>蛋奶酥很美味
<36-25,MEREDITH>Souffles are wonderful,

1126
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,370
<36-25,MEREDITH>但顶上那层塌下来是迟早的事
<36-25,MEREDITH>but sooner or later, they always fall.

1127
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,390
<36-26,MEREDITH>但那是很久以前的事了
<36-26,MEREDITH>Oh, but that was a long, long time ago.

1128
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,390
<36-26,MEREDITH>应该有15年了吧
<36-26,MEREDITH>Wh-what? 15 years in fact.

1129
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,490
<36-26,MEREDITH>他现在完全不同了
<36-26,MEREDITH>He's a totally different man now.

1130
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,170
<36-27,BECKETT>当然了
<36-27,BECKETT>Yes, of course.

1131
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,830
<36-27,BECKETT>我只是好奇问下
<36-27,BECKETT>I was just curious.

1132
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,780
<36-28,CASTLE>好了  拿来了
<36-28,CASTLE>Okay. Here we go.

1133
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,700
<36-29,MEREDITH>你最好了  里克  谢谢
<36-29,MEREDITH>Oh, you are the best, Rick. Thank you.

1134
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,310
<36-29,MEREDITH>那是自然
<36-29,MEREDITH>You bet.

1135
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,250
<36-30,MEREDITH>希望可以再见到你
<36-30,MEREDITH>I hope we see each other again.

1136
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,710
<36-31,BECKETT>我也希望  梅瑞德斯  旅行愉快
<36-31,BECKETT>Oh, me, too, Meredith. Have a wonderful trip.

1137
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,370
<36-32,CASTLE>再见  里克
<36-32,CASTLE>Good-bye, Rick.

1138
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,510
<36-32,CASTLE>拜
<36-32,CASTLE>Bye.

1139
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,510
<36-33,CASTLE>在你走之前  我给你做早餐吧
<36-33,CASTLE>How about I make you a little breakfast before you leave?

1140
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,750
<36-34,CASTLE>我很快给你做个早全餐
<36-34,CASTLE>I'm gonna whip you up a smor-let.

1141
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,390
<36-34,CASTLE>听着比尝起来感觉好
<36-34,CASTLE>It sounds better than it tastes.

1142
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,980
<36-34,CASTLE>等等  不对  应该是尝起来比听着感觉好
<36-34,CASTLE>Wait, that's--no. It's the other way around.
