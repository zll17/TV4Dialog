00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,450
<1-44,MARTHA>我们家阿丽克西斯是个模范生
<1-44,MARTHA>that our Alexis is a paragon of--

105
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,660
<1-44,MARTHA>她优雅机智  成熟
<1-44,MARTHA>Of grace and good sense and maturity,

106
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,480
<1-44,MARTHA>虽然这些优秀品质是遗传谁的  我不知道
<1-44,MARTHA>although where she got those qualities, I do not know.

107
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,690
<1-44,MARTHA>是啊
<1-44,MARTHA>Right.

108
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,470
<1-45,CASTLE>如果我穿上衣服的话
<1-45,CASTLE>I would just be so much more comfortable

109
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,550
<1-45,CASTLE>谈论这个话题会更自在些
<1-45,CASTLE>having this conversation with my clothes on.

110
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,640
<1-46,MARTHA>好的
<1-46,MARTHA>Well, yes.

<1-47,CASTLE>"我们"  阿丽克西斯也回来了吗
<1-47,CASTLE>"We"? Alexis is here, too?

113
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,010
<2-1,MARTHA>喝点茶怎么样
<2-1,MARTHA>How about some tea?

114
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,590
<2-1,MARTHA>茶可以解解酒
<2-1,MARTHA>Tea can be very soothing.

115
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,470
<2-2,ALEXIS>不想喝
<2-2,ALEXIS>Oh, no. No tea.

116
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,540
<2-3,MARTHA>不喝茶
<2-3,MARTHA>No tea.

117
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,210
<2-5,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  你是宿醉了吗
<2-5,CASTLE>Alexis, are you hungover?

118
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,280
<2-6,MARTHA>毕业晚会上大家都玩疯了
<2-6,MARTHA>Well, the graduation festivities got a tad out of hand,

119
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,620
<2-6,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯给我打了电话
<2-6,MARTHA>and Alexis called me from the party.

120
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,060
<2-6,MARTHA>我开车到城里接的她
<2-6,MARTHA>I drove into town, I picked her up.

121
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,300
<2-6,MARTHA>拜托不要生气  亲爱的
<2-6,MARTHA>So please don't get angry, darling.

122
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
<2-7,CASTLE>你怎么不打给我
<2-7,CASTLE>Well, why didn't you call me?

123
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,670
<2-8,ALEXIS>我打了  你没接
<2-8,ALEXIS>I tried. You didn't pick up.

124
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,640
<2-8,ALEXIS>对哦
<2-8,ALEXIS>Right.

125
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,290
<2-9,CASTLE>是我的错
<2-9,CASTLE>And... that's on me.

126
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,460
<2-9,CASTLE>是我不好
<2-9,CASTLE>That's my bad.

127
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,380
<2-10,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  作为你的父亲
<2-10,CASTLE>Well, Alexis, as your father,

128
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,430
<2-10,CASTLE>我得说  我...
<2-10,CASTLE>I have to say, that I am...

129
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,590
<2-10,CASTLE>对你非常失望  但奇怪的是  也很自豪
<2-10,CASTLE>deeply disappointed in you, and yet, oddly proud.

130
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,610
<2-11,ALEXIS>我脑袋快炸了
<2-11,ALEXIS>Oh, my head is pounding.

131
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,740
<2-12,MARTHA>亲爱的  我去给你拿阿司匹林
<2-12,MARTHA>Oh, honey, I'll get you a couple of aspirin.

132
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,880
<2-12,MARTHA>不行
<2-12,MARTHA>Oh, no!

133
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,870
<2-13,CASTLE>不能吃阿司匹林
<2-13,CASTLE>No aspirin.

134
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,690
<2-14,MARTHA>什么意思  为什么不行
<2-14,MARTHA>What do you mean? Why not?

135
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,670
<2-15,CASTLE>这是她第一次宿醉
<2-15,CASTLE>It's her first hangover.

136
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,320
<2-15,CASTLE>这是座里程碑  是必经之路
<2-15,CASTLE>I mean, this is a milestone. It's a right of passage.

137
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,910
<2-15,CASTLE>你不想认真地体验一下这种感觉
<2-15,CASTLE>Don't you want to experience this in its--

138
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,170
<2-15,CASTLE>毫无缓解地  真实贴切地  而不靠那些
<2-15,CASTLE>in its fullness, un-- untrammeled by the--the relief

139
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,400
<2-15,CASTLE>非处方止痛药减轻症状吗
<2-15,CASTLE>of over-the counter pain relievers?

140
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,290
<2-16,ALEXIS>不想
<2-16,ALEXIS>No.

141
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,800
<2-17,CASTLE>不吗  好吧  去吃阿司匹林吧宝贝  抱歉
<2-17,CASTLE>No. Okay. Aspirin it is, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

142
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,230
<3-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>那么  枪击贝克特的嫌犯有何进展
<3-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>So... Any progress on Beckett's shooter?

143
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,440
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>我们搜查了他租的车
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>We searched his rental car.

144
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,030
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>还是不知道他当时的目的地
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>We still have no idea where he was going

145
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,470
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>以及他的真名
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>or even what his real name was.

146
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,760
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>但我们发现了他从蒙哥马利警监那里偷走的物品
<3-2,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>But we did find out what he stole from Captain Montgomery's house.

147
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,530
<3-3,GATES>蒙哥马利的结婚相册
<3-3,GATES>The Montgomerys' wedding album?

148
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,970
<3-3,GATES>马多克斯要这个做什么
<3-3,GATES>Why did Maddox want this?

149
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,650
<3-4,RYAN>我的猜测是  他想要这张失踪的相片
<3-4,RYAN>I'm guessing he wanted this missing photograph.

150
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,000
<3-4,RYAN>有可能相片中的人就是他的追踪目标
<3-4,RYAN>It's possible he was after whoever was in it.

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
<3-5,GATES>你查到是谁了吗
<3-5,GATES>Have you been able to track it down?

152
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,810
<3-6,RYAN>我让伊芙琳·蒙哥马利把底片带来了
<3-6,RYAN>Well, I've got Evelyn Montgomery bringing the negatives in.

153
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,150
<3-6,RYAN>但事实是  现在队里就我一个人
<3-6,RYAN>But truth is, I'm a one-man band here.

154
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,730
<3-6,RYAN>人手紧缺啊
<3-6,RYAN>I could use a few more investigators.

155
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,690
<3-7,GATES>你可以找副总统要人
<3-7,GATES>Well, you can take it up with the vice president.

156
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,570
<3-7,GATES>我已经派了一半的人去给他做安保
<3-7,GATES>I've already lost half my people to his security detail...

157
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,570
<3-7,GATES>另一半又要浪费在交通管制上了
<3-7,GATES>and about to lose the rest to traffic control.

158
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,290
<3-7,GATES>因此现在  你只能独挑大梁了
<3-7,GATES>So for right now, you're on your own.

159
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,390
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>你这是在白白找罪受  史密斯先生
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>You're putting yourself through this for nothing, Mr. Smith.

160
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,860
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>我们都知道结局会如何
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>We both know how it will end.

161
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,650
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>别逼我用更毒辣的手段逼供你
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>Don't make me take this to the next level.

162
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,380
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>告诉我文件在哪
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>Tell me where the file is.

163
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,270
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>去死吧
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>Go to hell.

164
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,920
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>你过来是为让我藏在衣柜里那事道歉的吗
<4-1,COLE MADDOX>So you here to apologize for hiding me in your closet?

165
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,290
<5-1,BECKETT>听我解释
<5-1,BECKETT>Look, let me explain.

166
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,870
<5-2,CASTLE>我听到她的声音时
<5-2,CASTLE>When I heard her voice,

167
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,720
<5-2,CASTLE>完全是触发了本能反应
<5-2,CASTLE>I reacted by instinct.

168
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,550
<5-3,BECKETT>是啊  就像纯情高中生般的本能反应
<5-3,BECKETT>Yeah, like the instinct of a sophomore in high school.

169
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,500
<5-4,CASTLE>没错
<5-4,CASTLE>Right.

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,320
<5-5,CASTLE>不  听着
<5-5,CASTLE>No. Look, I--

171
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,970
<5-6,BECKETT>等一下
<5-6,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

172
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,830
<5-6,BECKETT>你是羞于让人家看见你和我在一起
<5-6,BECKETT>You're embarrassed about being seen with me.

173
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,480
<5-7,CASTLE>不是那么回事
<5-7,CASTLE>Now that is not true.

174
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,010
<5-7,CASTLE>听着  我  这个  我
<5-7,CASTLE>Look, I--this--I--

175
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,710
<5-7,CASTLE>好吧  我还在适应我们的关系
<5-7,CASTLE>Okay... this is all just still very new to me,

176
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,960
<5-7,CASTLE>说我自私也好
<5-7,CASTLE>and call me selfish,

177
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,130
<5-7,CASTLE>我只是希望我们的关系
<5-7,CASTLE>but I want to keep what we have together

178
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,480
<5-7,CASTLE>暂时处于保密阶段
<5-7,CASTLE>to ourselves a bit longer.

179
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,100
<5-8,BECKETT>反正  那算不上你的最佳表现时刻哈
<5-8,BECKETT>Still, it wasn't your finest hour.

180
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,030
<5-8,BECKETT>不算
<5-8,BECKETT>No.

181
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,870
<5-9,CASTLE>或许我可以
<5-9,CASTLE>But maybe I could...

182
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,570
<5-9,CASTLE>做点事情补偿你一下
<5-9,CASTLE>make it up to you... somehow.

183
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,690
<5-10,BECKETT>既然你妈妈这次不会再搞突然袭击了
<5-10,BECKETT>I suppose since we know that your mom's not gonna be barging in,

184
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,740
<5-10,BECKETT>我们可以来第二轮
<5-10,BECKETT>we could go for round two.

185
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,720
<5-11,CASTLE>严格说来  应该是第四轮了
<5-11,CASTLE>Well, technically, it would be round four, but--

186
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,850
<5-12,CASTLE>她在跟踪我们  她知道了
<5-12,CASTLE>She's stalking us. She knows.

187
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,710
<5-13,BECKETT>是谁
<5-13,BECKETT>Who is it?

188
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,210
<5-14,RYAN>贝克特  我是莱恩
<5-14,RYAN>Beckett, it's Ryan.

189
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,750
<5-14,RYAN>藏起来
<5-14,RYAN>Hide.

190
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,850
<5-15,BECKETT>快点  到那边衣柜里去
<5-15,BECKETT>Quick. In the closet over there.

191
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,000
<5-16,CASTLE>是啊  我才不去
<5-16,CASTLE>Yeah, I'm not getting in there.

192
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,540
<5-17,BECKETT>为什么  我都躲进你的衣柜  你怎么就不行
<5-17,BECKETT>Why? I hid in your closet. Why can't you hide in mine?

193
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,620
<5-18,CASTLE>-我为什么要躲  -因为
<5-18,CASTLE>- Why should I? - Because--

194
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,660
<5-20,RYAN>-贝克特  你没事吧  -没事
<5-20,RYAN>- Beckett, is everything okay? - Fine.

195
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,180
<5-21,BECKETT>我也没准备好让大家都知道
<5-21,BECKETT>Okay, maybe I'm not ready for anyone to know yet...

196
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,510
<5-21,BECKETT>快去
<5-21,BECKETT>Right now.

197
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,450
<5-22,CASTLE>拜托  他怎么会知道
<5-22,CASTLE>Come on. How's he gonna know?

198
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,160
<5-23,BECKETT>你在我家  就像我在你家一样
<5-23,BECKETT>You're here, just like I was there.

199
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,830
<5-24,CASTLE>是的  是的  但不同的是
<5-24,CASTLE>Yes, yes, the difference being,

200
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,280
<5-24,CASTLE>我现在是穿着裤子的
<5-24,CASTLE>I have my pants on.

201
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,240
<5-24,CASTLE>或者说  你羞于让别人见到我们在一起
<5-24,CASTLE>Or... or are you embarrassed to be seen with me?

202
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,050
<5-25,BECKETT>好的
<5-25,BECKETT>Okay. Fine.

203
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,060
<5-25,BECKETT>表现得正常一点
<5-25,BECKETT>Just act normal...

204
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
<5-25,BECKETT>虽然那对你来说不大可能
<5-25,BECKETT>if that's even possible for you.

205
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,870
<5-26,CASTLE>那就是我的风格
<5-26,CASTLE>It's me.

206
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,440
<5-27,RYAN>嘿  卡塞尔
<5-27,RYAN>Hey, Castle.

207
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,590
<5-27,RYAN>你在这里做什么
<5-27,RYAN>What are you doing here?

208
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,260
<5-28,CASTLE>我正好经过
<5-28,CASTLE>Well, I was just walking by

209
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,100
<5-28,CASTLE>附近  街区
<5-28,CASTLE>The neighbor... hood.

210
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,770
<5-28,CASTLE>我家离这里20...
<5-28,CASTLE>I only live 20...

211
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,930
<5-28,CASTLE>你来干什么
<5-28,CASTLE>Uh, what are you doing here?

212
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,430
<5-29,RYAN>我要和你们谈谈案子的事
<5-29,RYAN>I need to talk to you about the case.

213
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
<5-30,BECKETT>莱恩
<5-30,BECKETT>Uh, Ryan.

214
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
<5-30,BECKETT>不  莱恩
<5-30,BECKETT>Uh, no, Ryan.

215
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,500
<5-30,BECKETT>我辞职了  我不干了
<5-30,BECKETT>I've resigned. I'm done.

216
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,410
<5-30,BECKETT>听着
<5-30,BECKETT>Look...

217
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,560
<5-31,RYAN>我希望这不是因为盖茨
<5-31,RYAN>I hope this isn't because of Gates

218
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,040
<5-31,RYAN>或是我的所为
<5-31,RYAN>or... because of what I did.

219
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,800
<5-32,BECKETT>不不  听着  我理解的
<5-32,BECKETT>No. No, look, I get it.

220
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,430
<5-32,BECKETT>你当时只是想保护我们
<5-32,BECKETT>You were just trying to keep us safe.

221
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,590
<5-33,RYAN>我现在也是
<5-33,RYAN>I still am.

222
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,430
<5-33,RYAN>那个把你扔下屋顶的人
<5-33,RYAN>And this guy that threw you off the roof,

223
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,130
<5-33,RYAN>他仍逍遥法外
<5-33,RYAN>He's still out there.

224
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,220
<5-34,CASTLE>莱恩
<5-34,CASTLE>Ryan--

225
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,970
<5-35,RYAN>我知道这个案子对你造成的种种伤害
<5-35,RYAN>I know what this case has done to you.

226
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,730
<5-35,RYAN>我不是让你重新跳回火坑
<5-35,RYAN>I'm not asking you to jump back in.

227
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,090
<5-35,RYAN>我只想让你看看一些东西  仅此而已
<5-35,RYAN>I just want to show you something. That's all.

228
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,870
<5-36,RYAN>我们找到了马多克斯从婚礼相册拿走的照片副本
<5-36,RYAN>We found a copy of the photo Maddox took From the wedding album.

229
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,680
<5-36,RYAN>你对以前和罗伊一起工作的人都很熟悉
<5-36,RYAN>You're familiar with the guys that Roy ran with back in the day.

230
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,440
<5-36,RYAN>他是其中的一员吗
<5-36,RYAN>Is he one of them?

231
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,850
<5-37,BECKETT>我之前从没见过他
<5-37,BECKETT>I've never seen him before.

232
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,310
<5-37,BECKETT>我见过
<5-37,BECKETT>I have.

233
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,200
<5-38,CASTLE>他就是我和你说过的那个保证你安全的人
<5-38,CASTLE>This is the man I told you about, the one who's been keeping you safe.

234
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,000
<5-39,BECKETT>你确定吗
<5-39,BECKETT>Are you sure?

235
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,050
<5-40,CASTLE>他现在变老了  但绝对是他
<5-40,CASTLE>He's older now, but it's definitely him.

236
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,380
<5-41,RYAN>我们  现在到底在说什么
<5-41,RYAN>What--what are we talking about here?

237
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,950
<5-42,CASTLE>不管蒙哥马利给了他什么信息
<5-42,CASTLE>Whatever information Montgomery gave to him,

238
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,950
<5-42,CASTLE>他一直用它来保护你
<5-42,CASTLE>He's been using it to protect you.

239
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,740
<5-42,CASTLE>但现在他们派了
<5-42,CASTLE>But now they've sent...

240
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,320
<5-42,CASTLE>马多克斯追查他  并把信息抢回来
<5-42,CASTLE>Maddox to hunt him down and get it back.

241
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,970
<5-42,CASTLE>如果我们不抢在马多克斯之前找到他
<5-42,CASTLE>If we don't get to him before Maddox does,

242
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,580
<5-42,CASTLE>你就永远别想安全了
<5-42,CASTLE>you'll never be safe again.

252
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,470
<6-1,RYAN>马多克斯要找的这个人
<6-1,RYAN>This guy who Maddox is looking for,

253
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,470
<6-1,RYAN>就是问题的关键
<6-1,RYAN>he's the key.

254
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,520
<6-1,RYAN>找到他  就能找到蒙哥马利的文件
<6-1,RYAN>We find him, we find Montgomery's file.

255
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,170
<6-2,CASTLE>也就能找到这一切的幕后黑手
<6-2,CASTLE>Which could lead to who's behind this whole thing,

256
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,120
<6-2,CASTLE>包括你妈妈的被害案
<6-2,CASTLE>including your mother's murder.

257
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,770
<6-3,RYAN>你们交谈过那么多次
<6-3,RYAN>And all the times you talked,

258
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,620
<6-3,RYAN>他从没透露过自己的名字吗  假名也算啊
<6-3,RYAN>He never gave you a name, even a fake one?

259
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,240
<6-5,RYAN>-没  -那他工作的地方呢
<6-5,RYAN>- No. - Or where he worked?

260
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,070
<6-5,RYAN>-没  -家庭住址
<6-5,RYAN>- No. - Where he lived?

261
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,170
<6-6,CASTLE>没有  这类信息从来没有
<6-6,CASTLE>No, nothing like that.

262
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,700
<6-6,CASTLE>他打过我手机
<6-6,CASTLE>He, um, he called my cell phone.

263
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,060
<6-6,CASTLE>就在两天之前
<6-6,CASTLE>Uh, two nights ago. Uh, uh...

264
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,850
<6-6,CASTLE>但号码是屏蔽的
<6-6,CASTLE>But from a blocked number.

265
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,760
<6-7,RYAN>我去查你的通话记录
<6-7,RYAN>I'll run your phone records,

266
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
<6-7,RYAN>看看我能不能查到他的号码
<6-7,RYAN>See if I can trace the number that he called from.

267
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,510
<6-8,BECKETT>一切该就此结束了才对
<6-8,BECKETT>This was supposed to be over.

268
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,640
<6-8,BECKETT>我不能再陷进去了  现在不能
<6-8,BECKETT>I can't go back again. Not now.

269
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,080
<6-9,CASTLE>但现在我们别无选择
<6-9,CASTLE>Well, now we don't have a choice.

270
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,670
<6-9,CASTLE>如果马多克斯比我们先找到他
<6-9,CASTLE>If Maddox gets to him before we do--

271
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,290
<6-10,BECKETT>但是我不知道怎么做
<6-10,BECKETT>But I don't know how to do this.

272
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,620
<6-10,BECKETT>我现在连警察都不是了
<6-10,BECKETT>I'm not even a cop anymore.

273
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,790
<6-11,CASTLE>我来告诉你我们怎么做
<6-11,CASTLE>I'll tell you exactly what we do.

274
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,880
<6-11,CASTLE>我们查出他是谁
<6-11,CASTLE>We figure out who this is.

275
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,560
<6-11,CASTLE>我们以前也做过的  线索甚至更少
<6-11,CASTLE>We've done it before, and with less to go on.

276
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,550
<6-11,CASTLE>等我们做到了  我们让这一切都结束
<6-11,CASTLE>And when we do, we lay all of this to rest,

277
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,310
<6-11,CASTLE>然后我们再回到以前
<6-11,CASTLE>And we go back to where we were.

278
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,880
<6-11,CASTLE>你很擅长这个的
<6-11,CASTLE>This is what you're great at.

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,080
<6-11,CASTLE>不过我在这方面也不差
<6-11,CASTLE>And I'm not so bad myself.

280
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
<6-11,CASTLE>所以
<6-11,CASTLE>So...

281
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,040
<6-11,CASTLE>我们有什么线索
<6-11,CASTLE>What do we know?

282
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,290
<6-11,CASTLE>我们知道这个人约60多岁  长住纽约
<6-11,CASTLE>We know this guy is about 60, he's a long-time new yorker,

283
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,690
<6-11,CASTLE>是蒙哥马利的朋友
<6-11,CASTLE>Uh, friends with Montgomery,

284
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,900
<6-11,CASTLE>所以他可能与执法机构有联系
<6-11,CASTLE>So he may have connections to law enforcement.

285
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,550
<6-12,BECKETT>他
<6-12,BECKETT>He, um...

286
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,770
<6-12,BECKETT>他看起来身份显赫
<6-12,BECKETT>He seems prominent,

287
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,560
<6-12,BECKETT>富有
<6-12,BECKETT>wealthy.

288
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,820
<6-12,BECKETT>对
<6-12,BECKETT>That's right.

289
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,130
<6-13,CASTLE>而且他在拍照的时候  就已经权财兼备了
<6-13,CASTLE>And he has been that way ever since this photo was taken.

290
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,840
<6-14,BECKETT>你是怎么知道的
<6-14,BECKETT>How do you know that?

291
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,010
<6-15,CASTLE>看他的手表
<6-15,CASTLE>Look at his wrist.

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,530
<6-15,CASTLE>那是百达翡丽3800
<6-15,CASTLE>That's a Nautilus 3800.

293
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,180
<6-15,CASTLE>1981年问世的时候就卖一万美元
<6-15,CASTLE>It was 10 grand when it came out in 1981.

294
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,360
<6-15,CASTLE>而且
<6-15,CASTLE>And...

295
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,650
<6-15,CASTLE>蒙哥马利正是在那年结婚的  1981年五月
<6-15,CASTLE>That's the year Montgomery was married--May of 1981.

296
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,530
<6-15,CASTLE>这样的手表在五个月里
<6-15,CASTLE>How many of these watches

297
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,220
<6-15,CASTLE>能卖出去多少呢
<6-15,CASTLE>could possibly have been sold in five months?

298
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,260
<7-1,STAFF SERGEANT CASS>哈维尔  你吩咐的事我不能做
<7-1,STAFF SERGEANT CASS>Javi, I can't do what you're asking.

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,780
<7-2,ESPOSITO>我可是曾为你挨过一枪  卡斯
<7-2,ESPOSITO>I took a bullet for you, Cass.

300
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,730
<7-2,ESPOSITO>你忘了吗
<7-2,ESPOSITO>You forget that?

<7-3,CASS>我不能在没有授权的情况下
<7-3,CASS>I can't tap into the D.O.D. database

302
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,060
<7-3,CASS>进入国防部的数据库
<7-3,CASS>without authorization.

303
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,390
<7-3,CASS>我会失去一切的  兄弟
<7-3,CASS>I'll lose everything, man.

304
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,570
<7-4,ESPOSITO>前提是你被发现
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Only if you get caught.

305
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,370
<7-4,ESPOSITO>但你不会被发现的
<7-4,ESPOSITO>And you won't.

306
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,490
<7-4,ESPOSITO>我用现金从一个资产清算人那里买来的
<7-4,ESPOSITO>I bought this from a liquidator, cash.

307
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,940
<7-4,ESPOSITO>我们一完成  我就格掉硬盘
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Soon as we're done, I'll wipe the drive,

308
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,120
<7-4,ESPOSITO>扔掉盒子  永远反查不到你身上
<7-4,ESPOSITO>ditch the box. It'll never come back to you.

309
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,820
<7-4,ESPOSITO>他以前是军人
<7-4,ESPOSITO>He's former army.

310
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,600
<7-4,ESPOSITO>特种部队  三角洲特种队  我也不知道
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Special forces, Delta-- I don't know.

311
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,650
<7-4,ESPOSITO>他射伤了我的朋友  差点杀死了她
<7-4,ESPOSITO>This guy shot a friend of mine, almost killed her.

312
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,340
<7-4,ESPOSITO>如果不阻止他  他是不会就此罢手的
<7-4,ESPOSITO>He's gonna keep coming unless he's stopped.

313
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,330
<7-4,ESPOSITO>我必须知道他的身份
<7-4,ESPOSITO>I need to I.D. Him.

314
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,320
<7-4,ESPOSITO>你得帮我
<7-4,ESPOSITO>You need to help me.

315
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,380
<8-1,CASTLE>好的  嗯  谢谢
<8-1,CASTLE>Okay. Yes. Thank you.

316
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,180
<8-2,CASTLE>好吧  手表公司说1981年一月到五月期间
<8-2,CASTLE>All right, the watch company says that 17 of the 3800s...

317
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,790
<8-2,CASTLE>在纽约卖掉17块3800S手表
<8-2,CASTLE>were sold in New York in 1981 between January and May.

318
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,710
<8-3,BECKETT>他们有没有把这17个人的名字告诉你
<8-3,BECKETT>And did they give you names of any of these clients?

319
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,430
<8-4,CASTLE>没有  不过17块表里面
<8-4,CASTLE>No, but 9 of the 17 watches

320
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,470
<8-4,CASTLE>有9块是作为礼物送给一家隶属
<8-4,CASTLE>were given as gifts to a legal team

321
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,300
<8-4,CASTLE>PPC法律事务所的律师团
<8-4,CASTLE>at the law firm of P.P.C.

322
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,420
<8-4,CASTLE>因为他们刚赢了一起针对烟草巨头的民事诉讼
<8-4,CASTLE>after they won a civil suit against big tobacco.

323
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,380
<8-5,BECKETT>这样的民事诉讼肯定会有大量媒体报道
<8-5,BECKETT>Winning a tobacco lawsuit would get a lot of publicity.

324
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,300
<8-6,CASTLE>运气好的话我们甚至能
<8-6,CASTLE>With any luck, we'll I.D.

325
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,410
<8-6,CASTLE>在莱恩追查电话之前找到此人
<8-6,CASTLE>this guy before ryan even traces that call.

326
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,980
<8-6,CASTLE>什么叫你没法查到这个电话
<8-6,CASTLE>What do you mean you can't trace the call?

327
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,090
<9-1,RYAN>为什么不行
<9-1,RYAN>Why the hell not?

328
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,860
<9-1,RYAN>我这边时间很紧
<9-1,RYAN>Look, I'm on the clock here.

329
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,660
<9-1,RYAN>必须马上知道是谁打的电话
<9-1,RYAN>I need to know who made that call. Now.

330
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,640
<9-1,RYAN>可  好吧  好吧  让霍本警官来接
<9-1,RYAN>But--yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just put officer Hoben on.

331
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,160
<9-1,RYAN>我平时都是找他
<9-1,RYAN>He's the guy I usually deal with over there.

332
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,980
<9-1,RYAN>这就是打赢官司的PPC律师团
<9-1,RYAN>Okay, so this is the P.P.C. Legal team that won the suit,

333
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,650
<10-1,BECKETT>可是  他不在这上面
<10-1,BECKETT>but I...Don't see him.

334
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,130
<10-2,CASTLE>那是个9人团队
<10-2,CASTLE>It was a 9-man team.

335
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,750
<10-2,CASTLE>照片上只有8个  没来的那个应该就是他
<10-2,CASTLE>There's only eight here. He must be the missing lawyer.

336
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,520
<10-3,BECKETT>也有可能他根本就不是律师
<10-3,BECKETT>Or he's not a lawyer at all.

337
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,560
<10-4,CASTLE>或者他确实是律师  不过他...
<10-4,CASTLE>Or he is a lawyer, but he operates...

338
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,090
<10-4,CASTLE>是在背后出力的那种
<10-4,CASTLE>behind the scenes.

339
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,270
<10-4,CASTLE>他可能是
<10-4,CASTLE>He would be, um,

340
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,060
<10-4,CASTLE>"高级顾问"  就像迈克尔·克雷顿一样
<10-4,CASTLE>"Of counsel," like Michael Clayton.

342
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,820
<10-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这张照片都是30年前的了
<10-5,BECKETT>Castle, this photo is 30 years old.

343
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,850
<10-5,BECKETT>没人知道这人是否还在这家公司
<10-5,BECKETT>We have no idea if this guy still works at that law firm

344
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,780
<10-5,BECKETT>甚至可能他当年也不是这家公司的
<10-5,BECKETT>or if he ever worked there at all.

345
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,780
<10-7,RYAN>-贝克特  -坏消息
<10-7,RYAN>- Beckett. - Bad news.

346
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,520
<10-7,RYAN>那家伙给卡塞尔打电话用的是一次性手机
<10-7,RYAN>The number the guy called Castle from came from a burner phone,

347
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,850
<10-7,RYAN>现在已经停用了
<10-7,RYAN>and it's out of service.

348
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,420
<10-7,RYAN>不管那人是谁  他在刻意隐藏行踪
<10-7,RYAN>Whoever this guy is, he covered his tracks.

349
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,660
<10-7,RYAN>我们已经通缉了马多克斯
<10-7,RYAN>Look, we put out alerts for Maddox.

350
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,540
<10-7,RYAN>照片已经发到全州去了
<10-7,RYAN>We circulated his photo all over the state.

351
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,190
<10-7,RYAN>总会有人看见他的
<10-7,RYAN>Someone will spot him.

352
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,780
<10-8,CASTLE>可一直等也不是个办法
<10-8,CASTLE>Well, we can't wait for that.

353
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,060
<10-8,CASTLE>你有没有查到什么
<10-8,CASTLE>Did you get anything?

354
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,370
<10-9,RYAN>倒是有一点线索  但能查到的希望不大
<10-9,RYAN>Well, there is one thing, but it's a long shot.

355
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,810
<10-9,RYAN>那家伙用的不是普通手机  而是网络电话
<10-9,RYAN>The guy used voice-over-internet instead of normal cell service,

356
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,420
<10-9,RYAN>他在一个信号很差的地方打了个电话
<10-9,RYAN>but he made a call in a bad signal area

357
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,320
<10-9,RYAN>是连接无线网之后拨打的
<10-9,RYAN>that got routed through a wireless network.

358
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,390
<10-10,CASTLE>如果真是通过网络  那一定就有IP地址
<10-10,CASTLE>Well, if it's a network, it'll have an I.P. Address.

359
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,670
<10-11,RYAN>没错  我们追查了IP
<10-11,RYAN>Yeah, and we traced it.

360
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,020
<10-11,RYAN>那个电话甚至都不是在纽约打的
<10-11,RYAN>Um, uh, it's not even in New York.

361
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,120
<10-12,BECKETT>-那是在哪儿  -这通电话
<10-12,BECKETT>- Then where is it? - The call

362
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,100
<10-13,RYAN>用的无线网络注册地在麦哲伦游艇俱乐部
<10-13,RYAN>went through a wireless network that's registered

363
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,290
<10-13,RYAN>位于康涅狄格州的韦斯特波特市
<10-13,RYAN>to the Magellan Yacht Club in Westport, Connecticut.

364
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,810
<10-14,BECKETT>谢了  莱恩
<10-14,BECKETT>Thanks, Ryan.

365
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,250
<10-15,CASTLE>他应该是俱乐部的会员
<10-15,CASTLE>He must be a member of this club.

366
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,270
<10-15,CASTLE>也许这个网站上会有他的照片
<10-15,CASTLE>Maybe there's a picture of him somewhere Posted on the site?

367
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,910
<10-15,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<10-15,CASTLE>Castle.

368
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,220
<10-16,BECKETT>看
<10-16,BECKETT>Look.

369
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,510
<10-16,BECKETT>高级顾问律师名单上有这个名字
<10-16,BECKETT>On the "Of counsel" Attorney list.

370
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,670
<10-16,BECKETT>再看董事会一栏
<10-16,BECKETT>Now look at the board of directors.

371
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,090
<10-17,CASTLE>迈克尔·史密斯  就是他
<10-17,CASTLE>Michael Smith. That's him.

372
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,920
<11-1,CASTLE>看来被马多克斯抢先一步
<11-1,CASTLE>Looks like Maddox found him first.

373
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,830
<11-2,BECKETT>文件
<11-2,BECKETT>The file.

374
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,720
<11-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<11-2,BECKETT>Castle.

375
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,640
<11-3,CASTLE>他还活着
<11-3,CASTLE>He's still alive.

376
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,750
<12-1,CASTLE>抱歉  听得见我说话吗
<12-1,CASTLE>Excuse me, can you hear me?

377
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,110
<12-2,EMT>先生  请你退后
<12-2,EMT>Sir, I'm asking you to step away.

378
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,760
<12-2,EMT>文件
<12-2,EMT>The file...

379
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,160
<12-3,SMITH>不安全
<12-3,SMITH>It's not safe.

380
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,800
<12-6,SMITH>86...
<12-6,SMITH>86...

381
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,560
<12-5,CASTLE>86  什么意思  什么86
<12-5,CASTLE>86? What does that mean? 86...

382
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,690
<12-5,CASTLE>-我不知道你在说什么  -86 马...
<12-5,CASTLE>- I don't know what that means. - 86 M--

383
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,810
<12-6,SMITH>先生  我们必须送他到急诊室
<12-6,SMITH>Sir, we need to get him to the E.R..

384
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,310
<12-7,CASTLE>我不懂  等等
<12-7,CASTLE>I don't understand. Wait.

385
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,200
<12-8,EMT>-不行  得马上走  -那是什么意思
<12-8,EMT>- No, we have to get him to the E.R.. - What does that mean?

386
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,770
<12-10,CASTLE>史密斯要能活下来
<12-10,CASTLE>If Smith makes it,

387
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,870
<12-11,BECKETT>恐怕莱恩要派人时刻保护他了
<12-11,BECKETT>Ryan's gonna put him under police guard,

388
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,470
<12-11,BECKETT>免得马多克斯又折回来
<12-11,BECKETT>Make sure that Maddox doesn't come back

389
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,660
<12-11,BECKETT>把他干掉
<12-11,BECKETT>and finish off the job.

390
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,310
<12-12,CASTLE>史密斯刚给了我一条线索  他说"86"
<12-12,CASTLE>Smith just gave me a message. He said "86."

391
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,190
<12-12,CASTLE>肯定跟文件有关
<12-12,CASTLE>It has to be a clue to where the file is.

392
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,040
<12-13,BECKETT>我们知道文件在哪啊  就在火堆里
<12-13,BECKETT>We know where the file is. It's right there.

393
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,160
<12-13,BECKETT>烧得只剩灰烬了
<12-13,BECKETT>It's burnt to a crisp.

394
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,080
<12-14,CASTLE>不  史密斯很聪明
<12-14,CASTLE>No, Smith is too smart

395
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,060
<12-14,CASTLE>不可能只留一份放在公寓里
<12-14,CASTLE>to only keep one copy in--in his apartment.

396
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,590
<12-14,CASTLE>他非常谨慎小心的  他...
<12-14,CASTLE>He's too careful for that. He's...

397
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,090
<12-14,CASTLE>那是个代码
<12-14,CASTLE>It's a code.

398
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,630
<13-2,CASTLE>答案一定就在这里什么地方
<13-2,CASTLE>The answer's here somewhere.

399
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,950
<13-1,BECKETT>我们得走了
<13-1,BECKETT>We need to go.

400
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,180
<13-2,CASTLE>答案一定就在这儿
<13-2,CASTLE>Well, the answer's got to be here.

401
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,360
<13-2,CASTLE>肯定在
<13-2,CASTLE>It's somewhere here.

402
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,920
<13-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这里没什么好找的了
<13-3,BECKETT>Castle, there's nothing left to find.

403
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,130
<13-3,BECKETT>86这个数字太宽泛
<13-3,BECKETT>86 could mean anything.

404
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,560
<13-3,BECKETT>你这完全就是在孤注一掷
<13-3,BECKETT>You're just grasping at straws.

405
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,420
<13-3,BECKETT>没错  我就是孤注一掷
<13-3,BECKETT>Yes, I'm grasping at straws,

406
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,930
<13-4,CASTLE>如果文件不见了
<13-4,CASTLE>Because if that file is gone,

407
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,870
<13-4,CASTLE>说明他们就要冲你来了
<13-4,CASTLE>that means they're coming after you,

408
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,440
<13-4,CASTLE>到时我就没办法保护你
<13-4,CASTLE>And there's absolutely nothing I can do.

409
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,620
<13-4,CASTLE>所以  没错  如果剩最后一根救命稻草
<13-4,CASTLE>So, yes, if there is a straw, I'm--

410
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,670
<13-4,CASTLE>我会紧抓着不放
<13-4,CASTLE>I'm grasping.

411
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,860
<13-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们甚至不该出现在这里
<13-5,BECKETT>Castle, we're not even supposed to be here.

412
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,110
<13-5,BECKETT>当警察到这里时
<13-5,BECKETT>When uniforms come here,

413
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,740
<13-5,BECKETT>他们会以私闯民宅罪逮捕我们的
<13-5,BECKETT>they're gonna arrest us for breaking and entering.

414
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,660
<13-5,BECKETT>我们快没时间了
<13-5,BECKETT>We're running out of time.

415
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,490
<13-6,CASTLE>史密斯在下曼哈顿区有处房产
<13-6,CASTLE>Smith owns property in Lower Manhattan.

416
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,050
<13-6,CASTLE>这个  马克威尔街86号
<13-6,CASTLE>This one-- 86 Markwell street.

417
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,310
<13-6,CASTLE>史密斯说的就是这个
<13-6,CASTLE>That's what Smith said.

418
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,150
<13-6,CASTLE>他说"86"  还有"马"音
<13-6,CASTLE>He said "86" and then "Ma-ma-ma,"

419
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,740
<13-6,CASTLE>像是一个M打头的单词
<13-6,CASTLE>Like something started with "M."

420
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,200
<13-6,CASTLE>文件就在这栋楼里
<13-6,CASTLE>This building, this is where the file is.

421
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,990
<14-1,CASTLE>好吧
<14-1,CASTLE>All right, so...

422
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,560
<14-1,CASTLE>这栋楼才十层
<14-1,CASTLE>The building is ten stories.

423
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,490
<14-1,CASTLE>找一份文件不会有多难  对吧
<14-1,CASTLE>How hard can it be to find a file, right?

424
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,750
<14-2,BECKETT>他肯定把它藏在
<14-2,BECKETT>He would've hid it in a place

425
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,460
<14-2,BECKETT>不会被拆迁人员发现的地方
<14-2,BECKETT>that was safe from the demolition crew.

426
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,890
<14-3,CASTLE>是的  也就是说史密斯先生
<14-3,CASTLE>Yes, which suggests that Mr. Smith

427
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,460
<14-3,CASTLE>不仅拥有这栋楼
<14-3,CASTLE>not only owns this building,

428
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,180
<14-3,CASTLE>还对楼的结构了如指掌
<14-3,CASTLE>but he knows it inside and out.

429
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,610
<14-4,BECKETT>谢了
<14-4,BECKETT>Thanks.

430
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,560
<14-5,CASTLE>谢什么  我们还没找到呢
<14-5,CASTLE>For what? We haven't found it yet.

431
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,990
<14-6,BECKETT>我知道  如果不是因为你
<14-6,BECKETT>Just I-I-I know I never would've gotten this far

432
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,130
<14-6,BECKETT>不可能查到这一步
<14-6,BECKETT>if it wasn't for you.

433
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,190
<14-7,CASTLE>你和我  我们会圆满解决这事的
<14-7,CASTLE>Hey, we're gonna get this done, you and me.

434
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,310
<14-7,CASTLE>我们先排除所有的内墙
<14-7,CASTLE>And we're gonna start by ruling out all the interior walls.

435
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,570
<14-7,CASTLE>史密斯不会冒险藏在那儿的
<14-7,CASTLE>Smith wouldn't risk hiding it there

436
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,220
<14-7,CASTLE>那些石膏板都会被拆掉的
<14-7,CASTLE>with all the sheetrock getting torn down.

437
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,570
<14-7,CASTLE>天花板也不可能
<14-7,CASTLE>Ceilings are no good either.

438
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,520
<14-7,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<14-7,CASTLE>Castle.

439
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,350
<14-8,BECKETT>迈克尔·史密斯  523室
<14-8,BECKETT>Michael Smith. 523.

440
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,930
<14-8,BECKETT>他不仅是整栋楼的所有者
<14-8,BECKETT>He didn't just own the building.

441
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,570
<14-9,CASTLE>他在五楼还有个办公室
<14-9,CASTLE>He had an office on the fifth floor.

442
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,970
<14-10,MADDOX>还真是有用的信息
<14-10,MADDOX>Well, that's some helpful information.

443
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,150
<14-10,MADDOX>转过身去  手背后面
<14-10,MADDOX>Turn around. Hands behind your back.

444
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,450
<14-11,MADDOX>你就是不懂何时该放弃  是吧
<14-11,MADDOX>You just don't know when to quit, do you?

445
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,070
<14-12,CASTLE>所以你说服史密斯告诉你文件所在
<14-12,CASTLE>So you convinced Smith to tell you where the file was.

446
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,160
<14-13,MADDOX>他说文件被安全地藏在某层楼里
<14-13,MADDOX>He told me it was hidden in a floor safe,

447
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,900
<14-13,MADDOX>但却不肯透露具体地址
<14-13,MADDOX>but he didn't tell me exactly where.

448
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,220
<14-13,MADDOX>幸运的是  你们替我想出来了
<14-13,MADDOX>Good thing you guys cleared that up.

449
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,460
<14-14,BECKETT>你没杀他是因为你怕找不到文件
<14-14,BECKETT>You didn't kill him in case you couldn't find the file.

450
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,870
<14-15,MADDOX>等我找到之后  我就能来算你这笔账了
<14-15,MADDOX>And once I do, I'm finally gonna settle our account.

451
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,920
<15-1,MADDOX>一会儿见
<15-1,MADDOX>See you soon.

452
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,340
<15-2,CASTLE>好吧  我们有一两分钟的时间离开这里
<15-2,CASTLE>Okay, we've got a minute, maybe two to get the hell out of here.

453
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,810
<15-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你的扣条有多紧
<15-3,BECKETT>Castle, how tight are your zip ties?

454
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,800
<15-3,BECKETT>-你的手能动吗  -不  只能一点点
<15-3,BECKETT>- Can you move your hands at all? - No, just barely.

455
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,340
<15-5,BECKETT>你的口袋里有什么锋利的东西吗
<15-5,BECKETT>Do you have anything sharp in your pocket...

456
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,790
<15-7,BECKETT>-没有  -比如小刀
<15-7,BECKETT>- Uh, no. - Like a knife,

457
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,260
<15-9,BECKETT>-指甲钳  -没有  谁会带指甲钳啊
<15-9,BECKETT>- nail clippers? - No. Who carries nail clippers?

458
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,910
<15-11,BECKETT>你有钥匙吗
<15-11,BECKETT>Do you have keys?

459
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,350
<15-12,CASTLE>没有  我家门是遥控的
<15-12,CASTLE>No, it's a fob. It's a remote.

460
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,070
<15-12,CASTLE>这  这里有个干壁钉  好极了
<15-12,CASTLE>There's--there's--there's a-a drywall screw. Perfect.

461
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,400
<15-13,BECKETT>那  那有什么用
<15-13,BECKETT>That's-- that's not gonna help.

462
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,560
<15-14,CASTLE>恕我不能赞同
<15-14,CASTLE>Ah, I beg to differ.

463
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,380
<15-14,CASTLE>我所要做的是  拿着扣条
<15-14,CASTLE>All I have to do is grab the zip tie

464
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,250
<15-14,CASTLE>用钉子把它锯断
<15-14,CASTLE>and... saw through.

465
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,430
<16-1,CASTLE>我连一点痕迹都没磨出来
<16-1,CASTLE>I am barely making a dent in this thing.

466
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,660
<16-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我听见脚步声了  他回来了
<16-2,BECKETT>Castle, I hear footsteps. He's coming.

467
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,630
<16-3,BECKETT>快点
<16-3,BECKETT>Hurry.

468
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,070
<16-4,CASTLE>如果现在被他杀了  我会觉得亏大了
<16-4,CASTLE>If we got murdered right now, I'd feel so ripped off.

469
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,770
<16-5,BECKETT>我也是
<16-5,BECKETT>Yeah, me too.

470
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,210
<16-6,CASTLE>至少
<16-6,CASTLE>At least...

471
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,310
<16-6,CASTLE>至少我们共度了昨晚
<16-6,CASTLE>At least we had last night.

472
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,130
<16-6,CASTLE>我们在4年前就该这么做了
<16-6,CASTLE>We should've done that four years ago.

473
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,620
<16-7,ESPOSITO>4年前该做什么
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Done what four years ago?

474
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,300
<17-1,ESPOSITO>马多克斯的真名叫塞德里克·马科斯
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Maddox's real name is Cedric Marks.

475
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,720
<17-1,ESPOSITO>他服完兵役之后
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Once he finished his tour,

476
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,990
<17-1,ESPOSITO>在阿兰特斯方案公司找了份工作
<17-1,ESPOSITO>he got a job at a place called Arantus Solutions,

477
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,100
<17-1,ESPOSITO>是一种雇佣兵军事承包商
<17-1,ESPOSITO>a kind of black-ops military contractor.

478
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,450
<17-2,CASTLE>你是怎么找到这里来的
<17-2,CASTLE>How'd all that lead you here?

479
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,010
<17-3,ESPOSITO>得到他的名字后  我就派人留意他的车
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Well, once I got his name, I put a bolo out on his car.

480
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:47,050
<17-3,ESPOSITO>一名警察在这栋楼外面发现了
<17-3,ESPOSITO>A uniform spotted it outside this building.

481
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,770
<17-3,ESPOSITO>等我过来核实时  就发现了你的车
<17-3,ESPOSITO>When I came to check on it, that's when I saw your car.

482
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,810
<17-4,BECKETT>等等  埃斯波西托
<17-4,BECKETT>Wait, wait, Espo.

483
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,220
<17-4,BECKETT>523在转角处  你还有枪吗
<17-4,BECKETT>523 is around the corner. You got an extra piece?

484
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,260
<17-5,ESPOSITO>有
<17-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

485
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,840
<17-6,CASTLE>好极了  那我呢
<17-6,CASTLE>Nice. What about for me?

486
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,850
<17-7,ESPOSITO>你难道要我带两把备用的枪吗
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, you mean an extra extra piece?

487
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,160
<17-7,ESPOSITO>不许动
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Don't move.

488
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,080
<18-1,BECKETT>喘气都不行
<18-1,BECKETT>Don't even breathe.

489
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,120
<18-1,BECKETT>敢拿枪  我就一枪崩了你
<18-1,BECKETT>Reach for it, and I'll blow your head off.

490
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,810
<18-2,MADDOX>好吧  警探  你是老大
<18-2,MADDOX>Okay, detective. You're in charge.

491
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,410
<18-3,BECKETT>慢慢弯腰  把文件给我
<18-3,BECKETT>Now slowly reach down and hand me the file.

492
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,280
<18-4,ESPOSITO>他死了
<18-4,ESPOSITO>He's gone.

493
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,780
<18-5,CASTLE>多谢警告  史密斯
<18-5,CASTLE>Thanks for the warning, Smith.

494
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,150
<18-6,BECKETT>他知道马多克斯会先到这里
<18-6,BECKETT>He knew that Maddox would show up here first.

495
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,760
<18-6,BECKETT>这是什...
<18-6,BECKETT>What the...

496
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,780
<18-7,CASTLE>是文件
<18-7,CASTLE>The file.

497
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,310
<19-1,GATES>听听我的理解对不对
<19-1,GATES>So let me see if I understand.

498
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,900
<19-1,GATES>无巧不成书  你们三个
<19-1,GATES>As luck would have it, you three

499
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,280
<19-1,GATES>都在这个街区里散步
<19-1,GATES>were in the neighborhood taking a walk?

500
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,970
<19-2,CASTLE>很多人都认为  散步是最好的锻炼方式
<19-2,CASTLE>Well, many people consider that the best form of exercise.

501
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,520
<19-2,CASTLE>那是低冲击运动  而且...
<19-2,CASTLE>It's low impact, it has--

502
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,070
<19-3,GATES>然后你们听见爆炸声
<19-3,GATES>Then you heard an explosion,

503
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,930
<19-3,GATES>作为热心的普通市民
<19-3,GATES>and as concerned private citizens,

504
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,740
<19-3,GATES>你们就冲进来查看情况
<19-3,GATES>You rushed inside to check it out?

505
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,930
<19-4,BECKETT>对  是这样的
<19-4,BECKETT>Yeah. That's right.

506
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,810
<19-5,GATES>你记得的情况也是这样的吗
<19-5,GATES>Is that how you remember it?

507
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,770
<19-6,ESPOSITO>是的  长官
<19-6,ESPOSITO>Yes, sir.

508
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,500
<19-7,CASTLE>盖茨警监  我能以个人担保
<19-7,CASTLE>Captain Gates, I can personally vouch for that--

509
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,840
<19-7,CASTLE>我没兴趣  卡塞尔先生
<19-7,CASTLE>I am not interested, Mr. Castle,

510
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
<19-8,GATES>你可是编故事的高手
<19-8,GATES>as you specialize in fiction.

511
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,960
<19-8,GATES>我就姑且认为你们是碰巧在附近
<19-8,GATES>Let's say you happened to be in the area.

512
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,490
<19-8,GATES>但你们又怎么解释马多克斯
<19-8,GATES>How do you explain the fact that Maddox,

513
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,030
<19-8,GATES>也就是我们正搜捕的那个凶手
<19-8,GATES>the killer we're searching for

514
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,620
<19-8,GATES>也是去年开枪杀你的人
<19-8,GATES>and the man who shot you last year,

515
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,040
<19-8,GATES>死在这儿了
<19-8,GATES>is the one lying there dead?

516
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
<19-9,CASTLE>恶有恶报
<19-9,CASTLE>Bad karma.

517
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,920
<19-10,GATES>莱恩警探
<19-10,GATES>Detective Ryan.

518
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,210
<19-11,GATES>你知道关于此事的什么情况吗
<19-11,GATES>Do you know anything about this?

519
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,180
<19-12,RYAN>我只知道保险柜被动了手脚
<19-12,RYAN>Just that it appears the safe was rigged

520
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,630
<19-12,RYAN>马多克斯一打开就爆炸了
<19-12,RYAN>to blow when Maddox opened it.

521
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,450
<19-13,GATES>那保险柜里有什么
<19-13,GATES>And what was in that safe?

522
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,420
<19-14,RYAN>很难说
<19-14,RYAN>Hard to say.

523
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,750
<19-14,RYAN>好像是些文件
<19-14,RYAN>Papers of some kind.

524
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,270
<19-15,GATES>我猜你们也一定不知道那些文件是什么
<19-15,GATES>And I don't suppose you know what was in those papers

525
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,790
<19-15,GATES>也不知道马多克斯为什么出现在这儿
<19-15,GATES>and why Maddox was here.

526
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,000
<19-16,BECKETT>就像我刚才说的  我们只是路过
<19-16,BECKETT>Like I said, we were just walking by.

527
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,780
<20-1,BECKETT>我们差一点就知道真相了
<20-1,BECKETT>We were so close.

528
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,170
<20-1,BECKETT>那份文件本来可以告诉我们谁是幕后黑手
<20-1,BECKETT>That file would've told us who's at the center of this

529
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,320
<20-1,BECKETT>谁杀了我母亲
<20-1,BECKETT>and who killed my mom.

530
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,210
<20-2,ESPOSITO>至少马多克斯不会再追杀你了
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Well, at least Maddox won't be coming after you.

531
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,660
<20-3,BECKETT>他们还会派别人来杀我的
<20-3,BECKETT>They'll just send somebody else.

532
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,890
<20-4,CASTLE>除非幕后黑手
<20-4,CASTLE>Unless whoever's behind all this

533
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,580
<20-4,CASTLE>不知道文件已经被毁掉了
<20-4,CASTLE>doesn't know the file's been destroyed.

534
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,110
<20-4,CASTLE>或许他以为文件还好好的
<20-4,CASTLE>Maybe he thinks it's still in play.

535
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,130
<20-5,BECKETT>我觉得不太可能  你说呢
<20-5,BECKETT>I wouldn't bet on that. Would you?

536
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,080
<20-6,RYAN>你能把枪收起来了吗
<20-6,RYAN>You want to put that thing away?

537
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,200
<20-7,ESPOSITO>除非你不当叛徒了
<20-7,ESPOSITO>Well, if it isn't Judas.

538
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
<20-8,RYAN>行  好的  哥们儿
<20-8,RYAN>Yeah, okay, pal.

539
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,810
<20-8,RYAN>你能别揪着那事不放了吗
<20-8,RYAN>You want to give it a break?

540
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,040
<20-9,BECKETT>伙计们  别闹了
<20-9,BECKETT>Guys, come on.

541
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,580
<20-10,ESPOSITO>你来这儿干嘛
<20-10,ESPOSITO>What are you doing here?

542
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,980
<20-11,RYAN>给你们带来了这些东西
<20-11,RYAN>I came to bring you this.

543
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,450
<20-12,BECKETT>保险柜里的文件
<20-12,BECKETT>Paper from the safe?

544
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,560
<21-1,ESPOSITO>我们现在要找些什么
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Now what are we looking for?

545
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,830
<21-2,BECKETT>名字  地址  日期
<21-2,BECKETT>Names, places, dates--

546
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,690
<21-2,BECKETT>任何能告诉我们那些文件里写了些什么的线索
<21-2,BECKETT>anything that tells us what was in these files

547
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,050
<21-2,BECKETT>以及为什么有人不惜一切地要隐藏它
<21-2,BECKETT>and why someone is so desperate to keep it hidden.

548
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,580
<21-3,ESPOSITO>忙活了五个小时了
<21-3,ESPOSITO>Five hours,

549
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,320
<21-3,ESPOSITO>我就只拼出扑克牌大小的一块来
<21-3,ESPOSITO>and all I got is something the size of a playing card.

550
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,560
<21-3,ESPOSITO>而且上面什么也没有
<21-3,ESPOSITO>and not only that, it's blank.

551
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,370
<21-4,RYAN>我拼出一块写着"期末余额"
<21-4,RYAN>Yeah, well, I got "Ending balance" Here.

552
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,400
<21-4,RYAN>我觉得好像是张银行结单
<21-4,RYAN>I think it's some kind of bank statement.

553
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,300
<21-5,BECKETT>不仅仅是张银行结单
<21-5,BECKETT>Not just a bank statement.

554
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,880
<21-6,CASTLE>这是一张现金汇票的一部分
<21-6,CASTLE>This is part of a money order made out to cash.

555
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,750
<21-6,CASTLE>可能是一笔黑钱
<21-6,CASTLE>That could be a payoff.

556
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,660
<21-7,BECKETT>收款人很有可能就是我们要找的人
<21-7,BECKETT>And whoever it went to is probably our guy.

557
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,840
<21-8,CASTLE>这就讲得通了
<21-8,CASTLE>Well, that would make sense.

558
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,550
<21-9,RYAN>是吗  怎么讲
<21-9,RYAN>Yeah? In what way?

559
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,410
<21-10,CASTLE>所有的这一切都起源于
<21-10,CASTLE>Well, all of this started

560
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,940
<21-10,CASTLE>蒙哥马利和他的警察兄弟们
<21-10,CASTLE>when Montgomery and his cop buddies

561
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,200
<21-10,CASTLE>开始绑架犯罪团伙成员并索要赎金
<21-10,CASTLE>started kidnapping mobsters for ransom money.

562
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,390
<21-11,BECKETT>我们知道有人发现了这个情况
<21-11,BECKETT>And we know that someone found out

563
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,290
<21-11,BECKETT>并想要从中抽成
<21-11,BECKETT>and demanded a cut of that money.

564
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,380
<21-12,CASTLE>无论那个人是谁
<21-12,CASTLE>And whoever that is,

565
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,710
<21-12,CASTLE>他都不想让文件里的内容泄漏出去
<21-12,CASTLE>there's something in this file he does not want to get out.

566
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,340
<21-13,ESPOSITO>这  这张上面有个数字
<21-13,ESPOSITO>Whoa, this-- this has numbers on it.

567
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,090
<21-13,ESPOSITO>还是打印的
<21-13,ESPOSITO>And it's machine printed.

568
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,850
<21-13,ESPOSITO>是个8位数字串  所以不可能是电话号码
<21-13,ESPOSITO>It's an 8-digit string, so it's not a phone number.

569
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,090
<21-14,CASTLE>等一下  那个是
<21-14,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Oh, that's the--

570
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,860
<21-15,ESPOSITO>这是那张汇票的反面
<21-15,ESPOSITO>this is the back of that money order.

571
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,800
<21-15,ESPOSITO>这些数字
<21-15,ESPOSITO>And these digits,

572
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,610
<21-15,ESPOSITO>0-8-6-7-2-2-4-1
<21-15,ESPOSITO>0-8-6-7-2-2-4-1,

573
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,630
<21-15,ESPOSITO>这是存款的账户
<21-15,ESPOSITO>That's the account it was deposited in.

574
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,200
<21-16,BECKETT>如果我们能查出这个账户是谁的
<21-16,BECKETT>If we figure out whose account that is,

575
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,440
<21-16,BECKETT>就能找到一个嫌疑人的名字
<21-16,BECKETT>that should give us a name.

576
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,410
<21-17,RYAN>我想我知道一个办法
<21-17,RYAN>And I think I know a way.

577
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,990
<21-17,RYAN>还记得当时我们调查脏弹那个案子时
<21-17,RYAN>Uh, do you remember when we were checking

578
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,950
<21-17,RYAN>检查过一些银行账户吗
<21-17,RYAN>banking accounts for the dirty bomb investigation?

579
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,910
<21-17,RYAN>我们利用的是联邦银行数据库
<21-17,RYAN>We used the federal banking database.

580
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,960
<21-18,ESPOSITO>我还记得数据库的密码
<21-18,ESPOSITO>And I still remember the password.

581
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,520
<22-1,ESPOSITO>我不确定能不能查到那么久以前的账户了
<22-1,ESPOSITO>I'm not sure they even track accounts going back this far.

582
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,030
<22-2,BECKETT>那个账户的主人
<22-2,BECKETT>Whoever owns that account

583
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,310
<22-2,BECKETT>就是杀我母亲的凶手
<22-2,BECKETT>is the person that killed my mom.

584
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,160
<22-2,BECKETT>查吧
<22-2,BECKETT>Run it.

587
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,630
<22-3,ESPOSITO>这个账户19年前就关闭了
<22-3,ESPOSITO>The account was closed 19 years ago.

588
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,200
<22-3,ESPOSITO>户主的名字是威廉·布莱肯
<22-3,ESPOSITO>It belonged to a guy named William H. Bracken.

589
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,120
<22-4,BECKETT>你是说威廉·布莱肯议员吧
<22-4,BECKETT>You mean Senator William Bracken?

590
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,830
<23-1,RYAN>根据他竞选网站上的个人简历
<23-1,RYAN>According to the bio on his campaign web site,

591
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,970
<23-1,RYAN>布莱肯参议员曾在1988-1992年
<23-1,RYAN>Senator Bracken was assistant district attorney

592
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,010
<23-1,RYAN>担任纽约地区助理检察官
<23-1,RYAN>for New York from '88 till '92.

593
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,390
<23-2,CASTLE>凯特
<23-2,CASTLE>Kate?

594
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,400
<23-3,BECKETT>我没事  卡塞尔
<23-3,BECKETT>I'm fine, Castle.

595
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,250
<23-4,BECKETT>布莱肯的时间线吻合
<23-4,BECKETT>Bracken's timeline fits.

596
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,130
<23-4,BECKETT>当时蒙哥马利正在绑架犯罪团伙成员
<23-4,BECKETT>That's when Montgomery was kidnapping gangsters.

597
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,470
<23-5,ESPOSITO>布莱肯一定是通过小道消息
<23-5,ESPOSITO>Bracken must have heard about what they were doing

598
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,350
<23-5,ESPOSITO>听说了他们的勾当
<23-5,ESPOSITO>through the grapevine.

599
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,060
<23-6,BECKETT>然后他意识到他无法提起公诉
<23-6,BECKETT>And then he realized that he couldn't charge mobsters

600
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,130
<23-6,BECKETT>因为黑帮成员不会出庭作证
<23-6,BECKETT>because they wouldn't testify

601
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,450
<23-6,BECKETT>那样那些警察就会逍遥法外
<23-6,BECKETT>and then the cops would walk.

602
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,870
<23-7,RYAN>所以他索性参与其中
<23-7,RYAN>So instead he decided to get in on the action.

603
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,830
<23-7,RYAN>如果他们从罪犯那里收取赎金
<23-7,RYAN>If they were collecting ransom from mob guys,

604
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,540
<23-7,RYAN>他想分一杯羹  以现金汇票的形式抽成
<23-7,RYAN>He wanted a taste in the form of cash money orders.

605
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,420
<23-8,CASTLE>对  不过随着他光辉的政坛生涯
<23-8,CASTLE>Right, but as his political star rose

606
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,530
<23-8,CASTLE>由国会议员一跃而升至参议员
<23-8,CASTLE>from congressman to senator,

607
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,330
<23-8,CASTLE>他意识到
<23-8,CASTLE>he realized...

608
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,910
<23-8,CASTLE>他必须确保这则丑闻永不见天日
<23-8,CASTLE>He had to make sure the scandal never came to light.

609
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,390
<23-9,BECKETT>接着就有人为此丧命
<23-9,BECKETT>So then people started dying.

610
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,660
<23-10,RYAN>-这就解释了  -我是莱恩
<23-10,RYAN>- This would explain... - Ryan.

611
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,960
<23-11,CASTLE>他现在为什么咬着你不放
<23-11,CASTLE>Why he's coming after you right now.

612
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,290
<23-11,CASTLE>有传言  说布莱肯被举荐竞选总统
<23-11,CASTLE>Word is, Bracken's being groomed to run for president.

613
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,230
<23-12,ESPOSITO>他想清理黑历史  你就是下一个
<23-12,ESPOSITO>He's trying to clean house, and you're next.

614
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,320
<23-12,ESPOSITO>我们得扳倒他
<23-12,ESPOSITO>We need to take him down.

615
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,410
<23-13,BECKET>怎么扳  我们手头只握有一些数字
<23-13,BECKET>How? All we have are a bunch of numbers

616
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,690
<23-13,BECKET>除了对我们  对其他任何人都毫无意义
<23-13,BECKET>that are meaningless to anyone but us.

617
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,540
<23-13,BECKET>我们根本没有指控他的铁证
<23-13,BECKET>We have absolutely no hard evidence against him.

618
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,060
<23-14,RYAN>或许我手中有条次一些的线索
<23-14,RYAN>Uh, I may have the next best thing.

619
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,820
<23-14,RYAN>我刚收到消息
<23-14,RYAN>I just got word

620
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,530
<23-14,RYAN>迈克尔·史密斯刚做完手术
<23-14,RYAN>that Michael Smith is out of surgery,

621
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,760
<23-14,RYAN>而且醒来了
<23-14,RYAN>And he's awake.

622
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,030
<23-15,CASTLE>史密斯就是关键
<23-15,CASTLE>Smith is the key.

623
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,770
<23-15,CASTLE>他能把全部线索与布莱肯联系上
<23-15,CASTLE>He can connect all this to Bracken.

624
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,440
<23-16,BECKETT>那好  我和卡塞尔去找他谈谈
<23-16,BECKETT>Okay, Castle and I are gonna go talk to him.

625
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,610
<23-16,BECKETT>你们试着能不能找出
<23-16,BECKETT>You guys see if you can find the link

626
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,120
<23-16,BECKETT>马多克斯和布莱肯之间的联系
<23-16,BECKETT>between Maddox and Bracken.

627
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,490
<24-1,BECKETT>莱恩打电话说了
<24-1,BECKETT>Ryan call you?

628
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,480
<24-2,OFFICER>是的  说了
<24-2,OFFICER>Yeah, yeah.

629
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,590
<24-3,SMITH>你们还活着
<24-3,SMITH>You're alive.

630
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,520
<24-4,CASTLE>彼此彼此
<24-4,CASTLE>Join the club.

631
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,220
<24-5,SMITH>那一部分文件呢
<24-5,SMITH>What about the other file?

632
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,820
<24-6,CASTLE>马多克斯打开了保险箱
<24-6,CASTLE>Maddox opened the safe.

633
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,660
<24-7,BECKETT>拼凑之下  我们发现布莱肯收了黑钱
<24-7,BECKETT>We put enough of it together to know that Bracken took dirty money.

634
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,170
<24-8,SMITH>关门
<24-8,SMITH>Close the door.

635
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,750
<24-9,SMITH>讽刺的是  他用那笔黑钱赞助了
<24-9,SMITH>The irony is, he used that money to finance

636
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,600
<24-9,SMITH>自己的头一次国会竞选
<24-9,SMITH>his first congressional campaign.

637
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,290
<24-10,BECKETT>我们需要证据证明这一点
<24-10,BECKETT>We need proof of that,

638
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,560
<24-10,BECKETT>连同他所犯下的一切罪恶
<24-10,BECKETT>along with anything else that he did.

639
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,210
<24-11,SMITH>没有证据
<24-11,SMITH>There is no proof.

640
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,800
<24-12,BECKETT>不是还有你吗  你可以作证
<24-12,BECKETT>Well, there's you. You can testify.

641
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,070
<24-13,SMITH>那是不可能的
<24-13,SMITH>That will never happen.

642
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,450
<24-13,SMITH>罗伊·蒙哥马利帮过我一个忙
<24-13,SMITH>You see, Roy Montgomery once did me a favor.

643
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,690
<24-13,SMITH>我才会藏着那份文件  才会保护你
<24-13,SMITH>So I kept that file and I protected you

644
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,410
<24-13,SMITH>我付出了很大的代价
<24-13,SMITH>At great personal cost

645
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,460
<24-13,SMITH>因为我欠罗伊的
<24-13,SMITH>because I owed Roy.

646
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,350
<24-13,SMITH>可我不欠你的
<24-13,SMITH>But I don't owe you.

647
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,820
<24-14,BECKETT>你就打算这么让他
<24-14,BECKETT>So you're just gonna let him

648
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,950
<24-14,BECKETT>逃脱谋杀罪的制裁吗
<24-14,BECKETT>G-get away with murder?

649
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,570
<24-15,SMITH>你不明白  探长
<24-15,SMITH>You don't understand, detective.

650
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,750
<24-15,SMITH>他有保护伞  动不得
<24-15,SMITH>He's protected, untouchable.

651
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,290
<24-15,SMITH>你的结局只会是死路一条
<24-15,SMITH>You're just gonna end up dead,

652
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,610
<24-15,SMITH>我也难逃一死
<24-15,SMITH>And so am I.

653
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,300
<24-15,SMITH>现在看来
<24-15,SMITH>Now as it is,

654
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,940
<24-15,SMITH>我最好的办法  就是
<24-15,SMITH>My best bet is to just...

655
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,180
<24-15,SMITH>销声匿迹
<24-15,SMITH>Disappear.

656
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,800
<24-15,SMITH>我也这么建议你
<24-15,SMITH>I suggest you do the same.

657
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,930
<24-16,BECKETT>你清楚自己知道得太多了
<24-16,BECKETT>You know that you know too much,

658
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,100
<24-16,BECKETT>就和罗伊还有我母亲一样
<24-16,BECKETT>just like Roy and my mom did.

659
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,510
<24-16,BECKETT>他们找到了你一次  就还能再找到你
<24-16,BECKETT>They found you once. They will find you again.

660
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,140
<24-16,BECKETT>你唯一的办法就是跟我合作
<24-16,BECKETT>And your only bet is to work with me.

661
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,210
<24-17,SMITH>我累了
<24-17,SMITH>I'm tired.

662
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,520
<24-17,SMITH>你们该走了
<24-17,SMITH>You need to go.

663
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,300
<25-1,CASTLE>好的  谢谢
<25-1,CASTLE>Okay. Thank you.

664
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,800
<25-1,CASTLE>对  你们一查到任何线索就通知我
<25-1,CASTLE>Yeah, you just let me know if you figure anything out.

665
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,910
<25-2,CASTLE>是莱恩的电话
<25-2,CASTLE>All right. That was Ryan.

666
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,950
<25-2,CASTLE>他说他们
<25-2,CASTLE>He said they found

667
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,980
<25-2,CASTLE>查不到马多克斯和布莱肯之间确凿的联系
<25-2,CASTLE>no concrete connection between Maddox and Bracken.

668
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,380
<25-3,BECKETT>是啊  我们找不到的
<25-3,BECKETT>Yeah, and we won't find one.

669
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,410
<25-3,BECKETT>他太小心了
<25-3,BECKETT>He's too careful.

670
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,880
<25-4,CASTLE>史密斯就是关联
<25-4,CASTLE>Smith is the connection.

671
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,530
<25-5,BECKETT>没错  但他不愿意合作  卡塞尔
<25-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but he won't cooperate, Castle.

672
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,920
<25-5,BECKETT>他刚刚已经说得很明确了
<25-5,BECKETT>He's already made that clear.

673
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,060
<25-6,CASTLE>那是他唯一的活路了
<25-6,CASTLE>This is his only play.

674
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,430
<25-6,CASTLE>他那么聪明应该知道这一点
<25-6,CASTLE>He's smart enough to know that.

675
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,430
<25-6,CASTLE>他只是需要一点鼓动
<25-6,CASTLE>He just needs a little bit of encouragement.

676
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,610
<25-7,BECKETT>好吧
<25-7,BECKETT>Okay.

677
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,560
<25-8,BECKETT>等等  你怎么不守着史密斯
<25-8,BECKETT>Hey. Wait. Why aren't you with Smith?

678
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,400
<25-9,OFFICER>调度室打来让我离开的
<25-9,OFFICER>Dispatch called and told me to stand down.

679
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,260
<26-2,BECKETT>慢着  出什么事了
<26-2,BECKETT>Wait. Wait. What happened?

680
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,830
<26-3,NURSE>似乎是心脏病发作  我们已经尽力了
<26-3,NURSE>Looks like a heart attack. We did everything we could.

681
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,430
<26-3,NURSE>女士们先生们
<26-3,NURSE>Ladies and gentlemen,

682
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,470
<26-3,NURSE>我很骄傲地向大家引荐
<26-3,NURSE>I am proud to introduce to you

683
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,340

<27-2,VICE PRESIDENT RUSSELL>谢谢  布莱肯参议员
<27-2,VICE PRESIDENT RUSSELL>Thank you, senator Bracken.

687
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,430
<27-3,BECKETT>我终于查到了那个人
<27-3,BECKETT>I finally figured out who he is--

688
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,950
<27-3,BECKETT>那个杀害了我母亲的人
<27-3,BECKETT>The guy that killed my mom--

689
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,960
<27-3,BECKETT>可我现在却束手无策
<27-3,BECKETT>And there's nothing I can do about it.

690
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,040
<27-3,BECKETT>莱恩跟你通话了吗
<27-3,BECKETT>Did Ryan talk to you?

691
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,500
<27-3,BECKETT>他查过了史密斯病房周围的
<27-3,BECKETT>Did he check those security cameras

692
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,830
<27-3,BECKETT>那些监控录像了吗
<27-3,BECKETT>around Smith's room?

693
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,190
<27-4,CASTLE>查了
<27-4,CASTLE>Yes.

694
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,750
<27-5,BECKETT>结果呢
<27-5,BECKETT>And?

695
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,780
<27-6,CASTLE>摄像头失都灵了
<27-6,CASTLE>The cameras were disabled.

696
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,860
<27-7,BECKETT>好吧  他们要冲着我来了
<27-7,BECKETT>Okay. So they're coming for me.

697
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,170
<27-8,CASTLE>莱恩派了两队人守在外面
<27-8,CASTLE>Ryan's got two teams stationed outside.

698
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,950
<27-9,BECKETT>那明天怎么办
<27-9,BECKETT>And what about tomorrow

699
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
<27-9,BECKETT>后天又该怎么办
<27-9,BECKETT>and the day after that?

700
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,940
<27-10,CASTLE>让我带你走吧  凯特
<27-10,CASTLE>Let me take you someplace, Kate,

701
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,060
<27-10,CASTLE>去个你会安全的地方
<27-10,CASTLE>Someplace you'll be safe.

702
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,960
<27-11,BECKETT>我再无宁日了
<27-11,BECKETT>I'll never be safe.

703
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,910
<28-1,RYAN>什么叫她不在这里
<28-1,RYAN>What do you mean, she's not here?

00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,790
<28-2,CASTLE>就是她人不在这里
<28-2,CASTLE>I mean, she's not here

705
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,010
<28-2,CASTLE>电话也不接
<28-2,CASTLE>and she's not answering her cell.

706
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,310
<28-3,ESPOSITO>你不是派人盯着她了吗
<28-3,ESPOSITO>I thought you had a detail on her.

00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,660
<28-4,RYAN>我有啊  现在还盯着呢
<28-4,RYAN>I did. I do.

708
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,930
<28-4,RYAN>如果她离开了这栋楼
<28-4,RYAN>If she would've left this building,

709
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:47,900
<28-4,RYAN>他们会注意到她的
<28-4,RYAN>They would've seen her.

710
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,620
<28-5,CASTLE>除非她不想被发现
<28-5,CASTLE>Not if she didn't want them to.

711
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,590
<28-5,CASTLE>布莱肯议员现在在哪里
<28-5,CASTLE>Where is Senator Bracken right now?

<28-8,RYAN>他在维马克酒店主持一场募捐会
<28-8,RYAN>He's hosting a fund-raiser at the Widmark Hotel.

717
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,470
<28-9,CASTLE>问问有没有人查问过他的行踪
<28-9,CASTLE>Ask if anyone else has called to check on him.

718
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,980
<28-10,RYAN>还有其他人问过他的行踪吗
<28-10,RYAN>Did anyone call to check on him?

<28-10,RYAN>Beckett phoned 'em an hour ago.

721
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,730
<28-11,CASTLE>她会直接把布莱肯议员干掉的
<28-11,CASTLE>She's gonna kill Senator Bracken.

747
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,410
<30-6,BRACKEN>但我对玩游戏不感兴趣

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,110
<30-7,BECKETT>那你最好培养一下兴趣
<30-7,BECKETT>Well, you better get interested.

<31-2,SECURITY MAN>他正在与一位捐赠人会谈
<31-2,SECURITY MAN>He's in meeting with a donor.

<31-3,CASTLE>什么捐赠人  他在哪
<31-3,CASTLE>What donor? Where is he?

754
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,730
<31-4,SECURITY MAN>他没有说
<31-4,SECURITY MAN>He didn't say.

755
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,290
<31-5,ESPOSITO>你要给谁打电话
<31-5,ESPOSITO>Who are you calling?

756
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,240
<31-5,ESPOSITO>盖茨吗
<31-5,ESPOSITO>Gates?

757
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,630
<31-7,ESPOSITO>把电话放回去  不然我就扭断你的手臂
<31-7,ESPOSITO>Put that phone away or I'm gonna break your friggin' arm.

758
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,840
<31-8,RYAN>哈维尔  我们不能眼睁睁地看她去送死
<31-8,RYAN>Javi, we can't let her throw her life away.

759
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,240
<31-9,CASTLE>我们还不确定她是否真要那么做
<31-9,CASTLE>We don't know she's doing that.

760
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,740
<31-9,CASTLE>你什么意思
<31-9,CASTLE>What do you mean?

761
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,220
<31-10,RYAN>是你说她会直接把那家伙干掉的
<31-10,RYAN>You're the one who said she was gonna kill the guy.

762
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,170
<31-10,RYAN>好吧  我知道  对  但是...
<31-10,RYAN>Okay, I know. Okay, yes, that's right, but...

763
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,470
<31-11,CASTLE>但她还没动手  对吧
<31-11,CASTLE>But she hasn't done that yet, right?

764
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,720
<31-11,CASTLE>如果你打了那通电话
<31-11,CASTLE>Look, you make that call,

765
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,090
<31-11,CASTLE>就给她贴上了杀手的标签
<31-11,CASTLE>you're labeling her an assassin.

766
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,420
<31-11,CASTLE>以后想撕也撕不下来了
<31-11,CASTLE>That's a bell you can't unring.

767
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,890
<31-11,CASTLE>所以  暂时先别告诉盖茨吧
<31-11,CASTLE>So let's not make that call, not yet.

768
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,270
<31-12,CASTLE>好吧
<31-12,CASTLE>All right.

769
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,150
<32-1,BECKETT>就站那儿够了
<32-1,BECKETT>That's far enough.

770
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,250
<32-2,BRACKEN>你想要什么  贝克特女士
<32-2,BRACKEN>What do you want, Ms. Beckett?

771
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,870
<32-3,BECKETT>真相
<32-3,BECKETT>The truth.

772
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,940
<32-4,BRACKEN>永远别向政客索要真相
<32-4,BRACKEN>Never expect that from a politician.

773
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,320
<32-4,BRACKEN>再说  你手上如果真有什么信息
<32-4,BRACKEN>Besides, if you really had information,

774
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,710
<32-4,BRACKEN>你不该早就了解真相了吗
<32-4,BRACKEN>Wouldn't you already know the truth?

775
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,520
<32-5,BECKETT>罗伊·蒙哥马利  麦卡利斯特
<32-5,BECKETT>Roy Montgomery, McCallister,

776
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,710
<32-5,BECKETT>约翰·拉格兰和我母亲
<32-5,BECKETT>John Raglan, my mother--

777
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,670
<32-5,BECKETT>每一个被你杀害的人
<32-5,BECKETT>Everyone that you've ever had killed,

778
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,460
<32-5,BECKETT>我要你承认你的罪行
<32-5,BECKETT>I want you to admit to it.

779
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,260
<32-6,BRACKEN>你母亲的死是个悲剧
<32-6,BRACKEN>Your mother's death was a tragedy...

780
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,990
<32-6,BRACKEN>我对此深表哀悼
<32-6,BRACKEN>and I am deeply sorry for your loss.

781
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,060
<32-6,BRACKEN>但我不能满足你的要求
<32-6,BRACKEN>But I can't give you what you want.

782
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,520
<32-6,BRACKEN>我14岁的时候
<32-6,BRACKEN>When I was 14,

783
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,140
<32-7,BRACKEN>与邻家的小男孩成了好朋友
<32-7,BRACKEN>I got to be friends with this boy in the neighborhood--

784
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,120
<32-7,BRACKEN>他叫拉玛·德克斯  是个很可爱的孩子
<32-7,BRACKEN>Lamar Dokes. Sweet kid.

785
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,570
<32-7,BRACKEN>放学后我常常帮他复习功课
<32-7,BRACKEN>I used to help him with his homework after school.

786
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,870
<32-7,BRACKEN>有一天  他没去上学
<32-7,BRACKEN>Well, one day, he doesn't come to school.

787
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,230
<32-7,BRACKEN>所以我到他家去看他
<32-7,BRACKEN>So I went by his apartment

788
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,170
<32-7,BRACKEN>他家的门是敞开的
<32-7,BRACKEN>And the door was open.

789
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,180
<32-7,BRACKEN>我进去了
<32-7,BRACKEN>I walked in

790
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,460
<32-7,BRACKEN>然后
<32-7,BRACKEN>And...

791
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,650
<32-7,BRACKEN>我发现拉玛躺在他的床上  死了
<32-7,BRACKEN>I found Lamar lying on his mattress... dead,

792
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,850
<32-7,BRACKEN>他的小妹妹也一样
<32-7,BRACKEN>His little sister the same way.

793
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,150
<32-7,BRACKEN>他母亲在卧室
<32-7,BRACKEN>His mother was in the bedroom.

794
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,390
<32-7,BRACKEN>上吊死了
<32-7,BRACKEN>She had hanged herself.

795
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,660
<32-7,BRACKEN>她留下一张纸条  说她丢了工作
<32-7,BRACKEN>Now she left a note. She'd lost her job.

796
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,560
<32-7,BRACKEN>将被驱逐出境
<32-7,BRACKEN>She was being evicted.

797
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,840
<32-7,BRACKEN>当时我就想  一个女人
<32-7,BRACKEN>And I thought, how could a woman

798
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,060
<32-7,BRACKEN>怎能如此万念俱灰  失去一切希望
<32-7,BRACKEN>be so desperate, so without hope,

799
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,780
<32-7,BRACKEN>以至于她竟把药片碾碎
<32-7,BRACKEN>that she could crush up pills,

800
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,810
<32-7,BRACKEN>融进热可可里
<32-7,BRACKEN>put them in hot chocolate,

801
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,920
<32-7,BRACKEN>喂给自己的孩子喝
<32-7,BRACKEN>and give them to her kids?

802
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,880
<32-7,BRACKEN>就在那一刻...
<32-7,BRACKEN>And that was the moment...

803
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,290
<32-7,BRACKEN>那一刻我意识到
<32-7,BRACKEN>The moment I knew

804
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,600
<32-11,BRACKEN>我要帮助人们过上更美好的生活
<32-11,BRACKEN>I wanted to help make people's lives better.

805
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,040
<32-12,BECKETT>我也做到了
<32-12,BECKETT>And I have.

806
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,480
<32-7,BRACKEN>我加强了社会保障制度
<32-7,BRACKEN>I strengthened the safety net

807
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,070
<32-7,BRACKEN>保护像拉玛一样的孩子
<32-7,BRACKEN>to protect kids like Lamar.

808
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,040
<32-7,BRACKEN>我在那些社区创造了就业机会
<32-7,BRACKEN>I created jobs in those neighborhoods.

809
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,350
<32-7,BRACKEN>我做了许多好事
<32-7,BRACKEN>I've done great things...

810
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,610
<32-7,BRACKEN>正如你也做了许多好事
<32-7,BRACKEN>Just as you've done great things.

811
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,700
<32-8,BECKETT>你以为你在和谁说话
<32-8,BECKETT>Who do you think you're talking to?

812
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,250
<32-8,BECKETT>你有什么资格在我面前为自己辩解
<32-8,BECKETT>How can you justify yourself to me?

813
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,590
<32-8,BECKETT>我母亲因为你  在小巷中被捅死
<32-8,BECKETT>My mother was stabbed in an alley because of you.

814
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,610
<32-8,BECKETT>她在垃圾堆中  孤零零地流血至死
<32-8,BECKETT>She bled to death alone in a pile of garbage!

815
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,090
<32-8,BECKETT>所以省省你那竞选的演讲词
<32-8,BECKETT>So save me your campaign speeches

816
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,810
<32-8,BECKETT>少说些狗屁美好的事吧
<32-8,BECKETT>about the great things.

817
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,310
<32-9,BRACKEN>你似乎有点妄想症  你知道吧
<32-9,BRACKEN>You sound a bit delusional, you know?

818
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,630
<32-9,BRACKEN>话说回来  你是谁
<32-9,BRACKEN>But then again, who are you?

819
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,030
<32-9,BRACKEN>你是一个丢脸的警察
<32-9,BRACKEN>You're a disgraced cop,

820
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,030
<32-9,BRACKEN>深陷自己母亲的谋杀案中
<32-9,BRACKEN>obsessed with her mother's murder.

821
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,350
<32-9,BRACKEN>而我是谁
<32-9,BRACKEN>And who am I?

822
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,860
<32-9,BRACKEN>我是一个高尚的关心底层群众利益的人
<32-9,BRACKEN>I'm a decent man looking out for the little guy.

823
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,480
<32-9,BRACKEN>公众眼中的我就是那样的
<32-9,BRACKEN>That's who the public sees.

824
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,820
<32-9,BRACKEN>每次他们选我的时候
<32-9,BRACKEN>And every time they elect me,

825
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,500
<32-9,BRACKEN>我都心怀卑谦
<32-9,BRACKEN>I'm humbled.

826
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,790
<32-9,BRACKEN>我会更加努力地去实现这个理想
<32-9,BRACKEN>I strive harder to live up to that ideal.

827
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,040
<32-9,BRACKEN>我想要成为那样的人
<32-9,BRACKEN>I want to be that man.

828
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,190
<32-9,BRACKEN>我也绝不会让你或是其他任何人
<32-9,BRACKEN>And I won't let you or anyone else

829
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,910
<32-9,BRACKEN>挡我的路
<32-9,BRACKEN>get in my way.

830
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,200
<32-10,BECKETT>我觉得你现在没资格威胁我  参议员
<32-10,BECKETT>I don't think you're in a position to threaten, senator.

831
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,610
<32-11,BRACKEN>瞧  所以说你不明白
<32-11,BRACKEN>See, here's what you don't understand--

832
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,030
<32-11,BRACKEN>这不取决于谁手中有枪
<32-11,BRACKEN>It's not who has the gun,

833
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,570
<32-11,BRACKEN>而取决于谁握有掌控权
<32-11,BRACKEN>it's who has the power.

834
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,200
<32-11,BRACKEN>你真的觉得是你吗
<32-11,BRACKEN>Do you really think that's you?

835
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,850
<32-12,BECKETT>我拿到文件了
<32-12,BECKETT>I have the file.

836
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,050
<32-13,BECKETT>史密斯还有一份复件
<32-13,BECKETT>Smith had another copy.

837
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,080
<32-13,BECKETT>08672241
<32-13,BECKETT>0-8-6-7-2-2-4-1.

838
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,780
<32-14,BECKETT>那是你当年
<32-14,BECKETT>That's the number of the bank account

839
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,460
<32-14,BECKETT>存入汇款的银行账户
<32-14,BECKETT>where you deposited the money orders.

840
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,880
<32-14,BECKETT>所以你说的对
<32-14,BECKETT>So you're right.

841
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,900
<32-14,BECKETT>关键就在于谁握有掌控权
<32-14,BECKETT>It is about who holds the power.

842
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,600
<32-14,BECKETT>现在我可以公开文件  让你身败名裂
<32-14,BECKETT>Now I could release that file and destroy you,

843
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,450
<32-14,BECKETT>但是这样做对我又有什么意义呢
<32-14,BECKETT>but what would that mean for my life expectancy?

844
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,910
<32-14,BECKETT>所以现在这样
<32-14,BECKETT>So here's how it is--

845
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,020
<32-14,BECKETT>你和史密斯的交易
<32-14,BECKETT>The deal that you had with Smith,

846
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,800
<32-14,BECKETT>改成我们之间的交易
<32-14,BECKETT>that's our deal now.

847
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:01,150
<32-14,BECKETT>如果我或者任何我在乎的人  发生任何不测
<32-14,BECKETT>And if anything happens to me or anyone that I care about,

848
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,370
<32-14,BECKETT>文件就会公之于众
<32-14,BECKETT>that file goes public.

849
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,140
<32-14,BECKETT>清楚了吗
<32-14,BECKETT>Am I clear?

850
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,680
<32-15,BECKETT>回答是或者否
<32-15,BECKETT>That's a yes-or-no question.

851
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,910
<32-16,BRACKEN>是
<32-16,BRACKEN>Yes.

852
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,080
<32-17,BECKETT>还有一件事
<32-17,BECKETT>And one more thing.

853
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,130
<32-17,BECKETT>不管你觉得我是谁
<32-17,BECKETT>Whoever it is you think I am,

854
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,540
<32-17,BECKETT>不管你觉得自己了解我什么
<32-17,BECKETT>whatever it is you think you know about me,

855
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,080
<32-17,BECKETT>你根本想不到我能干出什么事
<32-17,BECKETT>you have no idea what I'm capable of

856
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,780
<32-17,BECKETT>或者做到什么地步
<32-17,BECKETT>or how far I will go.

857
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,860
<32-17,BECKETT>我担惊受怕够了
<32-17,BECKETT>I am done being afraid.

858
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,790
<32-17,BECKETT>现在  轮到你了
<32-17,BECKETT>It's your turn now.

859
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,070
<32-18,BECKETT>那会留下一道丑陋的伤疤
<32-18,BECKETT>That's gonna leave a nasty scar.

860
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,740
<32-18,BECKETT>每次你一看到它
<32-18,BECKETT>Every time you see it,

861
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,010
<32-18,BECKETT>就想想我
<32-18,BECKETT>think of me.

862
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,120
<32-19,CASTLE>凯特  告诉我你没...
<32-19,CASTLE>Kate, tell me you didn't...

863
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,110
<32-20,BECKETT>我们达成了共识
<32-20,BECKETT>We reached an understanding.

864
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,540
<32-21,ESPOSITO>你妈的案子怎么办
<32-21,ESPOSITO>What about your mom?

865

<32-22,BECKETT>我会为她寻得正义
<32-22,BECKETT>I'll get justice for her.

866
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,350
<32-22,BECKETT>只是不是今天
<32-22,BECKETT>Just not today.

867
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,940
<32-22,BECKETT>在那之前
<32-22,BECKETT>Until then,

868
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,810
<32-23,BECKETT>我要为其他人伸张正义
<32-23,BECKETT>I'll get it for others.

869
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,970
<33-1,GATES>你的辞职已经被批准了
<33-1,GATES>Your resignation has been accepted.

870
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,140
<33-1,GATES>已成定局
<33-1,GATES>The matter is settled.

871
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,950
<33-2,BECKETT>长官   在本区我的破案率最高
<33-2,BECKETT>Sir, I have the top case-closure rate in the precinct.

872
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,660
<33-2,BECKETT>现在那个开枪杀我的人已经死了
<33-2,BECKETT>And now that the man that shot me is dead,

873
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,910
<33-2,BECKETT>那个特案不会再是问题了
<33-2,BECKETT>that particular case will no longer be an issue.

874
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,940
<33-2,BECKETT>是吗
<33-2,BECKETT>Really?

875
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,020
<33-3,GATES>似乎那个特案时不时就会闹出些事
<33-3,GATES>Because it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving.

876
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,230
<33-4,GATES>我听说我们之前在医院
<33-4,GATES>I'm told we put a Michael Smith

<33-4,GATES>监控着一个叫迈克尔·史密斯的人
<33-4,GATES>under guard at the hospital.

878
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,920
<33-4,GATES>他和本案有什么关系
<33-4,GATES>What was his role in this?

879
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,970
<33-5,BECKETT>我不知道
<33-5,BECKETT>I-I don't know.

00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,950
<33-6,GATES>我不相信你
<33-6,GATES>I don't believe you.

881
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,380
<33-6,GATES>你在掩护某人  我知道是谁
<33-6,GATES>You're covering for someone, and I know who it is.

882
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,240
<33-6,GATES>但是我不打算深究过去的事情
<33-6,GATES>But I don't intend to dig up the past

883
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,260
<33-6,GATES>玷污罗伊·蒙哥马利的名誉
<33-6,GATES>and tarnish Roy Montgomery's reputation.

884
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,060
<33-6,GATES>实际上  我
<33-6,GATES>The fact is, I...

<33-6,GATES>我敬佩你的忠诚

887
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,780
<33-7,BECKETT>那是否意味着我明天可以来上班了呢
<33-7,BECKETT>Does that mean I can show up for duty tomorrow?

888
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,000
<34-1,CASTLE>不行  她说不行是什么意思
<34-1,CASTLE>No? What does she mean, no?

889
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,090
<34-2,BECKETT>我得服满停职期
<34-2,BECKETT>Well, I have to serve out my suspension,

<34-3,CASTLE>What are you gonna do in the meantime?

892
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,970
<34-4,BECKETT>我确定我会想到事情做的
<34-4,BECKETT>Oh, I'm pretty sure I'll think of something.
