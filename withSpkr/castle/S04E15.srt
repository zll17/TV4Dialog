5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,210
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>今晚的课真是太完美了
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, I had the most exquisite class this evening.

6
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,340
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>我的学生们在排练
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>My students are rehearsing

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,150
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>《灵欲春宵》里拳击的那场戏
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>the boxing scene from "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>我只庆幸他们用的是你的工作室
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>I'm just glad they were using your studio

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,120
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>而不是我的卧室
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>and not my living room.

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,770
<1-3,MARTHA>你在给我做你拿手的烤意面配干酪土司
<1-3,MARTHA>Oh, you're making me your fabulous pasta carbonara.

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,880
<1-3,MARTHA>你不用这么费心的
<1-3,MARTHA>Ohh. You shouldn't have.

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,050
<1-4,CASTLE>不是给你的
<1-4,CASTLE>I didn't.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,590
<1-4,CASTLE>实际上是给阿丽克西斯的
<1-4,CASTLE>Actually, it's for Alexis.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
<1-4,CASTLE>她最近太忙了
<1-4,CASTLE>She's just been, you know, so busy lately.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,540
<1-4,CASTLE>我想借机联络感情
<1-4,CASTLE>I thought we'd, uh, reconnect.

16
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,530
<1-4,CASTLE>所以做了她最爱吃的
<1-4,CASTLE>Mm. So her favorite dish,

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,620
<1-4,CASTLE>然后再一起看《电锯惊魂4》的导演剪辑版
<1-4,CASTLE>and then a screening of "Saw iv," the director's cut.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,980
<1-5,MARTHA>我真不忍心告诉你  亲爱的  她不会回来了
<1-5,MARTHA>Uh, I hate to tell you this, darling, but she won't be here.

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,210
<1-6,CASTLE>什么意思  她还能去哪里
<1-6,CASTLE>What do you mean? Where else would she be?

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,650
<1-7,MARTHA>她又开始新的实习工作了
<1-7,MARTHA>She's starting a new internship.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,130
<1-8,CASTLE>又换了个
<1-8,CASTLE>Another one?

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-9,MARTHA>她确实说过她想试些新鲜事物来找到她的激情
<1-9,MARTHA>She did say she wanted to try a few things to find her passion.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,240
<1-10,CASTLE>现在是九点
<1-10,CASTLE>It's 9:00 o'clock.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,770
<1-10,CASTLE>她这个时候能找到什么样的激情
<1-10,CASTLE>What kind of passion is she finding at this time of night?

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,790
<1-11,MARTHA>你的另一半来电了
<1-11,MARTHA>Aha. There. Your better half.

26
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,930
<1-12,CASTLE>别转移话题
<1-12,CASTLE>Don't change the subject.

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,700
<1-12,CASTLE>她到底在实习什么
<1-12,CASTLE>What is this internship exactly?

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,950
<1-13,MARTHA>理查德  阿丽克西斯让我发誓保密的
<1-13,MARTHA>Richard, Alexis swore me to secrecy.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,990
<1-14,CASTLE>是  可身为她的父亲
<1-14,CASTLE>Yes, but as her father--

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,900
<1-15,MARTHA>我的嘴可闭得死死的
<1-15,MARTHA>Ah, ah, ah, ah. My lips are sealed.

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:37,440
<1-16,CASTLE>那你就吃不了我的烤意面配干酪吐司了
<1-16,CASTLE>Then you won't be using them to eat my... pasta carbonara.

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,890
<1-17,MARTHA>好吧  我这么说吧
<1-17,MARTHA>All right. Well, let me say this.

33
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,760
<1-17,MARTHA>她这份实习是经过我亲自批准的
<1-17,MARTHA>This internship has my personal seal of approval.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,060
<1-18,CASTLE>这并没能让我舒坦点
<1-18,CASTLE>That doesn't make me feel any better.

35
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,090
<2-1,CASTLE>其实  问题不在于她去实习
<2-1,CASTLE>The truth is, the internship isn't the problem.

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,670
<2-1,CASTLE>而是她已经找了三份实习工作了
<2-1,CASTLE>It's the fact, she now has three of them.

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,810
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>说不准呢  卡塞尔
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Yeah, well, you never know, Castle.

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,220
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>这一份可能会以某种方式
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>This might be the one that brings the two of you

39
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,790
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>拉近你们俩的关系
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>closer together somehow.

40
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,820
<2-3,CASTLE>可能不大  我只期望
<2-3,CASTLE>I doubt it. The best I could hope for now is,

41
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,560
<2-3,CASTLE>她能学会屈居他人之下
<2-3,CASTLE>she learns to become more of an underachiever.

42
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,980
<2-4,BECKETT>对  你肯定能给她点建议
<2-4,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to give her some tips.

43
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,970
<2-4,BECKETT>情况是...
<2-4,BECKETT>So...

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,570
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>邻居们听到激烈的打斗声
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>neighbors heard a hellacious fight,

45
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,650
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>然后死者
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>and then our victim here

46
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,270
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>从那扇四层的窗户掉下来
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>sailed out of that fourth-floor window.

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,410
<2-6,BECKETT>那是他的公寓吗
<2-6,BECKETT>Was that his apartment?

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,020
<2-7,ESPOSITO>我们在查  可看上去不像
<2-7,ESPOSITO>We're checking, but it doesn't look like it.

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,180
<2-7,ESPOSITO>住户们不认识他  他也没有任何证件
<2-7,ESPOSITO>Tenants don't recognize him and he doesn't have any I.D.

50
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,720
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>没证件  可死因有很多
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>No I.D., but lots of causes of death.

51
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,960
<2-9,CASTLE>你是说除了坠楼
<2-9,CASTLE>You mean other than gravity?

52
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,020
<2-10,LANIE>对
<2-10,LANIE>Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,840
<2-10,LANIE>看到那处枪伤吗
<2-10,LANIE>See that bullet wound?

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,910
<2-11,BECKETT>那他在坠楼前遭枪击
<2-11,BECKETT>So he was shot before he fell?

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,030
<2-12,LANIE>还挨刀子了
<2-12,LANIE>And stabbed.

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
<2-13,BECKETT>又遭枪击又挨刀
<2-13,BECKETT>Shot and stabbed?

57
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,200
<2-14,LANIE>还有勒伤
<2-14,LANIE>And choked,

58
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,540
<2-14,LANIE>脖子一边还插了支铅笔
<2-14,LANIE>and has a pencil jammed in the side of his neck.

59
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,790
<2-15,CASTLE>给"过度杀戮"冠以了的新的定义
<2-15,CASTLE>Ah. Gives new meaning to the term "overkill."

60
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,740
<2-16,BECKETT>有人看到攻击他的人吗
<2-16,BECKETT>Did anyone see his attacker?

61
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,810
<2-17,ESPOSITO>我们在询问目击者
<2-17,ESPOSITO>Uh, we're checking with witnesses,

62
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,090
<2-17,ESPOSITO>但我想凶手应该是趁乱
<2-17,ESPOSITO>but I figure that our perp slipped out of the building

63
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,220
<2-17,ESPOSITO>溜出楼的
<2-17,ESPOSITO>during all the confusion.

64
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,720
<2-18,BECKETT>好  我们去看看他们的进展
<2-18,BECKETT>All right. Let's go see what they got.

65
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,390
<2-19,CASTLE>晚上好  阿丽克西斯
<2-19,CASTLE>Hey, Alexis.

66
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,660
<2-21,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<2-21,CASTLE>Alexis?

67
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,590
<2-22,ALEXIS>老爸
<2-22,ALEXIS>Hey, dad.

68
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,270
<2-23,CASTLE>你在这里干什么
<2-23,CASTLE>What are you doing here?

69
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,120
<2-23,CASTLE>这...
<2-23,CASTLE>Is...

70
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,700
<2-23,CASTLE>这就是你新找的实习
<2-23,CASTLE>is this your new internship?

71
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,720
<2-24,ALEXIS>帕里什医生同意让我跟着她
<2-24,ALEXIS>Dr. Parish agreed to let me shadow her.

72
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,760
<2-24,ALEXIS>我想  如果我要去医学院
<2-24,ALEXIS>I thought, if I go to med school,

73
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,160
<2-24,ALEXIS>这能让我对法医病理学有更清楚的了解
<2-24,ALEXIS>this will give me a better grasp of forensic pathology.

74
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,480
<2-24,ALEXIS>这两天我就学到了很多
<2-24,ALEXIS>I've learned so much in just two days.

75
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,530
<2-25,CASTLE>亲爱的
<2-25,CASTLE>Sweetie...

76
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,770
<2-25,CASTLE>你为什么不告诉我
<2-25,CASTLE>Why wouldn't you tell me?

77
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,500
<2-26,ALEXIS>我想我是怕你不同意
<2-26,ALEXIS>I guess I was afraid you'd veto it,

78
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,380
<2-26,ALEXIS>或许你会觉得我来这里
<2-26,ALEXIS>like maybe you'd think me being here

79
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,000
<2-26,ALEXIS>是在侵犯你的地盘  或者...
<2-26,ALEXIS>was invading your territory or--

80
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,020
<2-27,CASTLE>什么
<2-27,CASTLE>What?

81
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,340
<2-28,CASTLE>太扯了  我怎么可能那么想
<2-28,CASTLE>That's crazy. I wouldn't... think that.

82
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,300
<2-28,CASTLE>真是...
<2-28,CASTLE>That's...

83
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,030
<2-28,CASTLE>这真是太好了
<2-28,CASTLE>This is great.

84
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,590
<2-30,CASTLE>-是啊  -我只是不知
<2-30,CASTLE>- Yeah. - It's--I just--I don't know

85
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
<2-30,CASTLE>让你目睹犯罪现场和死尸会不会不合适
<2-30,CASTLE>if you should be exposed to crime scenes and dead bodies.

86
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,970
<2-31,ALEXIS>我已经习惯了
<2-31,ALEXIS>Oh, I'm already used to it.

87
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,740
<2-31,ALEXIS>虽恶心但也很酷
<2-31,ALEXIS>It's equal parts gross and cool.

88
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,570
<2-32,LANIE>我听到了  我完全赞同你的看法
<2-32,LANIE>I heard that and I couldn't agree with you more.

89
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,750
<2-33,ALEXIS>我终于知道你为什么那么喜欢这个了  老爸
<2-33,ALEXIS>I finally get why you're into this, dad.

90
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,460
<2-33,ALEXIS>现在我也喜欢了
<2-33,ALEXIS>Now I'm into it, too.

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,790
<2-35,CASTLE>太好了
<2-35,CASTLE>That's great.

92
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,910
<2-35,CASTLE>很好
<2-35,CASTLE>Great.

93
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,930
<2-36,CASTLE>我生活的分区相撞了
<2-36,CASTLE>My worlds are colliding.

94
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,370
<2-37,BECKETT>你是指阿丽克西斯
<2-37,BECKETT>You mean Alexis?

95
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,550
<2-38,CASTLE>你知道这事
<2-38,CASTLE>You knew about this?

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
<2-39,BECKETT>得了吧  卡塞尔  是你自己说
<2-39,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. You're the one who said you wanted

97
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,050
<2-39,BECKETT>想找办法和她多待会儿的
<2-39,BECKETT>to find a way of spending more time with her.

98
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,150
<2-40,CASTLE>不是这种方式
<2-40,CASTLE>Not like this.

99
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,510
<2-40,CASTLE>这是我的地盘
<2-40,CASTLE>This is my thing.

100
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,720
<2-40,CASTLE>我们的地盘
<2-40,CASTLE>This is our thing.

101
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,770
<2-40,CASTLE>这是对宗教和国家的侵犯
<2-40,CASTLE>It's a violation of church and state.

102
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,550
<2-41,CASTLE>这就好像我去她学校教书
<2-41,CASTLE>This would be like me just showing up at her school and teaching.

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,940
<2-42,BECKETT>我真的认为你反应有点大
<2-42,BECKETT>I really think that you're overreacting.

104
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,150
<2-43,CASTLE>如果没有呢
<2-43,CASTLE>But what if I'm not?

105
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,980
<2-43,CASTLE>如果这影响了我们微妙的合作关系呢
<2-43,CASTLE>What if this upsets the delicate synergy of our partnership?

106
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,900
<2-43,CASTLE>如果破坏了我们的团队凝聚力呢
<2-43,CASTLE>What if it undermines our unit cohesion?

107
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,360
<2-44,CASTLE>是吧  是个大问题呢
<2-44,CASTLE>See? Major problem.

108
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,320
<2-46,CASTLE>-没说那个  是这个  -地上好多血
<2-46,CASTLE>- Not that. This. - That's a lot of blood.

109
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,610
<2-47,BECKETT>有个目击证人看到一个男人离开大楼
<2-47,BECKETT>One of our witnesses saw a man leaving the building.

110
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,840
<2-47,BECKETT>他一瘸一拐的
<2-47,BECKETT>He was limping.

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,500
<2-48,CASTLE>嫌犯受伤了
<2-48,CASTLE>Our suspect was injured.

112
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,080
<2-49,BECKETT>一路走向那边
<2-49,BECKETT>And the trail goes that way.

113
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,250
<2-50,CASTLE>一个残忍的杀手却被自己身体的脆弱出卖了
<2-50,CASTLE>A brutal killer betrayed by the frailty of his own flesh.

114
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,780
<2-50,CASTLE>原始血迹泄露了他的行踪
<2-50,CASTLE>His path revealed by that most primal stain.

115
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,950
<2-50,CASTLE>但是行迹到此为止
<2-50,CASTLE>Except the path ends here.

116
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,220
<2-51,BECKETT>这么多血只滴在一个地方
<2-51,BECKETT>Multiple drops in one spot?

117
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,400
<2-51,BECKETT>他一定在这里停留过
<2-51,BECKETT>He must have stood here for a minute.

118
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,550
<2-52,CASTLE>他上了车
<2-52,CASTLE>He got into a car.

119
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,070
<2-53,BECKETT>如果他上了车  或许会被录下来
<2-53,BECKETT>Well, if he did, maybe he got caught on tape.

120
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,860
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>第一通报警电话是8点42分打进来的
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>The first 9-1-1 call came at 8:42,

121
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,990
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>就在死者坠楼之后
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>just after our victim crash landed.

122
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,560
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>所以凶手可能就在一两分钟后走到了街角
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>So our guy probably made it to the corner a minute or two later.

123
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,930
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>阿丽克西斯来实习挺不错啊
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Hey. Pretty cool about Alexis' internship.

124
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,480
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>或许不太好
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Or not.

125
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,840
<3-2,BECKETT>看  那个肯定就是他
<3-2,BECKETT>There. That's gotta be him.

126
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,210
<3-3,CASTLE>他受伤了  警察都在追捕他
<3-3,CASTLE>He's wounded, the cops are after him,

127
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,700
<3-3,CASTLE>他在找地方藏身
<3-3,CASTLE>and he's looking for a place to go.

128
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,570
<3-4,BECKETT>他劫了个人质
<3-4,BECKETT>He has a hostage.

129
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,240
<3-4,BECKETT>追踪出租车牌号  查明去向
<3-4,BECKETT>Track the taxi off the medallion number, find out where it went.

130
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,300
<3-4,BECKETT>纽约警察  把手举起来
<3-4,BECKETT>NYPD! Let me see your hands!

131
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,370
<3-4,BECKETT>-纽约警察  把手举起来  -起来
<3-4,BECKETT>- NYPD! Hands in the air. - Get up.

132
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,500
<4-1,BECKETT>把手举起来
<4-1,BECKETT>Show us your hands.

133
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,720
<4-2,BECKETT>起来  把手举起来
<4-2,BECKETT>Get up. Hands in the air.

134
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,330
<4-2,BECKETT>起来  起来
<4-2,BECKETT>Get up. Get up.

135
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,260
<4-3,ESPOSITO>双手抱头
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Put your hands on your head.

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,620
<4-3,ESPOSITO>立即双手抱头
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Hands on your head now.

137
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,560
<4-4,ESPOSITO>跪下
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Drop to your knees.

138
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,130
<4-4,ESPOSITO>托马斯·盖奇
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Thomas Gage.

139
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,300
<5-1,BECKETT>以备查证  我宣读过你的权利吗
<5-1,BECKETT>For the record, have I advised you of your rights?

140
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,030
<5-2,THOMAS GAGE>读了
<5-2,THOMAS GAGE>Yes.

141
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,540
<5-3,BECKETT>包括你请律师的权利
<5-3,BECKETT>Including your right to an attorney?

142
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,890
<5-4,GAGE>我不需要
<5-4,GAGE>I won't need one.

143
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,130
<5-5,BECKETT>你认识这个人吗
<5-5,BECKETT>Do you recognize this man?

144
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,250
<5-6,GAGE>看来他摔得很惨
<5-6,GAGE>Looks like he took a nasty fall.

145
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,820
<5-7,BECKETT>是有人推了他一把
<5-7,BECKETT>Well, he had a little help.

146
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,560
<5-7,BECKETT>指纹能证明他是被人扔出窗外
<5-7,BECKETT>Fingerprint evidence will show that he was thrown out a window

147
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,730
<5-7,BECKETT>被你扔出窗外
<5-7,BECKETT>by you.

148
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,070
<5-8,CASTLE>事后
<5-8,CASTLE>After which,

149
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,550
<5-8,CASTLE>监控摄像头将你绑架蒂娜·马赛的过程尽收眼底
<5-8,CASTLE>you kidnapped Tina Massey in full view of a security camera.

150
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,850
<5-9,BECKETT>杀人  外加绑架
<5-9,BECKETT>Murder, plus kidnapping,

151
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,270
<5-9,BECKETT>你得死在大牢里了
<5-9,BECKETT>that equals more years in prison than you have left.

152
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,570
<5-9,BECKETT>除非你肯合作
<5-9,BECKETT>Unless you cooperate.

153
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,480
<5-10,GAGE>你们掌握的有关我的证据
<5-10,GAGE>Everything that you have on me...

154
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,830
<5-10,GAGE>或是你们以为有的证据
<5-10,GAGE>Or you think you have...

155
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,230
<5-10,GAGE>都会消失无踪
<5-10,GAGE>It's all going away.

156
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,960
<5-10,GAGE>我说完了
<5-10,GAGE>And we're done here.

157
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,470
<6-1,BECKETT>这家伙应该吓得汗如雨下
<6-1,BECKETT>This guy should be sweating bullets.

158
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,890
<6-1,BECKETT>感觉很不对
<6-1,BECKETT>This doesn't feel right.

159
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,420
<6-2,CASTLE>就好像他知道我们不知道的事
<6-2,CASTLE>It's like he knows something we don't.

160
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,070
<6-3,BECKETT>尽力去查出托马斯·盖奇的所有资料
<6-3,BECKETT>I want you to pull everything you can on Thomas Gage.

161
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,020
<6-4,RYAN>问题是  这不是他的真名
<6-4,RYAN>The problem is, that's not his real name.

162
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,410
<6-4,RYAN>他的驾照是伪造的
<6-4,RYAN>His driver's license is bogus,

163
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,770
<6-4,RYAN>系统里也没他的指纹
<6-4,RYAN>and his prints aren't in the system.

164
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,660
<6-4,RYAN>总之  我们对此人一无所知
<6-4,RYAN>Bottom line is, we have no idea who this man is.

165
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,010
<7-1,TINA>整个过程中他一直非常冷静
<7-1,TINA>The guy was super calm the whole time.

166
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,700
<7-1,TINA>话也不多
<7-1,TINA>Not big on chitchat either.

167
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,890
<7-1,TINA>他的开场白是
<7-1,TINA>His opening line was,

168
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,680
<7-1,TINA>"滚进出租车  不然就毙了你"
<7-1,TINA>"Get your ass in the cab, or I'll kill you."

169
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,360
<7-2,BECKETT>那你们回到你的公寓之后呢
<7-2,BECKETT>And what about when you went back to your apartment,

170
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,240
<7-2,BECKETT>他说什么了
<7-2,BECKETT>what did he talk about?

171
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,850
<7-3,TINA>他保证会留我一命之后
<7-3,TINA>After he promised not to murder me,

172
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,560
<7-3,TINA>就让我包扎他的腿
<7-3,TINA>he asked me to patch up his leg.

173
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,070
<7-3,TINA>他腿上有条很深的伤口
<7-3,TINA>He had a real gash.

174
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,010
<7-4,BECKETT>你能看出来他是怎么伤的吗
<7-4,BECKETT>Could you tell how he got the injury?

175
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,800
<7-5,TINA>他说他在行凶杀人时
<7-5,TINA>He said he got slashed with a knife

176
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,800
<7-5,TINA>被对方用刀砍伤
<7-5,TINA>while he was killing a guy.

177
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,760
<7-6,BECKETT>他就这么供认不讳
<7-6,BECKETT>And he admitted that to you?

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,470
<7-7,TINA>更像是陈述事实
<7-7,TINA>More like just made the statement.

179
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,310
<7-8,CASTLE>他有没有说那人是谁
<7-8,CASTLE>And did he say who this guy was

180
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,810
<7-8,CASTLE>或者他为什么杀他
<7-8,CASTLE>or why he killed him?

181
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,710
<7-9,TINA>他就只跟我说  这个人不存在
<7-9,TINA>All he told me was that the man doesn't exist.

182
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,200
<7-9,TINA>这个人不存在
<7-9,TINA>The man doesn't exist

183
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,530
<8-1,LANIE>至少我查不到
<8-1,LANIE>as far as I can tell.

184
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,880
<8-2,BECKETT>那你还没查到他的身份
<8-2,BECKETT>So you haven't I.D.'ed him yet?

185
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,600
<8-3,LANIE>我试了  但所有数据库都查不到他的指纹
<8-3,LANIE>Look, I'm trying, but his fingerprints aren't in any database,

186
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,180
<8-3,LANIE>这点很奇怪
<8-3,LANIE>which is weird,

187
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,220
<8-3,LANIE>因为我以为他一定会有犯罪记录呢
<8-3,LANIE>because I thought for sure he'd have a criminal record.

188
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,910
<8-4,CASTLE>为什么
<8-4,CASTLE>How come?

189
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,740
<8-5,LANIE>他不是第一次身负多伤了
<8-5,LANIE>It's not the first time this guy has mixed it up--

190
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,920
<8-5,LANIE>身上有多处旧枪伤
<8-5,LANIE>old gunshot wounds,

191
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,750
<8-5,LANIE>手上有习武结下的厚茧
<8-5,LANIE>callused hands from martial arts training,

192
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,610
<8-5,LANIE>断过的骨头比柯受良还多
<8-5,LANIE>more broken bones than Evel Knievel.

193
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,290
<8-5,LANIE>看他拍的片子吓死你
<8-5,LANIE>You're not gonna believe his x-rays.

194
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,310
<8-6,LANIE>我的无名尸哪去了
<8-6,LANIE>Where is my John Doe?

195
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,330
<8-6,LANIE>尸体呢
<8-6,LANIE>Where is my John Doe?

196
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,080
<8-8,ALEXIS>我走的时候还在这儿呢
<8-8,ALEXIS>He was right there when I left.

197
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,610
<8-8,ALEXIS>我就出去了一小会
<8-8,ALEXIS>I-I was only gone a minute.

198
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,200
<8-9,LANIE>我知道他刚刚还在
<8-9,LANIE>I know he was right there.

199
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,940
<8-9,LANIE>我正打算给他开膛破肚呢
<8-9,LANIE>I was just about to cut him open.

200
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,030
<8-10,CASTLE>现在他可真是不存在了
<8-10,CASTLE>Well, now he really doesn't exist.

201
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,850
<9-1,BECKETT>一具尸体怎么会从停尸间里凭空消失呢
<9-1,BECKETT>How does a body just vanish from a morgue?

202
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,170
<9-2,CASTLE>不知道  但托马斯·盖奇有这个本事
<9-2,CASTLE>I don't know, but Thomas Gage does.

203
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,940
<9-2,CASTLE>还记得他曾说过
<9-2,CASTLE>Remember what he said--

204
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,710
<9-2,CASTLE>你以为你掌握的证据都会消失无踪
<9-2,CASTLE>Whatever you think you have is going away?

205
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,210
<9-2,CASTLE>这事他也有份
<9-2,CASTLE>He's in on this.

206
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,470
<9-3,BECKETT>埃斯波  盖奇转移去扣押中心了吗
<9-3,BECKETT>Espo, did Gage get transferred to Central Booking yet?

207
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,670
<9-4,ESPOSITO>没  他还关在我们这儿
<9-4,ESPOSITO>No, he's still in holding.

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,100
<9-5,BECKETT>他得给我们老实交代
<9-5,BECKETT>He's gonna give us some answers.

209
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,480
<10-1,BECKETT>他跑哪去了
<10-1,BECKETT>Where the hell is this guy?

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,250
<10-2,ESPOSITO>之前还在  我
<10-2,ESPOSITO>He was here. I-I--

211
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,700
<10-2,ESPOSITO>我亲自锁的他
<10-2,ESPOSITO>I secured him myself.

212
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,990
<10-3,BECKETT>封锁分局
<10-3,BECKETT>Lock down the precinct.

213
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,060
<10-3,BECKETT>好的  马上
<10-3,BECKETT>All right. Move.

215
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,820
<10-3,BECKETT>老爸
<10-3,BECKETT>Hey, Dad.

216
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,200
<11-1,ALEXIS>我昨晚想等你来着  但你回来得好晚
<11-1,ALEXIS>I tried to wait up, but you must have gotten in really late.

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,800
<11-2,CASTLE>身不由己啊  嫌犯离奇失踪
<11-2,CASTLE>Not by choice. Our suspect pulled a Houdini,

218
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,090
<11-2,CASTLE>所以他们封锁了整个警局
<11-2,CASTLE>so they locked down the entire station.

219
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,150
<11-2,CASTLE>但那时  化名为托马斯·盖奇的
<11-2,CASTLE>But by then, the mysterious steely killer,

220
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,730
<11-2,CASTLE>神秘的冷血杀手
<11-2,CASTLE>going by the nom de guerre of Thomas Gage,

221
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,240
<11-2,CASTLE>早就不知所踪了
<11-2,CASTLE>was long gone.

222
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,510
<11-2,CASTLE>我要给这案子做笔记
<11-2,CASTLE>I'm writing up notes on this case.

223
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,310
<11-2,CASTLE>这可是我下本书的绝佳题材啊
<11-2,CASTLE>Solid-gold material for my next book.

224
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,330
<11-3,ALEXIS>等等  那个把无名氏扔出窗外的人吗
<11-3,ALEXIS>Wait. The guy who threw John Doe out the window,

225
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:06,830
<11-3,ALEXIS>他逃走了
<11-3,ALEXIS>he escaped?

226
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,290
<11-4,CASTLE>不过那是在他
<11-4,CASTLE>Uh-huh, but only after

227
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,500
<11-4,CASTLE>精心策划将无名尸偷出停尸间之后
<11-4,CASTLE>orchestrating the theft of John Doe's body from the morgue.

228
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,750
<11-4,CASTLE>这个情节多妙啊
<11-4,CASTLE>How awesome is that?

229
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,870
<11-5,ALEXIS>对那个失职让尸体被窃的人不怎么妙
<11-5,ALEXIS>Not so awesome if you're the person who let it happen.

230
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,140
<11-6,CASTLE>宝贝  不是你的责任
<11-6,CASTLE>Oh, honey, it's not your fault.

231
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,310
<11-7,ALEXIS>当时我守着尸体  一个朋友来电话
<11-7,ALEXIS>I was with that body, but a friend called,

232
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,730
<11-7,ALEXIS>我就去一边聊天了  我没
<11-7,ALEXIS>and I stepped away to talk. I didn't--

233
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,830
<11-8,CASTLE>好了  先听我说
<11-8,CASTLE>Okay, hang on. Listen to me.

234
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,070
<11-8,CASTLE>我很欣慰你当时不在
<11-8,CASTLE>I'm glad you weren't there

235
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,730
<11-8,CASTLE>因为会偷走尸体的人
<11-8,CASTLE>because the kind of person who took John Doe's body

236
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,720
<11-8,CASTLE>肯定也会毫不犹豫地
<11-8,CASTLE>is the kind of person who wouldn't think twice

237
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,420
<11-8,CASTLE>对妨碍他的人痛下杀手
<11-8,CASTLE>about hurting whoever got in the way.

238
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,520
<11-9,ALEXIS>我还以为跟法医一起工作
<11-9,ALEXIS>Still, I thought working with Dr. Parish,

239
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,210
<11-9,ALEXIS>绝对不会发生由于我的失误
<11-9,ALEXIS>there'd be zero chance I'd make a mistake

240
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,430
<11-9,ALEXIS>而影响到病人的事件
<11-9,ALEXIS>that would affect a patient.

241
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,510
<11-9,ALEXIS>毕竟  这怎么可能呢
<11-9,ALEXIS>I mean, how could I, right?

242
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,060
<11-9,ALEXIS>可我还是搞砸了
<11-9,ALEXIS>Well, I found a way.

243
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,210
<11-10,CASTLE>宝贝  知道吗
<11-10,CASTLE>Y-you know, honey,

244
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,720
<11-10,CASTLE>如果这份实习的工作不那么合适的话
<11-10,CASTLE>if this internship isn't the right fit,

245
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,300
<11-10,CASTLE>我相信蕾妮会谅解的
<11-10,CASTLE>I'm sure Lanie would understand.

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,170
<11-10,CASTLE>不行
<11-10,CASTLE>No.

247
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,240
<11-11,ALEXIS>既然帕里什医生给了我这个机会
<11-11,ALEXIS>Dr. Parish gave me this opportunity,

248
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,700
<11-11,ALEXIS>我就不能半途而废
<11-11,ALEXIS>and I want to see it through.

249
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,210
<12-1,VICTORA GATES>如何
<12-1,VICTORA GATES>Well?

250
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,860
<12-2,RYAN>我们认为无名氏遇害的公寓
<12-2,RYAN>The apartment where John Doe was killed,

251
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,430
<12-2,RYAN>是托马斯·盖奇之前居住的地方
<12-2,RYAN>we think thomas gage was squatting there.

252
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,950
<12-3,GATES>-结果  -我不管盖奇曾经住在哪
<12-3,GATES>- Turns-- - I don't care where Gage was

253
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,100
<12-3,GATES>除非这能告诉我他现在在哪
<12-3,GATES>unless it tells me where he is now.

254
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,770
<12-3,GATES>但我也很想知道
<12-3,GATES>But I'm very interested in knowing

255
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,100
<12-3,GATES>他是怎么在你们眼皮子底下从牢房溜出去的
<12-3,GATES>how he got out of that holding cell on your watch.

256
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,630
<12-4,ESPOSITO>长官  目前我们也不清楚
<12-4,ESPOSITO>We're not clear on that, Sir.

257
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,840
<12-4,ESPOSITO>但我们知道他是怎么离开分局的
<12-4,ESPOSITO>But we do know how he left this precinct.

258
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,760
<12-5,GATES>我猜他是从后门偷溜的
<12-5,GATES>I assume he snuck out of the back exit.

259
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,990
<12-6,RYAN>其实他是从正门大摇大摆出去的
<12-6,RYAN>Actually, he went out through the front door.

260
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,050
<12-6,RYAN>这张照片是他往大堂走时拍下的
<12-6,RYAN>This is him heading to the lobby.

261
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,390
<12-7,GATES>他从哪弄到的警服
<12-7,GATES>Where did this man get a uniform?

262
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,740
<12-8,RYAN>从更衣室偷的
<12-8,RYAN>He stole it from the locker room.

263
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,450
<12-9,GATES>查查他还干了什么
<12-9,GATES>Find out what else he did.

264
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,020
<12-9,GATES>去查监控录像  追查他的一举一动
<12-9,GATES>Check our security video and retrace his steps.

265
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,850
<12-9,GATES>我要知道他都做了什么
<12-9,GATES>I want to know every move that he made.

266
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,720
<12-10,ESPOSITO>遵命
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Okay.

267
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,700
<13-1,BECKETT>盖奇总是走在我们前面
<13-1,BECKETT>Gage has been two steps ahead of us this whole time.

268
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,530
<13-2,CASTLE>不仅如此  他一定还有其他同伙
<13-2,CASTLE>Not only that, but he must have a partner

269
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,030
<13-2,CASTLE>才能从停尸间把尸体偷走
<13-2,CASTLE>who took John Doe from the morgue.

270
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,770
<13-3,BECKETT>这些还是解释不了他为什么要穿上警服
<13-3,BECKETT>Which still doesn't explain why he ended up wearing those blues.

271
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,980
<13-3,BECKETT>何必冒险偷警服呢
<13-3,BECKETT>Why risk stealing a uniform

272
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,830
<13-3,BECKETT>他明明可以就那么走出警局
<13-3,BECKETT>when he could've just walked out of the building?

273
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,620
<13-4,RYAN>我知道原因  因为他要在分局里找些东西
<13-4,RYAN>I'll tell you why. He needed something inside our precinct.

274
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,440
<13-4,RYAN>他入侵了我们的数据库
<13-4,RYAN>The guy got into our database.

275
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,970
<13-5,BECKETT>-找什么东西  -不是找东西
<13-5,BECKETT>- Looking for what? - Not what.

276
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,190
<13-6,ESPOSITO>而是找人
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Who.

277
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,620
<13-7,ESPOSITO>皇后区的特雷西·麦格拉
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Tracy McGrath of Queens.

278
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,950
<13-7,ESPOSITO>他搜索了她  我想我知道他找什么
<13-7,ESPOSITO>He ran her name, and I think I know why.

279
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,360
<13-7,ESPOSITO>她的住址没登记
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Her address is unlisted.

280
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,220
<13-8,CASTLE>如果落网只是盖奇计划的一部分呢
<13-8,CASTLE>What if getting arrested was part of Gage's plan?

281
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,120
<13-8,CASTLE>这样他就可以入侵数据库查到特雷西的地址了
<13-8,CASTLE>So he could access our data for Tracy's address.

282
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,700
<13-9,BECKETT>伙计们  尽力搜索有关特雷西的资料
<13-9,BECKETT>All right, you guys pull up everything you can on Tracy.

283
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,150
<13-9,BECKETT>我跟卡塞尔这就去看看
<13-9,BECKETT>Castle and I will go over there now.

284
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,040
<13-9,BECKETT>好
<13-9,BECKETT>Okay.

285
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,430
<14-1,BECKETT>她的手机直接转到语音信箱了
<14-1,BECKETT>Her phone's going straight to voice mail.

286
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,950
<14-2,CASTLE>她跟这一切有什么关联
<14-2,CASTLE>What is her connection to all this?

287
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,630
<14-2,CASTLE>盖奇为何对她这么有兴趣
<14-2,CASTLE>Why is Gage so interested in her?

288
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,000
<14-3,BECKETT>如果幸运  她或许知道盖奇的真实身份
<14-3,BECKETT>With any luck, she knows who Gage really is.

289
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,550
<14-4,BECKETT>特雷西·麦格拉
<14-4,BECKETT>Tracy McGrath?

290
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,600
<14-4,BECKETT>纽约警局
<14-4,BECKETT>NYPD.

291
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,710
<14-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<14-5,BECKETT>Castle.

292
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,810
<14-6,BECKETT>埃斯波  我们来晚了
<14-6,BECKETT>Espo, yeah, we got here too late.

293
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,690
<14-6,BECKETT>她后脑中了一枪
<14-6,BECKETT>Uh, she's got one to the back of the head.

294
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,980
<14-6,BECKETT>你通知一下蕾妮  让她把鉴证组也带来
<14-6,BECKETT>Can you call Lanie and get her to bring C.S.U. down here?

295
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,790
<15-1,ESPOSITO>好  我着手办
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Yeah. I'm on it.

296
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,560
<15-2,ESPOSITO>盖茨警监
<15-2,ESPOSITO>Captain Gates,

297
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,730
<15-2,ESPOSITO>特雷西·麦格拉也被盖奇杀害了
<15-2,ESPOSITO>looks like Tracy McGRrath was Gage's next victim.

298
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,830
<15-3,GATES>我们掌握她什么情况
<15-3,GATES>What do we know about her?

299
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,620
<15-4,RYAN>她33岁  没有亲人
<15-4,RYAN>Well, she's 33, no family.

300
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,490
<15-4,RYAN>是研究基金会的一位科学家
<15-4,RYAN>A scientist at a research foundation.

301
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,130
<15-5,GATES>好  找她的同事问话
<15-5,GATES>All right. Talk to her coworkers.

302
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,170
<15-5,GATES>查明盖奇为什么要置她于死地
<15-5,GATES>Find out why Gage would've wanted her dead.

303
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,830
<16-1,CASTLE>看来她死了有一阵子了
<16-1,CASTLE>Looks like she's been here a while.

304
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,410
<16-2,BECKETT>这一点也不稀奇
<16-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, it makes sense.

305
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,870
<16-2,BECKETT>盖奇昨晚就逃跑了
<16-2,BECKETT>Gage escaped last night.

306
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,420
<16-2,BECKETT>动作比我们快了10个小时
<16-2,BECKETT>He had a 10-hour lead on us.

307
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,110
<16-2,BECKETT>你留在原地
<16-2,BECKETT>You stay put.

308
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,680
<16-2,BECKETT>我去看看屋里其他地方
<16-2,BECKETT>I'm gonna check the rest of the place.

309
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,510
<16-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<16-2,BECKETT>Castle...

310
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,290
<17-1,ALEXIS>人都去哪了
<17-1,ALEXIS>Where is everybody?

311
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,540
<17-2,LANIE>我们通常会先于警员到达现场
<17-2,LANIE>We usually beat the uniforms to the scenes.

312
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,920
<17-2,LANIE>他们总不想急匆匆地来然后傻站着
<17-2,LANIE>It's not like they want to hurry and stand around.

313
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,620
<17-3,ALEXIS>这次我不会让死者再离开我的视线了
<17-3,ALEXIS>Just so you know, I'm not letting this victim out of my sight.

314
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,510
<17-5,ALEXIS>-真荒唐  -怎么了
<17-5,ALEXIS>- Crazy. - What is?

315
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,920
<17-6,LANIE>像理查德·卡塞尔那样
<17-6,LANIE>The fact that Richard Castle,

316
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,890
<17-6,LANIE>从不会内疚自责的人
<17-6,LANIE>a man unburdened by regret and guilt,

317
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,090
<17-6,LANIE>怎么会有一个责任心这么强的女儿
<17-6,LANIE>has a child that carries the weight of the world.

318
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,950
<17-6,LANIE>那具尸体消失了不是你的责任
<17-6,LANIE>It is not on you that a dead man came up missing.

319
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,530
<17-7,ALEXIS>那样的事多久发生一次
<17-7,ALEXIS>Well, how often does something like that happen anyway?

320
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,680
<17-8,LANIE>从未发生过  所以别担心  这事很怪
<17-8,LANIE>It never happens, honey. So relax. It was a freak thing.

321
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,450
<17-8,LANIE>尸体不会不翼而飞的
<17-8,LANIE>Bodies just don't disappear.

322
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,790
<17-9,LANIE>贝克特探长
<17-9,LANIE>Detective Beckett?

323
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,620
<17-9,LANIE>贝克特探长
<17-9,LANIE>Detective Beckett.

324
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,450
<17-10,LANIE>好吧  我看见血迹了
<17-10,LANIE>Okay, I see where the blood stain is.

325
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,200
<17-11,ALEXIS>尸体呢
<17-11,ALEXIS>Where is the body?

326
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,110
<18-1,CASTLE>你没事吧
<18-1,CASTLE>You okay?

327
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,170
<18-2,BECKETT>没事  你呢
<18-2,BECKETT>Yeah. You?

328
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
<18-3,CASTLE>你是什么人
<18-3,CASTLE>Who are you?

329
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,540
<18-4,BECKETT>要带我们去哪里
<18-4,BECKETT>Where the hell are you taking us?

330
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,960
<18-5,CASTLE>无论是哪儿
<18-5,CASTLE>Wherever it is...

331
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,390
<18-5,CASTLE>是在地下很深处
<18-5,CASTLE>It's way down.

332
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,070
<18-6,BECKETT>这究竟是什么地方
<18-6,BECKETT>What is this place?

333
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,780
<18-7,CASTLE>不知道  一头雾水
<18-7,CASTLE>I don't know. I have no idea.

334
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,440
<18-8,SOPHIA TURNER>里克·卡塞尔也有词穷的时候
<18-8,SOPHIA TURNER>Rick Castle at a loss for words?

335
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,600
<18-8,SOPHIA TURNER>破天荒头一遭吧
<18-8,SOPHIA TURNER>That must be a first for you.

336
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,450
<18-9,CASTLE>索菲亚·特纳
<18-9,CASTLE>Sophia Turner?

337
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,080
<18-10,SOPHIA>你好  里克
<18-10,SOPHIA>Hello, Rick.

338
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,450
<18-10,SOPHIA>欢迎来到中情局
<18-10,SOPHIA>Welcome to the CIA.

339
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,670
<18-10,SOPHIA>对  是她
<18-10,SOPHIA>Yeah, that's her.

340
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,080
<18-10,SOPHIA>特雷西已经在牛顿基金会为我工作五年了
<18-10,SOPHIA>Tracy's worked for me at the Newton foundation for five years.

341
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,960
<18-10,SOPHIA>昨天我还和她说过话
<18-10,SOPHIA>I just talked to her yesterday.

342
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,600
<18-10,SOPHIA>我们争论雪佛兰古董车的优点
<18-10,SOPHIA>We debated the merits of the Chevy Corvair.

343
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,080
<18-10,SOPHIA>她喜欢古典车
<18-10,SOPHIA>She's a classic car buff.

344
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,850
<18-10,SOPHIA>生前喜欢
<18-10,SOPHIA>She was.

345
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,370
<19-1,RYAN>特雷西到底负责什么工作
<19-1,RYAN>And what kind of work did Tracy do exactly?

346
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,410
<23-1,BECKETT>不会招来杀身之祸的工作  你是这意思吗
<23-1,BECKETT>It wouldn't get you killed, if that's what you're asking.

347
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,280
<23-2,CASTLE>特雷西拥有应用数学的博士学位
<23-2,CASTLE>Tracy had a PhD in applied mathematics.

348
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,370
<23-2,CASTLE>她研发统计模型
<23-2,CASTLE>She'd been developing statistical models

349
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,530
<23-2,CASTLE>以预测气候变化的影响
<23-2,CASTLE>to predict the affects of climate change.

350
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,980
<19-1,RYAN>她有树敌吗
<19-1,RYAN>Did she have any enemies,

351
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,570
<19-2,ESPOSITO>有没有人会对她不利
<19-2,ESPOSITO>anybody who might want to do her harm?

352
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,810
<21-13,SOPHIA>就我所知没有
<21-13,SOPHIA>None that I know of.

353
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,230
<21-14,BECKETT>等等
<21-14,BECKETT>Hold on.

354
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,920
<21-15,ESPOSITO>昨天有件奇怪事
<21-15,ESPOSITO>There was something, yesterday.

355
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,940
<21-16,BECKETT>她大概下午三点突然离开办公室
<21-16,BECKETT>Uh, she left the office rather suddenly, about 3:00.

356
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,860
<21-17,ESPOSITO>她没跟我打招呼  就那么消失了两个小时
<21-17,ESPOSITO>She didn't check in with me. She was just gone for two hours.

357
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,760
<21-17,ESPOSITO>那可不是她的风格
<21-17,ESPOSITO>That wasn't like her.

358
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,930
<21-17,ESPOSITO>你知道她去了哪里吗
<21-17,ESPOSITO>Do you have any idea where she went?

359
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,370
<19-1,RYAN>不知道  我问她时
<19-1,RYAN>No, and when I asked,

360
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,220
<19-2,ESPOSITO>她似乎不想说
<19-2,ESPOSITO>she didn't seem to want to tell me.

361
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,250
<19-3,RYAN>我们要查看她的电脑
<19-3,RYAN>We're gonna need access to her computer,

362
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,220
<19-4,ESPOSITO>电邮  文档等一切资料
<19-4,ESPOSITO>her e-mails, her documents, everything.

363
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,820
<19-4,ESPOSITO>全在我们的服务器里
<19-4,ESPOSITO>It's all on our server.

364
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,090
<19-4,ESPOSITO>我在这里就可以登录
<19-4,ESPOSITO>I can log into there from here.

365
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,870
<20-1,CASTLE>秘密地下总部
<20-1,CASTLE>Secret underground headquarters?

366
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,790
<20-1,CASTLE>和007电影有得一拼
<20-1,CASTLE>This is straight out of James Bond.

367
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,550
<20-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在回避问题
<20-2,BECKETT>Castle, you're avoiding the question.

368
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,920
<20-2,BECKETT>索菲亚·特纳是什么人  你怎么认识她的
<20-2,BECKETT>Who's Sophia Turner? How do you know her?

369
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,170
<20-3,CASTLE>说来话长
<20-3,CASTLE>Uh, it's a... long story.

370
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,660
<20-4,BECKETT>那你就长话短说吧
<20-4,BECKETT>Well, I'll take the short version.

371
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,030
<20-5,SOPHIA>还是我来揭谜底吧
<20-5,SOPHIA>Let me give it to you.

372
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,460
<20-5,SOPHIA>已经有
<20-5,SOPHIA>What has it been,

373
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,590
<20-6,SOPHIA>十二年了吧
<20-6,SOPHIA>12 years?

374
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,720
<20-7,CASTLE>十一年半
<20-7,CASTLE>11 and a half.

375
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,160
<20-8,SOPHIA>我们是里克为他的第一本德里克·斯道姆小说
<20-8,SOPHIA>Rick and I met when he was just beginning to do research

376
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,050
<20-8,SOPHIA>做调研的时认识的
<20-8,SOPHIA>on his first Derrick Storm novel.

377
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,630
<20-8,SOPHIA>他想近距离亲身观察
<20-8,SOPHIA>He wanted an up-close-and-personal look

378
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,580
<20-8,SOPHIA>中情局女特工的生活
<20-8,SOPHIA>at the life of a female CIA agent.

379
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,140
<20-8,SOPHIA>所以我就让他如愿了
<20-8,SOPHIA>So I gave him one.

380
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,740
<20-9,BECKETT>你就是克莱拉·斯瑞克
<20-9,BECKETT>You're Clara Strike,

381
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,370
<20-9,BECKETT>德里克·斯道姆系列小说里的克莱拉·斯瑞克
<20-9,BECKETT>the Clara Strike from the Derrick Storm books?

382
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,620
<20-10,SOPHIA>我不敢肯定自己就是克莱拉·斯瑞克
<20-10,SOPHIA>I wouldn't say that I am Clara Strike,

383
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,120
<20-10,SOPHIA>但我想我还是给了里克一些灵感
<20-10,SOPHIA>but I'd like to think that I inspired Rick in some small way.

384
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,390
<20-11,BECKETT>真是太有意思了
<20-11,BECKETT>Well, that is just fascinating.

385
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,030
<20-12,SOPHIA>-气色不错呀  -你也是
<20-12,SOPHIA>- You look good. - You, too.

386
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,050
<20-13,CASTLE>我不想打扰你们老友重聚
<20-13,CASTLE>Okay, so I hate to interrupt this reunion,

387
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,540
<20-14,BECKETT>但是我们被非法扣留了
<20-14,BECKETT>but we're being illegally detained,

388
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,820
<20-14,BECKETT>至少我是不情愿的
<20-14,BECKETT>at least I am.

389
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,380
<20-15,SOPHIA>不是扣留
<20-15,SOPHIA>This is not a detention.

390
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,240
<20-15,SOPHIA>而是任务报告  纽约警局批准的
<20-15,SOPHIA>This is a debriefing, approved by the NYPD.

391
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,360
<20-15,SOPHIA>欢迎打给泰德·麦奎因核实
<20-15,SOPHIA>Feel free to call Ted McQuinn.

392
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,890
<20-16,BECKETT>你是说警部
<20-16,BECKETT>The chief of detectives?

393
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,180
<20-17,SOPHIA>他向我保证你会全力配合
<20-17,SOPHIA>He assured me you'd give us your full cooperation.

394
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,540
<20-17,SOPHIA>请告诉我你掌握的托马斯·盖奇的一切情况
<20-17,SOPHIA>I need to know everything you know about Thomas Gage.

395
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,540
<20-18,BECKETT>不  你得先跟我说清楚到底是什么情况
<20-18,BECKETT>No. Not until you tell me what the hell is going on here.

396
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,660
<20-18,BECKETT>好吧
<20-18,BECKETT>Fine.

397
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,280
<20-19,SOPHIA>不过这会涉及到
<20-19,SOPHIA>But that would be getting into

398
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,020
<20-19,SOPHIA>事关国家安全的高度机密
<20-19,SOPHIA>highly classified information regarding national security,

399
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,810
<20-19,SOPHIA>如果你泄露此机密
<20-19,SOPHIA>which, if you were to reveal it to anyone,

400
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,370
<20-19,SOPHIA>将被裁定为
<20-19,SOPHIA>would be considered a treasonable offense

401
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,160
<20-19,SOPHIA>叛国罪
<20-19,SOPHIA>against the United States of America,

402
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,710
<20-19,SOPHIA>并会被判处死刑
<20-19,SOPHIA>punishable by death.

403
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,070
<20-19,SOPHIA>那么  你还想知道吗
<20-19,SOPHIA>So... you still want to know?

404
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,730
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>托马斯·盖奇于97年从海豹突击第6分队招至麾下
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>We recruited Thomas Gage out of seal team six in 1997.

405
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,170
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>机智  训练有素  精通11种语言
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>Smart, highly trained, fluent in 11 languages,

406
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,440
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>他曾是我们的王牌特工
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>Gage was our most effective asset.

407
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,780
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>我们派他去世界各地的冲突地区和国家
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>We sent him into conflict zones, failed states all over the world.

408
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,800
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>盖奇能处理好任何情况
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>Gage was adept in every situation.

409
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,840
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>不幸的是  他变节了
<21-1,MARTIN DANBERG>Unfortunately, he went rogue.

410
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,350
<21-2,SOPHIA>根据国家安全局拦截的情报
<21-2,SOPHIA>Based on N.S.A. intercepts,

411
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,320
<21-2,SOPHIA>我们相信盖奇试图发动一起灾难性事件
<21-2,SOPHIA>we believe that Gage is trying to initiate a catastrophic event,

412
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,490
<21-2,SOPHIA>这对国家安全构成紧迫威胁
<21-2,SOPHIA>which poses an imminent threat to the country.

413
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,310
<21-2,SOPHIA>这么说
<21-2,SOPHIA>So...

414
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:55,960
<21-3,CASTLE>被盖奇推出窗外的男子  是中情局特工
<21-3,CASTLE>That man that Gage pushed out the window, he was CIA.

415
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,640
<21-4,SOPHIA>加里·哈勃  顶尖特工之一
<21-4,SOPHIA>Gary Harper. One of our best.

416
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,240
<21-4,SOPHIA>我们掌握了盖奇的踪迹
<21-4,SOPHIA>We got a tip on Gage's whereabouts.

417
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,630
<21-4,SOPHIA>派哈勃将其逮捕
<21-4,SOPHIA>We sent Harper to bring him in.

418
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,170
<21-4,SOPHIA>显然  行动失败了
<21-4,SOPHIA>Obviously, that operation didn't go as planned.

419
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,280
<21-5,CASTLE>之后  是你们从停尸间偷走了尸体
<21-5,CASTLE>At which point, you took the body from the morgue.

420
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,930
<21-6,DANBERG>这可是国家安全危机
<21-6,DANBERG>This is a national security crisis.

421
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,260
<21-6,DANBERG>我们可不希望纽约警局碍手碍脚
<21-6,DANBERG>We didn't want the NYPD underfoot.

422
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,330
<21-7,BECKETT>很高兴知道这点
<21-7,BECKETT>Well, good to know.

423
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,340
<21-7,BECKETT>你们是怎么调查到特雷西·麦格拉的
<21-7,BECKETT>So how did you guys get on to Tracy McGrath?

424
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,350
<21-8,SOPHIA>我们监控了你们分局的数据
<21-8,SOPHIA>We monitored data from your precinct.

425
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,850
<21-8,SOPHIA>发现了此人  但不幸的是
<21-8,SOPHIA>Her name came up, but unfortunately,

426
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,030
<21-8,SOPHIA>特工赶到时  她已经遇害了
<21-8,SOPHIA>by the time our agent got there, she was already dead.

427
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,360
<21-9,CASTLE>盖奇为什么要杀她
<21-9,CASTLE>So why did Gage kill her?

428
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,940
<21-10,SOPHIA>我们希望你知道呢
<21-10,SOPHIA>We were hoping you would know.

429
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,280
<21-11,SOPHIA>你可以接电话
<21-11,SOPHIA>You can go ahead and answer that.

430
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,590
<21-12,BECKETT>我没打算不接
<21-12,BECKETT>Yeah, I was planning on it.

431
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,990
<21-13,SOPHIA>介意用免提接听吗
<21-13,SOPHIA>Would you mind terribly putting it on speaker?

432
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,370
<21-14,BECKETT>埃斯波  免提开着
<21-14,BECKETT>Espo, you're on speaker.

433
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,350
<21-15,ESPOSITO>警部发下话来
<21-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, so, word came down from chief of D's.

434
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,950
<21-15,ESPOSITO>他说你在实行什么特殊任务
<21-15,ESPOSITO>He said you were on some kind of special assignment.

435
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,000
<21-15,ESPOSITO>这是怎么回事
<21-15,ESPOSITO>What's that about?

436
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,800
<21-15,ESPOSITO>说来话长
<21-15,ESPOSITO>Uh, it's a long story.

437
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,530
<21-16,BECKETT>特雷西·麦格拉方面有什么进展
<21-16,BECKETT>What do you got on Tracy McGrath?

438
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,330
<21-17,ESPOSITO>可能与案子无关
<21-17,ESPOSITO>It may be nothing,

439
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,170
<21-17,ESPOSITO>她昨天曾翘班两个小时
<21-17,ESPOSITO>but she ditched work yesterday for two hours.

440
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,730
<21-17,ESPOSITO>她的日程安排上作了记号
<21-17,ESPOSITO>She has a notation in her day planner,

441
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,110
<21-17,ESPOSITO>只写了"潘朵拉"
<21-17,ESPOSITO>but all it says is "Pandora."

442
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,910
<21-18,BECKETT>我等下打给你
<21-18,BECKETT>You know what? Let me get back to you.

443
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,070
<21-19,BECKETT>"潘朵拉"是什么
<21-19,BECKETT>What's Pandora?

444
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,270
<21-20,DANBERG>据我们所知
<21-20,DANBERG>According to the chatter,

445
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,040
<21-20,DANBERG>"潘朵拉"是盖奇任务的代号
<21-20,DANBERG>Pandora is the code name for Gage's mission,

446
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,990
<21-20,DANBERG>就是说这位麦格拉女士也牵涉其中
<21-20,DANBERG>which means that the McGrath woman is mixed up in it.

447
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,090
<21-21,SOPHIA>我们掌握的情况已全数告知
<21-21,SOPHIA>Now the two of you know as much as we do.

448
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,230
<21-21,SOPHIA>在这个案件上  你的表现很出色
<21-21,SOPHIA>Look, you have done impressive work on this case.

449
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,500
<21-21,SOPHIA>我要你负责搜捕托马斯·盖奇的行动
<21-21,SOPHIA>I want you to take the lead in finding Thomas Gage.

450
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,250
<21-22,DANBERG>索菲亚
<21-22,DANBERG>Sophia--

451
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,580
<21-23,SOPHIA>马丁  我们已经无计可施了
<21-23,SOPHIA>Martin, we are up against the wall.

452
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,420
<21-23,SOPHIA>中情局被禁止进行国内调查
<21-23,SOPHIA>The CIA is barred from domestic investigation.

453
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,990
<21-24,BECKETT>这种情况不是该联调局出手吗
<21-24,BECKETT>Well, isn't that what the FBI is for?

454
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,330
<21-24,BECKETT>托马斯·盖奇是幕前棋子
<21-24,BECKETT>Thomas Gage is a hired gun.

455
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,350
<21-25,SOPHIA>我们不知道他受雇于谁  牵涉有多深
<21-25,SOPHIA>We don't know who he works for or how deep this goes.

456
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,950
<21-25,SOPHIA>我希望你继续调查此案
<21-25,SOPHIA>All I am asking is that you continue your investigation,

457
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,760
<21-25,SOPHIA>我们得到他的情报会跟你们共享
<21-25,SOPHIA>and we will share all information we get on him.

458
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,300
<21-26,BECKETT>有什么条件
<21-26,BECKETT>And what's the catch?

459
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,440
<21-27,SOPHIA>礼尚往来
<21-27,SOPHIA>That you do the same,

460
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,830
<21-27,SOPHIA>而且你只向我汇报
<21-27,SOPHIA>and that you report only to me.

461
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,170
<21-27,SOPHIA>此事只能你知我知
<21-27,SOPHIA>This has to stay between us.

462
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,200
<21-27,SOPHIA>技术人员已经在你们手机里安装了程序
<21-27,SOPHIA>Our techs have uploaded icons on both your phones,

463
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,170
<21-27,SOPHIA>可以直接连线我的电话
<21-27,SOPHIA>which will connect you to my direct line.

464
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,920
<21-27,SOPHIA>你们也看到盖奇的手段了
<21-27,SOPHIA>You've seen what Gage is capable of.

465
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,590
<21-27,SOPHIA>他是我们最危险的特工之一
<21-27,SOPHIA>He's one of our most dangerous operatives,

466
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,000
<21-27,SOPHIA>我毫不怀疑  无论他在计划什么
<21-27,SOPHIA>and I have no doubt that, whatever he is planning,

467
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,690
<21-27,SOPHIA>他完全有能力使之成为事实
<21-27,SOPHIA>he is completely capable of carrying out.

468
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,800
<21-28,SOPHIA>我也不想让你身处险境
<21-28,SOPHIA>I wouldn't put you in this position,

469
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,000
<21-28,SOPHIA>但必须有人来阻止他
<21-28,SOPHIA>but this man has to be stopped.

470
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,810
<21-28,SOPHIA>我可以寄希望于你们的帮助吗
<21-28,SOPHIA>Can I count on you for your help?

471
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,300
<21-28,SOPHIA>可以
<21-28,SOPHIA>Yes.

472
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,910
<22-1,CASTLE>你意识到这代表着什么吗
<22-1,CASTLE>Do you realize what this means?

473
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,340
<22-1,CASTLE>我们成了特工
<22-1,CASTLE>We're spies.

474
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,040
<22-1,CASTLE>这就好像是《谍影重重》
<22-1,CASTLE>This is like being in a Jason Bourne movie,

475
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,540
<22-1,CASTLE>只是变节特工是反派  中情局成了好人
<22-1,CASTLE>only he's the bad guy, and the CIA are the good guys.

476
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,770
<22-2,BECKETT>-言之尚早  -对了
<22-2,BECKETT>- That remains to be seen. - Ooh, wait.

477
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,220
<22-3,CASTLE>我得看看他们装的直通电话符号
<22-3,CASTLE>I've gotta see those direct-dial icons they put on our phones.

478
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,340
<22-4,CASTLE>为什么我的是个紧急按钮
<22-4,CASTLE>Hey. Why is mine a panic button?

479
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,580
<22-5,BECKETT>看来她真的非常了解你
<22-5,BECKETT>I guess she really does know you well.

480
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,240
<22-6,CASTLE>好吧
<22-6,CASTLE>Okay.

481
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,510
<22-7,BECKETT>-你生气了  -我没生气
<22-7,BECKETT>- You're upset. - I'm not upset.

482
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,300
<22-8,CASTLE>那你是怎么了
<22-8,CASTLE>Then what are you?

483
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,670
<22-9,BECKETT>我只是对新的指挥架构
<22-9,BECKETT>I am just a little bit uncomfortable

484
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,780
<22-9,BECKETT>有点小情绪
<22-9,BECKETT>with the new command structure.

485
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,110
<22-9,BECKETT>我不喜欢对警局手足隐瞒秘密
<22-9,BECKETT>I don't like keeping secrets from my own people.

486
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,750
<22-10,CASTLE>你确定和索菲亚无关吗
<22-10,CASTLE>You're sure this isn't about Sophia?

487
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,990
<22-11,BECKETT>是的  关她什么事
<22-11,BECKETT>No, why would it be?

488
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,530
<22-12,CASTLE>我不知道
<22-12,CASTLE>Oh, I don't know.

489
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,240
<22-12,CASTLE>可能是因为我拿她做了人物原型
<22-12,CASTLE>Maybe because I based a character on her.

490
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,560
<22-13,BECKETT>少自作多情了  卡塞尔
<22-13,BECKETT>Oh, don't flatter yourself, Castle.

491
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,830
<22-13,BECKETT>那又不是多大的荣誉
<22-13,BECKETT>It's not that big an honor.

492
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,220
<22-14,CASTLE>好极了  因为索菲亚和我们同一战线
<22-14,CASTLE>Good, because Sophia is on our side.

493
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,240
<22-14,CASTLE>我们在同一阵营里
<22-14,CASTLE>We're on the same team.

494
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,490
<22-15,BECKETT>而你对此毫不担忧
<22-15,BECKETT>And that doesn't concern you?

495
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,360
<22-15,BECKETT>不觉得这会破坏团队凝聚力吗
<22-15,BECKETT>You don't think that that will undermine our unit cohesion?

496
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,270
<22-16,CASTLE>为了国家安全着想
<22-16,CASTLE>Hey, I am willing to let that slide

497
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,920
<22-16,CASTLE>我就不计较那些了
<22-16,CASTLE>in the interest of national security.

498
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,560
<22-17,BECKETT>我也一样
<22-17,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I guess I am, too.

499
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,590
<22-18,BECKETT>只是当我发现你还和
<22-18,BECKETT>It's just, I might have been a little bit taken aback

500
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,550
<22-18,BECKETT>其他人一起做研究...
<22-18,BECKETT>to find out that you had...

501
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,720
<22-18,BECKETT>有点吃惊罢了
<22-18,BECKETT>researched with someone else.

502
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,100
<22-19,CASTLE>我和她之间的关系跟咱俩之间是不一样的
<22-19,CASTLE>Look, it was never the way it is with you and me.

503
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,210
<22-19,CASTLE>我只是跟着她混了一段时间
<22-19,CASTLE>I just hung out with her for a while

504
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,910
<22-19,CASTLE>为了使克莱拉·斯瑞克更真实些
<22-19,CASTLE>to lend some authenticity to Clara Strike.

505
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,220
<22-19,CASTLE>很久之前的事了  持续时间很短
<22-19,CASTLE>It was a brief moment a long time ago.

506
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,260
<22-19,CASTLE>再说了  妮基·希特
<22-19,CASTLE>And besides, Nikki Heat

507
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,380
<22-19,CASTLE>可是个比其更复杂
<22-19,CASTLE>is a far more complex and...

508
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,300
<22-19,CASTLE>更微妙的人物
<22-19,CASTLE>nuanced character.

509
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,450
<22-19,CASTLE>真的
<22-19,CASTLE>She is.

510
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,820
<22-19,CASTLE>而我的写作经验也更丰富了
<22-19,CASTLE>And I'm a far more experienced writer,

511
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,750
<22-19,CASTLE>风格更加成熟
<22-19,CASTLE>more mature.

512
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,640
<22-20,CASTLE>忽悠过头了
<22-20,CASTLE>One out of two is...

513
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,000
<22-21,BECKETT>你跟她混了多久
<22-21,BECKETT>So how long did the two of you hang out?

514
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,990
<23-1,BECKETT>一年
<23-1,BECKETT>A year?

515
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,310
<23-1,BECKETT>那叫持续时间很短吗
<23-1,BECKETT>That's your idea of a brief moment?

516
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,650
<23-2,CASTLE>我那时初出茅庐  有很多东西需要她教
<23-2,CASTLE>I was young, and she had a lot to teach me.

517
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,980
<23-3,BECKETT>可不是嘛
<23-3,BECKETT>Ha! Yeah, I'll bet.

518
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,860
<23-4,CASTLE>我是说间谍的神秘世界
<23-4,CASTLE>A-about the shadowy world of espionage.

519
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,840
<23-5,BECKETT>我这么问吧  借研究之名
<23-5,BECKETT>Let me ask you this-- how many other women

520
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,890
<23-5,BECKETT>你还"半跟踪"过多少个女人
<23-5,BECKETT>have you semi-stalked in the name of research?

521
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,570
<23-6,CASTLE>这是个陷阱问题吗
<23-6,CASTLE>Is this a trick question?

522
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,460
<23-7,BECKETT>算了  我根本就不想知道
<23-7,BECKETT>You know what? I don't even want to know.

523
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,000
<23-7,BECKETT>贝克特探长
<23-7,BECKETT>Detective Beckett,

524
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,610
<23-8,GATES>卡塞尔先生  你们能回来真好
<23-8,GATES>Mr. Castle, good of you to drop by.

525
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,860
<23-8,GATES>跟我说说你们的特别任务
<23-8,GATES>So tell me about this special assignment of yours.

526
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,760
<23-9,BECKETT>很抱歉不行  长官
<23-9,BECKETT>I'm afraid I can't, sir.

527
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,710
<23-10,GATES>你说什么
<23-10,GATES>Excuse me?

528
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,130
<23-11,CASTLE>没错  此事属于"非需勿知"
<23-11,CASTLE>Yes, it's on a need-to-know basis.

529
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,590
<23-12,GATES>我需要知道
<23-12,GATES>And I need to know.

530
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,390
<23-13,BECKETT>长官  我想警部在这件事上
<23-13,BECKETT>Sir, I think that the Chief of Detectives

531
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,520
<23-13,BECKETT>会支持我的做法
<23-13,BECKETT>would back me up on this one.

532
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,190
<23-14,GATES>我们走着瞧
<23-14,GATES>We'll see about that.

533
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,730
<23-15,CASTLE>你看见她有多抓狂了吗
<23-15,CASTLE>Did you see how mad she was?

534
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,380
<23-15,CASTLE>老天  真是太棒了
<23-15,CASTLE>God, that was so good.

535
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,560
<23-16,RYAN>好了...
<23-16,RYAN>So...

536
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,580
<23-16,RYAN>说真的  出什么事了
<23-16,RYAN>Seriously, what's going on?

537
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,830
<23-17,BECKETT>伙计们  抱歉  我们真的不能透露
<23-17,BECKETT>Guys, I'm sorry. We really can't talk about it.

538
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,730
<23-18,ESPOSITO>得了吧  我们谁跟谁啊
<23-18,ESPOSITO>Come on. This is us.

539
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,210
<23-19,CASTLE>不行  抱歉了
<23-19,CASTLE>No. Hey, sorry, boys.

540
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,170
<23-19,CASTLE>这是机密  最高机密
<23-19,CASTLE>Classified. Top secret.

541
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,380
<23-19,CASTLE>只能我们知道
<23-19,CASTLE>Our eyes only.

542
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,770
<23-19,CASTLE>一级戒备
<23-19,CASTLE>Defcon 1.

543
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,350
<23-19,CASTLE>要是告诉你了
<23-19,CASTLE>And if I did tell you,

544
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,610
<23-19,CASTLE>我就得杀了你
<23-19,CASTLE>well, then I'd have to kill you.

545
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,010
<23-20,ESPOSITO>-那就试试看  -事实上  我做不...
<23-20,ESPOSITO>- Yeah? Good luck with that. - Yeah, realistically, that's not--

546
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,270
<23-21,CASTLE>-我声明遮遮掩掩太烂了  -没错
<23-21,CASTLE>- I'm gonna go on record and say that this sucks. - It sucks.

547
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,620
<23-23,RYAN>晓得了  还是继续调查特雷西·麦格拉
<23-23,RYAN>And noted. Now let's move on to Tracy McGrath.

548
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,020
<23-24,BECKETT>她在下班之后去了哪里
<23-24,BECKETT>Where'd she go after she left work?

549
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,010
<23-25,RYAN>根据她的易行通
<23-25,RYAN>Well, according to her E-Z Pass,

550
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,340
<23-25,RYAN>她驱车上了新泽西高速公路
<23-25,RYAN>she drove down the Jersey turnpike

551
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,500
<23-25,RYAN>在纽瓦克机场附近下了公路
<23-25,RYAN>and exited somewhere near Newark Airport.

552
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,850
<23-25,RYAN>我们还在查她去了哪里
<23-25,RYAN>We're still trying to figure out where she went.

553
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,090
<23-26,CASTLE>可能答案仍在犯罪现场
<23-26,CASTLE>Maybe the answer's still at the crime scene.

554
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,190
<24-1,BECKETT>没有强行闯入和争斗痕迹
<24-1,BECKETT>There's no signs of forced entry or struggle.

555
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,950
<24-1,BECKETT>看来她认识凶手  让他进入了公寓
<24-1,BECKETT>It's like she knew her killer, she let him in.

556
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,380
<24-1,BECKETT>她走在凶手前面
<24-1,BECKETT>She walked in front of him,

557
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,010
<24-1,BECKETT>他朝她后脑勺开了一枪
<24-1,BECKETT>and he shot her in the back of the head.

558
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,100
<24-2,CASTLE>也就是说她认识盖奇
<24-2,CASTLE>Which means she knew Gage.

559
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,170
<24-2,CASTLE>气候学家怎么会和
<24-2,CASTLE>So how is a climate scientist

560
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,170
<24-2,CASTLE>一个残忍的前中情局探员扯上关系
<24-2,CASTLE>mixed up with a ruthless ex-CIA agent?

561
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,380
<24-3,BECKETT>她又怎么会和潘朵拉有联系
<24-3,BECKETT>And how is she connected to Pandora?

562
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,390
<24-4,BECKETT>这里一定有能将两者联系起来的线索
<24-4,BECKETT>There's gotta be something here that ties them together.

563
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,930
<24-5,CASTLE>她对车的品味还不错嘛
<24-5,CASTLE>Well, she has excellent taste in cars.

564
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,210
<24-5,CASTLE>这里有本1967年产
<24-5,CASTLE>Here's an auto repair manual

565
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,300
<24-5,CASTLE>庞蒂克GTO的维修手册
<24-5,CASTLE>for a 1967 Pontiac GTO.

566
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,590
<24-7,CASTLE>有意思
<24-7,CASTLE>That's funny.

567
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,710
<24-7,CASTLE>钥匙放在昨天收到的一堆信上
<24-7,CASTLE>The keys are sitting on a pile of yesterday's mail.

568
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,390
<24-7,CASTLE>死之前  她还开过这车
<24-7,CASTLE>She drove it before she died.

569
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,390
<24-8,BECKETT>但街上没有GTO
<24-8,BECKETT>Except there's no GTO in the street.

570
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,220
<24-9,CASTLE>车库里也没有  车呢
<24-9,CASTLE>Or in the garage, so where's the car?

571
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,320
<25-1,RYAN>我在信用卡上发现了一条常规收费记录
<25-1,RYAN>I see a recurring charge on her credit card.

572
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,990
<25-1,RYAN>看来她每月都会付给
<25-1,RYAN>It looks like she's paying 100 bucks a month

573
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,410
<25-1,RYAN>弗兰奇停车场一百美元
<25-1,RYAN>for Frenchie's Parking.

574
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,570
<25-2,CASTLE>才一百  在曼哈顿可不止这个数
<25-2,CASTLE>100 bucks? That's not gonna get you a space in Manhattan.

575
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,560
<25-3,RYAN>没错  账单信息显示弗兰奇停车场在
<25-3,RYAN>Bingo. Billing info says that Frenchie's is in

576
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,820
<25-3,RYAN>新泽西州的伊丽莎白港口
<25-3,RYAN>Elizabeth Port, New Jersey.

577
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,450
<25-4,BECKETT>就在纽瓦克机场附近
<25-4,BECKETT>That's right near Newark Airport.

578
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,680
<25-5,CASTLE>特雷西的神秘之旅开的是这辆GTO
<25-5,CASTLE>So the mystery ride Tracy took has to do with the GTO.

579
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,770
<25-5,CASTLE>就是它了
<25-5,CASTLE>There it is.

580
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,080
<26-1,CASTLE>这可是经典的汽车城[底特律]车
<26-1,CASTLE>Now that is some classic Motor City iron.

581
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,240
<26-2,BECKETT>十米长车身  罗契斯特的四排管
<26-2,BECKETT>400 cubic inches with a Rochester 4-barrel

582
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,220
<26-2,BECKETT>有360马力
<26-2,BECKETT>and 360 horsepower.

583
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,670
<26-3,CASTLE>-你了解大马力车  -是的
<26-3,CASTLE>- You know muscle cars? - Oh, yeah.

584
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,170
<26-4,BECKETT>改天我们该去赛道上比比  卡塞尔
<26-4,BECKETT>We should go to the track sometime, Castle.

585
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,740
<26-4,BECKETT>看看谁会被套圈[lap有舔的意思]
<26-4,BECKETT>See who laps who.

586
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,630
<26-5,BECKETT>你觉得特雷西为什么会翘班来到这里
<26-5,BECKETT>So why do you think Tracy took off work to come down here?

587
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,030
<26-6,CASTLE>也许是要驱车到某个秘密的
<26-6,CASTLE>Maybe to drive it to a clandestine

588
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,580
<26-6,CASTLE>潘朵拉相关的会合地点
<26-6,CASTLE>Pandora-related, uh, rendezvous?

589
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,460
<26-7,BECKETT>不是  看看车上的积灰
<26-7,BECKETT>No. Look at the dust on this.

590
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,530
<26-7,BECKETT>这车停在这里有一阵了
<26-7,BECKETT>This hasn't gone anywhere in a while.

591
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,930
<26-8,BECKETT>你看  卡塞尔
<26-8,BECKETT>Castle, look.

592
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,000
<26-8,BECKETT>也许她在汽车后备箱里藏了东西
<26-8,BECKETT>Maybe she came to stash something in the trunk.

593
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,320
<26-9,CASTLE>有手印  说明有人动过后备箱
<26-9,CASTLE>Handprints, indicating someone's been in there.

594
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,950
<26-10,BECKETT>没错
<26-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

595
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,980
<26-11,CASTLE>这可不是原车设备
<26-11,CASTLE>That is not original equipment.

596
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,720
<26-12,BECKETT>是的  八成这就是她来此地的原因
<26-12,BECKETT>No, but it's probably why she came here.

597
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,350
<26-13,CASTLE>等等  等一下
<26-13,CASTLE>Wait-- wait a minute. Wait a minute.

598
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
<26-13,CASTLE>还不知道这里面有什么
<26-13,CASTLE>We don't know what's in there.

599
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,540
<26-14,BECKETT>对  这是唯一能知道的方法
<26-14,BECKETT>Yeah, well, there's only one way to find out.

600
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,710
<26-15,CASTLE>但里面可能是潘朵拉
<26-15,CASTLE>Yeah, but it might be Pandora,

601
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,050
<26-16,CASTLE>就像潘朵拉魔盒  打开它之后
<26-16,CASTLE>as in "Pandora's box," as in opening that

602
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,050
<26-16,CASTLE>就会释放出无法阻止的罪恶
<26-16,CASTLE>could unleash an unstoppable tide of evil.

603
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,380
<26-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那个是神话故事
<26-17,BECKETT>Castle, that's a myth.

604
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,190
<26-18,CASTLE>我那是比喻
<26-18,CASTLE>I'm speaking metaphorically.

605
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,160
<26-18,CASTLE>盖奇在酝酿一起灾难性事件  对吧
<26-18,CASTLE>Gage is planning a catastrophic event, right?

606
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,810
<26-18,CASTLE>如果箱子里有末日装置
<26-18,CASTLE>So what if there's a doomsday device

607
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,050
<26-18,CASTLE>而你开箱的时候就会启动怎么办
<26-18,CASTLE>in that case set to go off when you open it?

608
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,820
<26-19,BECKETT>而零点位置就定在这个新泽西州的室内停车场吗
<26-19,BECKETT>And Ground Zero is a parking garage in New Jersey?

609
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,990
<26-19,BECKETT>我有点怀疑
<26-19,BECKETT>I doubt it.

610
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,310
<26-20,CASTLE>我只...
<26-20,CASTLE>I ju--

611
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,000
<26-21,CASTLE>这是军用手机和扰频器
<26-21,CASTLE>That is a military-grade cell phone and a scrambler.

612
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,280
<26-21,CASTLE>是间谍的装备
<26-21,CASTLE>That's spy equipment.

613
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,050
<26-22,BECKETT>特雷西来到这里只为打电话
<26-22,BECKETT>Tracy came here to make a phone call,

614
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,400
<26-22,BECKETT>我打赌她拨的最后一通电话号码
<26-22,BECKETT>and I bet you that the last number she dialed

615
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,050
<26-22,BECKETT>仍在手机上
<26-22,BECKETT>is still on the phone.

616
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,120
<26-23,GAGE>关上箱子  转身
<26-23,GAGE>Close the case and turn around.

617
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,650
<26-23,GAGE>举起手来
<26-23,GAGE>Hands in the air.

618
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,060
<26-24,BECKETT>盖奇
<26-24,BECKETT>Gage.

619
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,970
<26-25,GAGE>把枪和手机放在地上
<26-25,GAGE>Your weapon and phones on the ground.

620
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,580
<26-26,BECKETT>不是吧  该你举起手吧
<26-26,BECKETT>Really? You put your hands in the air.

621
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,740
<26-28,GAGE>把手机放在地上
<26-28,GAGE>Your phones on the ground.

622
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,940
<26-29,CASTLE>我可刚升级
<26-29,CASTLE>I just upgraded.

623
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,740
<26-29,CASTLE>这是新电话
<26-29,CASTLE>This is a brand-new phone.

624
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,150
<26-29,CASTLE>好了...
<26-29,CASTLE>Now...

625
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,640
<26-30,GAGE>恐怕你们不会喜欢接下来的事
<26-30,GAGE>I'm afraid you're not gonna like what comes next.

626
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,120
<27-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<27-1,BECKETT>Castle.

627
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,580
<27-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在干什么
<27-2,BECKETT>Castle, what are you doing?

628
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,870
<27-3,CASTLE>做肉盾  为你挡子弹啊
<27-3,CASTLE>Bracing myself to shield you from a hail of bullets.

629
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,490
<27-4,BECKETT>你可真英勇啊
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that's very gallant of you,

630
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,530
<27-4,BECKETT>不过不用撑了
<27-4,BECKETT>but you can stop bracing.

631
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,660
<27-4,BECKETT>我想他走了
<27-4,BECKETT>I think he left.

632
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,590
<27-5,CASTLE>往事在我眼前一一掠过
<27-5,CASTLE>Man, my life was passing before my eyes.

633
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,240
<27-5,CASTLE>有点忘记时间了
<27-5,CASTLE>I think I lost track of time.

634
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,420
<27-6,BECKETT>你熟悉后备箱插销吗
<27-6,BECKETT>What do you know about trunk latches?

635
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,920
<27-7,CASTLE>坏消息是
<27-7,CASTLE>Well, the bad news is,

636
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,750
<27-7,CASTLE>后备箱没有设计成从里面打开
<27-7,CASTLE>this one was not designed to open from the inside.

637
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,970
<27-8,BECKETT>那好消息是什么
<27-8,BECKETT>And the good news?

638
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,090
<27-9,CASTLE>至少这次  我们没被铐在一起
<27-9,CASTLE>At least this time, we're not handcuffed together.

639
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,880
<27-11,CASTLE>这里还挺宽敞的
<27-11,CASTLE>Mm. You know, it's surprisingly roomy in here.

640
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,770
<27-12,BECKETT>也没那么宽敞
<27-12,BECKETT>Well, it's not that roomy.

641
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,840
<27-12,BECKETT>这里的空气迟早会被耗尽
<27-12,BECKETT>Sooner or later, we're gonna run out of air.

642
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,250
<27-12,BECKETT>我们得从这里出去
<27-12,BECKETT>We gotta get out of here.

643
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,960
<27-13,CASTLE>也许有人会找到我们
<27-13,CASTLE>Well, maybe somebody will find us.

644
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,060
<27-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们被关在长期停车场
<27-14,BECKETT>Castle, we are locked in the trunk of a car

645
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,400
<27-14,BECKETT>一辆车的后备箱里
<27-14,BECKETT>in long-term parking.

646
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,470
<27-14,BECKETT>在有人意识到我们失踪之前还有很长时间
<27-14,BECKETT>It's gonna be hours before anyone realizes that we're missing.

647
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,640
<27-14,BECKETT>你觉得谁会找到我们
<27-14,BECKETT>Who do you think is gonna find us?

648
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,080
<27-15,CASTLE>我只是觉得  在这种情况下
<27-15,CASTLE>I just feel, in situations like this,

649
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,680
<27-15,CASTLE>有信念是很重要的
<27-15,CASTLE>it's important to have faith.

650
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,240
<27-16,BECKETT>你是不是按了紧急按钮
<27-16,BECKETT>You pressed the panic button, didn't you?

651
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,170
<27-17,CASTLE>要说紧急情况
<27-17,CASTLE>Well, if there was ever a time to panic,

652
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,720
<27-17,CASTLE>-我想就是现在了  -我
<27-17,CASTLE>- I think this was it. - I am--

653
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,790
<27-18,CASTLE>-你应该感谢我  -才不呢
<27-18,CASTLE>- You should be thanking me. - No.

654
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,920
<27-19,BECKETT>我才不要等着你女友来救我呢
<27-19,BECKETT>I am not gonna be rescued by your girlfriend.

655
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,990
<27-19,BECKETT>过去点  卡塞尔
<27-19,BECKETT>Move, Castle.

656
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,970
<27-21,BECKETT>-你要干  -我要往里伸点
<27-21,BECKETT>- What are you-- - I need to get under there.

657
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,710
<27-22,CASTLE>你在   你在干嘛
<27-22,CASTLE>What are you-- what are you doing?

658
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,560
<27-23,BECKETT>我拿到了
<27-23,BECKETT>I got it.

659
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,650
<27-24,CASTLE>什么东西
<27-24,CASTLE>What?

660
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,380
<27-25,BECKETT>这个  来
<27-25,BECKETT>This. Here.

661
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:57,930
<27-25,BECKETT>插进去了吗
<27-25,BECKETT>Is it in?

662
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,790
<27-26,CASTLE>再往左点
<27-26,CASTLE>To the left.

663
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,430
<27-28,CASTLE>好了  插吧
<27-28,CASTLE>Okay. Push.

664
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,010
<27-29,BECKETT>往后躺一点
<27-29,BECKETT>Scoot down.

665
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,600
<27-31,CASTLE>-成功了  -干得好
<27-31,CASTLE>- Yes. - Nice.

666
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,220
<27-32,AGENT JONES>为你们准备的
<27-32,AGENT JONES>For you.

667
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,300
<28-1,SOPHIA>我想这是你的配枪
<28-1,SOPHIA>I believe this is yours.

668
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,940
<28-1,SOPHIA>琼斯特工在停车场找到的
<28-1,SOPHIA>Agent Jones found it in the parking structure.

669
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,930
<28-2,SOPHIA>找到车真是干得太棒了
<28-2,SOPHIA>Finding the car was great work.

670
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,340
<28-2,SOPHIA>我想它就是我们所需要的突破点
<28-2,SOPHIA>I think it might just be the break we need.

671
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,010
<28-3,CASTLE>我可不敢独吞所有功劳
<28-3,CASTLE>Well, I can't take all the credit.

672
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,010
<28-4,BECKETT>是啊  发现车子的人可是莱恩警探
<28-4,BECKETT>Yeah, especially since it was Detective Ryan who found it.

673
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,770
<28-5,SOPHIA>不管怎样  电话显然是关键
<28-5,SOPHIA>Well, in any case, the phone is obviously key,

674
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,460
<28-5,SOPHIA>不然盖奇也不会拼命去找
<28-5,SOPHIA>or else Gage wouldn't have gone after it.

675
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,210
<28-6,CASTLE>特雷西·麦格拉在她死的那天用过这个电话
<28-6,CASTLE>Well, Tracy McGrath used it on the day she died.

676
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,390
<28-6,CASTLE>也许她打给某个同潘朵拉有关的人
<28-6,CASTLE>Maybe she called someone connected to Pandora...

677
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,480
<28-7,SOPHIA>然后盖奇杀掉她  拿走电话
<28-7,SOPHIA>And then Gage eliminated her and took the phone

678
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,310
<28-7,SOPHIA>不留任何活口
<28-7,SOPHIA>to tie off all loose ends.

679
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,030
<28-8,BECKETT>但这仍然说明不了盖奇在哪儿
<28-8,BECKETT>Which still doesn't explain where Gage is now

680
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,840
<28-8,BECKETT>特雷西电话打给谁了
<28-8,BECKETT>or who Tracy called.

681
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,040
<28-9,SOPHIA>一旦我们追踪到那通电话  就会知道了
<28-9,SOPHIA>Well, we'll find that out once we track the call she made.

682
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,570
<28-10,CASTLE>但电话被盖奇拿走了
<28-10,CASTLE>But Gage took the phone.

683
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,560
<28-10,CASTLE>你既不知道她打出的号码
<28-10,CASTLE>How can you do that when you don't know what number she called

684
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,260
<28-10,CASTLE>也不知道她用什么号码   你要怎么追查
<28-10,CASTLE>or even the number she called it from?

685
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,300
<28-11,SOPHIA>用最酷的玩具咯
<28-11,SOPHIA>By using all the coolest toys.

686
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,890
<28-12,SOPHIA>查下取道收费高速  昨天下午三点时
<28-12,SOPHIA>Bring up Newton Foundation to Frenchie's parking,

687
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,790
<28-12,SOPHIA>从牛顿基金会到弗兰奇停车场需要多久
<28-12,SOPHIA>commute time by car at 3:00 p.m. yesterday via the turnpike.

688
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:18,980
<28-13,SOPHIA>41分钟
<28-13,SOPHIA>41 minutes.

689
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,500
<28-13,SOPHIA>在华盛顿大桥那里有起小交通事故
<28-13,SOPHIA>There was a fender bender on the G.W. Bridge.

690
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,050
<28-13,SOPHIA>加上她走到车那里所需的时间
<28-13,SOPHIA>Factoring the time it would have taken her to get to her car,

691
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,160
<28-13,SOPHIA>假设她3点45分抵达
<28-13,SOPHIA>let's say she got there at 3:45 p.m.

692
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,070
<28-13,SOPHIA>筛选出接下来15分钟打出的电话
<28-13,SOPHIA>Pull up all cell phone traffic for the next 15 minutes.

693
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,310
<28-14,SOPHIA>电话会经过最近的手机信号发射塔
<28-14,SOPHIA>The call would've pinged off the nearest cell tower.

694
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,630
<28-14,SOPHIA>人在纽瓦克机场的南边
<28-14,SOPHIA>This guy at the south end of the Newark Airport,

695
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,120
<28-15,SOPHIA>则筛选得到
<28-15,SOPHIA>which processed...

696
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,630
<28-16,SOPHIA>15分钟内共有5429通电话
<28-16,SOPHIA>5,429 calls in the 15-minute time frame.

697
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,030
<28-14,SOPHIA>只显示打往纽约和新泽西的
<28-14,SOPHIA>Filter it to calls just to New York and New Jersey.

698
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,860
<29-14,SOPHIA>还有4112通
<29-14,SOPHIA>That takes us to 4,112.

699
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,580
<28-15,SOPHIA>现在只要投币式公用电话和没登记的手机
<28-15,SOPHIA>Now just pay phones and unregistered cells.

700
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,010
<28-15,SOPHIA>降到712通
<28-15,SOPHIA>Down to 712.

701
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,990
<28-16,SOPHIA>通话时间一分钟以内的
<28-16,SOPHIA>Calls under a minute.

702
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,570
<28-16,SOPHIA>她肯定言简意赅
<28-16,SOPHIA>She would've kept it brief.

703
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,920
<28-16,SOPHIA>还有42通
<28-16,SOPHIA>We're at 42.

704
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,230
<28-17,SOPHIA>三角定位这42个手机信号
<28-17,SOPHIA>Okay, now triangulate those 42 signals,

705
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,550
<28-17,SOPHIA>看哪通电话的信号
<28-17,SOPHIA>and let's see which one originates

706
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,580
<28-17,SOPHIA>离停车场最近
<28-17,SOPHIA>closest to that parking structure.

707
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,500
<28-19,SOPHIA>找到了  昨天下午3点56分
<28-19,SOPHIA>Got it. Yesterday at 3:56 p.m.

708
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,090
<28-19,SOPHIA>此通电话经过发射塔
<28-19,SOPHIA>This call pinged off the tower

709
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,660
<28-19,SOPHIA>打给了布鲁克林的一个投币式公用电话
<28-19,SOPHIA>and was routed to a pay phone in Brooklyn.

710
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,020
<28-19,SOPHIA>普利茅斯街和金色大街的十字路口
<28-19,SOPHIA>Uh, intersection of Plymouth and Gold.

711
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,540
<28-19,SOPHIA>应该就是特雷西·麦格拉打的那个号码
<28-19,SOPHIA>It's gotta be the number Tracy Mcgrath called .

712
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,000
<28-19,SOPHIA>找到能看到那个电话的摄像头
<28-19,SOPHIA>Get me eyes on that pay phone.

713
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,920
<28-19,SOPHIA>调出昨天下午3点56分所有的当地监控录像
<28-19,SOPHIA>Any local surveillance from yesterday at 3:56 p.m.

714
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,090
<32-3,ESPOSITO>找到了
<32-3,ESPOSITO>Found one.

715
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,470
<28-18,CASTLE>正在剔除
<28-18,CASTLE>Isolating now.

716
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,170
<28-19,SOPHIA>有段录像  下午3点56分
<28-19,SOPHIA>There's a video. At 3:56 p.m.

717
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,800
<28-20,SOPHIA>拉近点
<28-20,SOPHIA>Zoom in.

718
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,750
<26-21,CASTLE>他手上拿着扰频器  就是我们要找的人
<26-21,CASTLE>He's got a scrambler. That's our guy.

719
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,200
<28-21,SOPHIA>他看起来眼熟
<28-21,SOPHIA>He looks familiar.

720
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,770
<28-21,SOPHIA>停
<28-21,SOPHIA>Freeze there.

721
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,150
<28-22,SOPHIA>天啊
<28-22,SOPHIA>Oh, my god.

722
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,790
<28-22,SOPHIA>这不可能
<28-22,SOPHIA>That's impossible.

723
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,880
<28-22,SOPHIA>他不是已经死了吗
<28-22,SOPHIA>He's supposed to be dead.

724
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,580
<28-23,CASTLE>他是谁
<28-23,CASTLE>Who is he?

725
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,460
<28-23,CASTLE>尼尔森·布莱克利博士
<28-23,CASTLE>Dr. Nelson Blakely.

726
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,170
<29-1,DANBERG>数学教授
<29-1,DANBERG>Mathematics professor.

727
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,870
<29-1,DANBERG>中情局传奇
<29-1,DANBERG>He was a legend at the agency.

728
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,540
<29-1,DANBERG>天才
<29-1,DANBERG>A genius.

729
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,840
<29-1,DANBERG>我们的顾问
<29-1,DANBERG>Consulted for us,

730
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,410
<29-1,DANBERG>但于2002年去世
<29-1,DANBERG>but died in 2002,

731
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,560
<29-1,DANBERG>至少直到刚才我们是这么认为的
<29-1,DANBERG>or at least that's what we thought until just now.

732
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,450
<29-2,CASTLE>他伪造了自己的死亡
<29-2,CASTLE>So he faked his own death.

733
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,050
<29-2,CASTLE>这事越来越有趣了
<29-2,CASTLE>This just keeps getting better.

734
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,200
<29-3,SOPHIA>不是这样的
<29-3,SOPHIA>No, it doesn't,

735
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,280
<29-3,SOPHIA>以他的能耐  不能说有趣
<29-3,SOPHIA>not with what this man is capable of.

736
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,730
<29-3,SOPHIA>布莱克利帮我们设计以数学为基础的预测模式
<29-3,SOPHIA>Blakely designed math-based predictive models for us,

737
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,260
<29-3,SOPHIA>用于创造地缘政治的变化
<29-3,SOPHIA>models to help create geopolitical change.

738
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,140
<29-4,BECKETT>此话怎讲
<29-4,BECKETT>What do you mean by that?

739
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,080
<29-5,DANBERG>局里带着问题找到他
<29-5,DANBERG>The agency would bring him a problem--

740
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,100
<29-5,DANBERG>我们怎样做才能阻止A国家得到炸弹
<29-5,DANBERG>How can we prevent country "A" from getting the bomb

741
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,840
<29-5,DANBERG>或者引致B国家政权更迭
<29-5,DANBERG>or cause regime change in country "B."

742
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,210
<29-5,DANBERG>布莱克利找到了解决办法
<29-5,DANBERG>Blakely found solutions

743
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,160
<29-5,DANBERG>运用他所谓的关键理论
<29-5,DANBERG>using what he called Linchpin theory.

744
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,810
<29-5,DANBERG>他的方法是找到能引起
<29-5,DANBERG>His approach was to find a small event

745
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,440
<29-5,DANBERG>大冲突的小事件
<29-5,DANBERG>that could trigger a large event.

746
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,420
<29-6,CASTLE>例如引起第一次世界大战的
<29-6,CASTLE>Like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand

747
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,520
<29-6,CASTLE>萨拉热窝事件
<29-6,CASTLE>causing World War I.

748
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,750
<29-6,CASTLE>完全正确
<29-6,CASTLE>Exactly.

749
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,330
<29-7,SOPHIA>他曾说过  你只需推倒一块多米诺骨牌
<29-7,SOPHIA>He once said that you only had to knock over one domino,

750
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,080
<29-7,SOPHIA>如果是至关重要的那块
<29-7,SOPHIA>but if it was the right domino,

751
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,640
<29-7,SOPHIA>其它的就会顺势倒下
<29-7,SOPHIA>the rest would fall.

752
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,210
<29-7,SOPHIA>如果布莱克利就是策划潘朵拉的人
<29-7,SOPHIA>If Blakely is the one who planned Pandora,

753
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,880
<29-7,SOPHIA>那将远超出最坏的设想
<29-7,SOPHIA>this is beyond a worst-case scenario.

754
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,030
<29-8,DANBERG>布莱克利只是个雇员  跟盖奇一样
<29-8,DANBERG>Blakely is just a hired gun, like Gage.

755
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,340
<29-9,SOPHIA>他可不是幕后黑手
<29-9,SOPHIA>He's not the one behind this.

756
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,230
<29-9,SOPHIA>特纳探员  我找到了
<29-9,SOPHIA>Agent Turner, I've got it.

757
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,560
<29-10,SOPHIA>录像的清晰度足以读出他的唇语
<29-10,SOPHIA>The video's clean enough to track his lip movement.

758
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,900
<29-10,SOPHIA>他说了什么
<29-10,SOPHIA>What's he saying?

759
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,290
<29-11,BLAKELY>周四下午五点来见我
<29-11,BLAKELY>Meet me Thursday at 5:00 p.m.

760
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,460
<29-11,BLAKELY>象 A5
<29-11,BLAKELY>Bishop A-5,

761
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,750
<29-11,BLAKELY>象  C4  卒  E3
<29-11,BLAKELY>bishop C-4, pawn E-3.

762
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,170
<29-12,CASTLE>国际象棋走法吗
<29-12,CASTLE>Chess moves?

763
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,040
<29-13,DANBERG>布莱克利曾是世界级的国际象棋大师
<29-13,DANBERG>Blakely was a world-class chess player.

764
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,830
<29-13,DANBERG>是某种密码
<29-13,DANBERG>It's some sort of code.

765
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,920
<29-13,DANBERG>与加密数据库内所有加密模式做对比
<29-13,DANBERG>Run that pattern against anything in the encryption database.

766
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,970
<29-14,SOPHIA>这个发现将我们带进了敏感地带
<29-14,SOPHIA>This takes us into a sensitive area.

767
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,570
<29-15,CASTLE>不能让外人知道  我懂的
<29-15,CASTLE>For your eyes only. I get it.

768
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,400
<29-16,SOPHIA>非常感谢你的帮助
<29-16,SOPHIA>Thank you so much for your help.

769
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,350
<29-17,SOPHIA>琼斯特工会带你们出去的
<29-17,SOPHIA>Agent Jones will show you out.

770
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,400
<29-18,BECKETT>等下  盖奇怎么办
<29-18,BECKETT>W-wait a minute. What about Gage?

771
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,880
<29-19,SOPHIA>我们得集中人力物力找到布莱克利
<29-19,SOPHIA>We need to invest all of our resources into finding Blakely.

772
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,990
<29-19,SOPHIA>他是此案的薄弱环节
<29-19,SOPHIA>He's the weak link here.

773
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,540
<29-20,BECKETT>但如果你们发现与盖奇有关的线索
<29-20,BECKETT>Right, but if you find something on Gage,

774
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,650
<29-20,BECKETT>麻烦通知我们
<29-20,BECKETT>you'll let us know.

775
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,010
<29-21,SOPHIA>当然  我们站在同一战线
<29-21,SOPHIA>Absolutely. We're in this together.

776
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,970
<30-1,CASTLE>知道我怎么想的吗
<30-1,CASTLE>You know what I think?

777
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,220
<30-1,CASTLE>我觉得我们应该破解国际象棋密码
<30-1,CASTLE>I think we should crack that chess code.

778
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,110
<30-2,BECKETT>中情局能破解的  卡塞尔
<30-2,BECKETT>The CIA can handle it, Castle.

779
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,260
<30-3,CASTLE>凭他们的履历
<30-3,CASTLE>With their track record?

780
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,730
<30-3,CASTLE>我可不这么乐观
<30-3,CASTLE>I'm not so sure.

781
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,240
<30-3,CASTLE>我就那么一说
<30-3,CASTLE>I'm just sayin'.

782
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,700
<30-3,CASTLE>一旦我们成功破解密码
<30-3,CASTLE>Look, we decipher that code,

783
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,480
<30-3,CASTLE>就能避免一场灾难性事件的发生
<30-3,CASTLE>we can save this country from a nameless cataclysmic event.

784
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,560
<30-4,BECKETT>要是你想追查布莱克利就去吧
<30-4,BECKETT>Look, if you want to go after Blakely, go ahead.

785
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,320
<30-4,BECKETT>我是凶案探长
<30-4,BECKETT>I'm a Homicide Detective.

786
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,700
<30-4,BECKETT>我必须找到托马斯·盖奇
<30-4,BECKETT>I have to find Thomas Gage,

787
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,230
<30-4,BECKETT>而听从索菲亚·特纳指挥是找不到他的
<30-4,BECKETT>and I can't do that by answering to Sophia Turner.

788
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,250
<30-5,CASTLE>什么意思
<30-5,CASTLE>What do you mean?

789
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,530
<30-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他杀了两个人
<30-6,BECKETT>He killed two people, Castle.

790
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,740
<30-6,BECKETT>你觉得她对此在意吗
<30-6,BECKETT>Do you think she even cares about that?

791
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,600
<30-6,BECKETT>不  她还有别的事要做呢
<30-6,BECKETT>No. She's got a whole different agenda.

792
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,260
<30-7,CASTLE>比如拯救世界  我们站在同一阵线
<30-7,CASTLE>Yeah, like saving the world. We're all on the same team here.

793
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,050
<30-8,BECKETT>不  你站在她那边
<30-8,BECKETT>No, you're on her team,

794
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,680
<30-8,BECKETT>从你看她的眼神
<30-8,BECKETT>cause the way you look at her,

795
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,610
<30-8,BECKETT>你铁定没有站在我这边
<30-8,BECKETT>you're sure as hell not on mine.

796
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,480
<30-9,BECKETT>真有必要吗
<30-9,BECKETT>Seriously?

797
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,260
<30-10,AGENT JONES>这可是保密机构
<30-10,AGENT JONES>This is a secure facility.

798
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,980
<30-10,AGENT JONES>我们不想泄密
<30-10,AGENT JONES>We need to keep it that way.

799
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,670
<31-1,MARTHA>我刚和阿丽克西斯谈完
<31-1,MARTHA>I just had a talk with Alexis.

800
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,630
<31-1,MARTHA>我很高兴你没反对这个实习
<31-1,MARTHA>I am so pleased you are on board with this internship.

801
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,410
<31-2,CASTLE>我只是被逼无奈
<31-2,CASTLE>Because I was forced to be on board.

802
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,990
<31-2,CASTLE>妈  你怎么会让这事发生呢
<31-2,CASTLE>How could you let that happen, mother?

803
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,110
<31-3,MARTHA>亲爱的 别傻了
<31-3,MARTHA>Oh, darling, don't be silly.

804
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,240
<31-3,MARTHA>你心情不好
<31-3,MARTHA>And you're just in a foul mood

805
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,560
<31-3,MARTHA>不过是因为跟贝克特吵架了
<31-3,MARTHA>because you had a spat with Beckett.

806
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,970
<34-4,BECKETT>我才没
<34-4,BECKETT>I am not in a...

807
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,120
<31-4,CASTLE>你怎么看出来的
<31-4,CASTLE>How did you find out about that?

808
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,250
<31-5,CASTLE>不  先别说  等我猜猜
<31-5,CASTLE>No, wait. Let me guess.

809
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,330
<31-5,CASTLE>贝克特告诉蕾妮
<31-5,CASTLE>Beckett to Lanie

810
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,030
<31-5,CASTLE>她再告诉阿丽克西斯  再传到你这儿
<31-5,CASTLE>to Alexis to you.

811
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,830
<31-5,CASTLE>看吧  这就是令我害怕的
<31-5,CASTLE>See? This, this is what I was afraid of.

812
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,970
<31-5,CASTLE>不过我得说清楚  我们可没吵架
<31-5,CASTLE>For your information, we did not have a spat.

813
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,180
<31-5,CASTLE>我今天只是选择待在家
<31-5,CASTLE>I simply chose to work at home today.

814
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:25,160
<31-6,MARTHA>忙于一件牵涉到消失的尸体和特别任务的案件
<31-6,MARTHA>On a case involving vanishing bodies and special assignments.

815
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,430
<31-7,CASTLE>不是吧  这事她也告诉你了
<31-7,CASTLE>Really? She told you that, too?

816
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,380
<31-7,CASTLE>-我现在还有隐私可言吗  -基本没有
<31-7,CASTLE>- Is nothing sacred?  - Not much.

817
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,230
<31-9,CASTLE>不过不管怎样  我不能跟你讨论这个案子
<31-9,CASTLE>Yes, well, in any event, I'm not allowed to discuss it.

818
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,080
<31-10,MARTHA>拜托  你以前也没因此闭嘴啊
<31-10,MARTHA>Oh, please. When has that stopped you before?

819
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,250
<31-11,CASTLE>显然我现在该定定规矩了
<31-11,CASTLE>Well, clearly it's time i start setting some boundaries around here.

820
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,760
<31-12,MARTHA>好吧
<31-12,MARTHA>All right.

821
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,220
<31-13,CASTLE>我只可以告诉你
<31-13,CASTLE>I can tell you this much.

822
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,210
<31-13,CASTLE>我现在在研究一个密码
<31-13,CASTLE>I'm working on a code...

823
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,290
<31-13,CASTLE>这个密码就由这三个棋子构成
<31-13,CASTLE>involving these three chess pieces.

824
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,630
<31-13,CASTLE>要是能破译出来  就能防止一场大灾难
<31-13,CASTLE>The answer to which could avert a catastrophe.

825
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,930
<31-14,MARTHA>两个象和一个卒  这能代表什么呢
<31-14,MARTHA>Two bishops and a pawn. What could it mean?

826
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,340
<31-15,CASTLE>我也不知道
<31-15,CASTLE>I don't know. Ohh.

827
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,000
<31-16,MARTHA>我一直在研究经典的棋路
<31-16,MARTHA>I've been looking up classic strategies.

828
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,530
<31-17,CASTLE>我看了菲舍尔  卡尔波夫
<31-17,CASTLE>I've looked up famous chess matches

829
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,240
<31-17,CASTLE>这些象棋大师的比赛
<31-17,CASTLE>with Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov,

830
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,210
<31-17,CASTLE>但都没发现这个阵局
<31-17,CASTLE>but this pattern never occurs.

831
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,500
<31-18,MARTHA>也许棋子跟国际象棋一点关系也没有
<31-18,MARTHA>Maybe the pieces have nothing to do with the chess game.

832
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,430
<31-18,MARTHA>也许它们代表了一些跟国际象棋完全
<31-18,MARTHA>Maybe the pieces represent something else...

833
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,010
<31-18,MARTHA>无关的东西
<31-18,MARTHA>entirely.

834
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,000
<32-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特
<32-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

835
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,690
<32-1,ESPOSITO>我没查到关于盖奇的线索  但记得你让我
<32-1,ESPOSITO>Nothing on Gage, but remember you asked me

836
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,420
<32-1,ESPOSITO>去查特雷西·麦格拉和一个叫做
<32-1,ESPOSITO>to look for a link between Tracy Mcgrath

837
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,050
<32-1,ESPOSITO>尼尔森·布莱克利的家伙之间的联系对吧
<32-1,ESPOSITO>and some guy named Nelson Blakely?

838
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,620
<32-2,BECKETT>没错
<32-2,BECKETT>Yeah.

839
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,730
<32-3,ESPOSITO>我发现了二人在十年前有关联
<32-3,ESPOSITO>I found one from ten years ago.

840
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,660
<32-3,ESPOSITO>特雷西曾和一帮她研究生朋友
<32-3,ESPOSITO>Tracy and a bunch of her grad student friends

841
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,210
<32-3,ESPOSITO>跟他们的教授  布莱克利博士
<32-3,ESPOSITO>went on a white-water rafting trip

842
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,800
<32-3,ESPOSITO>一同去浅滩漂流
<32-3,ESPOSITO>with a Dr. Blakely, their professor,

843
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,440
<32-3,ESPOSITO>不过他很不走运
<32-3,ESPOSITO>although it wasn't a good time for him.

844
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
<32-3,ESPOSITO>他在旅行中溺水丧生了
<32-3,ESPOSITO>He drowned during the trip.

845
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,630
<32-3,ESPOSITO>这么说他伪造了自己的死亡
<32-3,ESPOSITO>So he faked his death

846
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,270
<32-4,BECKETT>而特雷西也参与了
<32-4,BECKETT>and Tracy was in on it.

847
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,050
<32-5,ESPOSITO>谁装死  布莱克利吗
<32-5,ESPOSITO>Who faked his death -- Blakely?

848
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,260
<32-6,BECKETT>抱歉
<32-6,BECKETT>Uh...I'm sorry.

849
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,640
<32-6,BECKETT>不能告诉你
<32-6,BECKETT>I can't tell you.

850
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,280
<32-7,ESPOSITO>男人的忍耐是有限的
<32-7,ESPOSITO>You know, a man can only take so much.

851
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,300
<32-9,BECKETT>-你怎么来了  -我有所发现
<32-9,BECKETT>- Hey. What are you doing here?  - I found something.

852
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,830
<32-10,CASTLE>是关于布莱克利的
<32-10,CASTLE>It's about Blakely.

853
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,080
<32-11,BECKETT>你不是应该去告诉索菲亚吗
<32-11,BECKETT>Well, shouldn't you tell Sophia about it?

854
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,930
<32-12,CASTLE>她又不是我搭档
<32-12,CASTLE>She isn't my partner.

855
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,450
<32-12,CASTLE>你才是
<32-12,CASTLE>You are.

856
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,070
<32-13,CASTLE>我可以坐下吗
<32-13,CASTLE>May I?

857
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,300
<32-13,CASTLE>好吧
<32-13,CASTLE>All right.

858
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,860
<32-14,CASTLE>象  象  卒
<32-14,CASTLE>Bishop, bishop, pawn.

859
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,600
<32-14,CASTLE>我们知道布莱克利是个世界级的国际象棋大师
<32-14,CASTLE>We know Blakely was a world-class chess player.

860
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,770
<32-14,CASTLE>特雷西·麦格拉也下象棋  她有计时器
<32-14,CASTLE>Tracy McGrath played, too. She had a game timer.

861
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,770
<32-14,CASTLE>但是这种摆法根本毫无战术意义
<32-14,CASTLE>Yet, this placement makes no tactical sense.

862
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,050
<32-15,BECKETT>我猜你是有所发现了
<32-15,BECKETT>I'm guessing you got a theory?

863
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,330
<32-16,CASTLE>我认为这些棋子跟国际象棋本身没有关系
<32-16,CASTLE>I don't think the pieces have anything to do with the game.

864
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,310
<32-16,CASTLE>我认为布莱克利是给特雷西留下了一条加密的口信
<32-16,CASTLE>I think Blakely was leaving Tracy a coded message,

865
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,760
<32-16,CASTLE>告诉她去哪里找他
<32-16,CASTLE>telling her where to meet him.

866
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,850
<32-16,CASTLE>甚至有可能是他们下象棋的地方
<32-16,CASTLE>Maybe even a place where they play chess.

867
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,070
<32-17,BECKETT>好吧  大家经常在公园里下象棋
<32-17,BECKETT>Okay, well, uh, people play chess in parks.

868
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,870
<32-17,BECKETT>中心公园  华盛顿广场公园
<32-17,BECKETT>Uh, Central Park, Washington Square Park --

869
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,870
<32-17,BECKETT>这些都是跟人见面的好地方
<32-17,BECKETT>those would be great places to meet up with someone

870
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,060
<32-17,BECKETT>同时又不会引人注意
<32-17,BECKETT>without drawing attention.

871
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,140
<32-18,CASTLE>没错  要是每个棋子
<32-18,CASTLE>Exactly. Now what if each piece

872
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,250
<32-18,CASTLE>都代表了一个英文单词的首字母呢
<32-18,CASTLE>stood for the first letter of a word?

873
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,800
<32-18,CASTLE>象代表B  卒代表P
<32-18,CASTLE>Bishop for "B," pawn for "P"?

874
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,290
<32-19,BECKETT>好吧  字母B然后空七格
<32-19,BECKETT>Okay, "B" and then seven spaces,

875
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,780
<32-19,BECKETT>有可能是
<32-19,BECKETT>that could be...

876
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,690
<32-19,BECKETT>布鲁克林
<32-19,BECKETT>Brooklyn.

877
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,460
<32-19,BECKETT>布莱克利的电话就是从布鲁克林打出来的
<32-19,BECKETT>And Blakely made his phone call from Brooklyn.

878
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,510
<32-19,BECKETT>那就是布鲁克林  BBP
<32-19,BECKETT>So Brooklyn -- b-b-p.

879
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,260
<32-19,BECKETT>布鲁克林桥公园吗
<32-19,BECKETT>Uh, Brooklyn... Bridge Park?

880
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,650
<32-20,CASTLE>他们定在五点见  也就是半个小时以后
<32-20,CASTLE>That meeting is at 5:00. That's in half an hour.

881
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,470
<32-20,CASTLE>如果布莱克利去了  我们就能查明潘朵拉是什么
<32-20,CASTLE>If Blakely shows, we can find out what Pandora is

882
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,290
<32-20,CASTLE>还可以找到盖奇
<32-20,CASTLE>and we can find Gage.

883
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,880
<32-20,CASTLE>你觉得怎么样
<32-20,CASTLE>What do you say?

884
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,500
<33-1,BECKETT>布莱克利现在该到了
<33-1,BECKETT>Blakely should've been here by now.

885
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,900
<33-1,BECKETT>也许他知道特雷西已经死了
<33-1,BECKETT>Maybe he knows that Tracy's dead

886
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,170
<33-1,BECKETT>又或者盖奇已经杀了他
<33-1,BECKETT>or maybe Gage already killed him.

887
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,890
<33-2,CASTLE>我选择心存希望
<33-2,CASTLE>I choose the audacity of hope.

888
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,790
<33-2,CASTLE>照我看他会出现的
<33-2,CASTLE>I say, he'll be here.

889
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,170
<33-3,BECKETT>那你不是应该打给索菲亚吗
<33-3,BECKETT>Well, then shouldn't you call Sophia?

890
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,440
<33-4,CASTLE>要是我推理错误不就糗大了吗
<33-4,CASTLE>And look like an ass if I'm wrong?

891
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,950
<33-5,BECKETT>我不得不承认  我有点惊讶
<33-5,BECKETT>You know, I have to admit, I'm actually kind of surprised

892
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,760
<33-5,BECKETT>你以前居然从来都没有提过她
<33-5,BECKETT>that you've never mentioned her before.

893
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,330
<33-6,CASTLE>我不能说
<33-6,CASTLE>I wasn't allowed to.

894
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,460
<33-6,CASTLE>她是中情局的在职特工
<33-6,CASTLE>She is an active CIA agent.

895
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,210
<33-7,BECKETT>这样啊
<33-7,BECKETT>I see.

896
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,510
<33-8,CASTLE>要是你愿意的话
<33-8,CASTLE>Look, if you want,

897
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,270
<33-8,CASTLE>我可以回答你关于她的任何问题
<33-8,CASTLE>I will answer any question you have about her --

898
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,140
<33-8,CASTLE>你问什么都行
<33-8,CASTLE>Anything at all.

899
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,880
<33-9,BECKETT>不用了  谢谢
<33-9,BECKETT>No. Thanks.

900
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
<33-10,CASTLE>你确定吗
<33-10,CASTLE>Are you sure?

901
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,750
<33-11,BECKETT>确定  她的事跟我无关
<33-11,BECKETT>Yeah, I mean, it's really none of my business.

902
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,990
<33-12,CASTLE>好吧  那这件事就到此为止了
<33-12,CASTLE>Okay. Well, we're done with it then.

903
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,240
<33-13,BECKETT>好的
<33-13,BECKETT>Fine.

904
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,220
<33-13,BECKETT>那
<33-13,BECKETT>So...

905
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,800
<33-14,BECKETT>你们俩的关系到底有多亲密
<33-14,BECKETT>how close were the two of you exactly?

906
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,790
<33-15,CASTLE>他来了
<33-15,CASTLE>There he is.

907
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,370
<33-16,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  是你自己说我可以随便问的
<33-16,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. You said I could ask you anything.

908
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,390
<33-17,CASTLE>不  我说真的  他来了
<33-17,CASTLE>No, seriously. There he is.

909
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,650
<33-18,BECKETT>布莱克利博士
<33-18,BECKETT>Dr. Blakely.

910
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,140
<33-18,BECKETT>恐怕你认错人了
<33-18,BECKETT>I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else.

911
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,300
<33-19,BECKETT>不  我没认错
<33-19,BECKETT>No, there is no mistake.

912
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,630
<33-20,BLAKELY>你是怎么找到我的
<33-20,BLAKELY>How did you find me?

913
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,100
<33-21,BECKETT>通过特雷西
<33-21,BECKETT>Through Tracy.

914
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,070
<33-21,BECKETT>她已经死了
<33-21,BECKETT>She's dead.

915
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:40,840
<33-22,BLAKELY>如果他们能找到她  他们就能找到我
<33-22,BLAKELY>If they got to her, they can get to me.

916
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,730
<33-22,BLAKELY>我们得马上离开这儿
<33-22,BLAKELY>We need to leave here now.

917
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,100
<34-1,BLAKELY>我早就知道会有这么一天
<34-1,BLAKELY>I always knew this day would come.

918
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,320
<34-1,BLAKELY>但是特雷西
<34-1,BLAKELY>But Tracy...

919
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,130
<34-2,BECKETT>布莱克利博士  到底是怎么回事
<34-2,BECKETT>Dr. Blakely, what's going on?

920
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,620
<34-2,BECKETT>潘朵拉是什么
<34-2,BECKETT>What's Pandora?

921
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,430
<34-3,BLAKELY>我需要你开车带我去32号码头
<34-3,BLAKELY>I need you to drive me to Pier 32.

922
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,760
<34-4,BECKETT>你现在没有讨价还价的资本
<34-4,BECKETT>You're not in a position to bargain here.

923
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,400
<34-5,BLAKELY>我是自愿上车的  如果你不带我去我想去的地方
<34-5,BLAKELY>I got in this car voluntarily, and I'll get right back out

924
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,130
<34-5,BLAKELY>我就马上下车
<34-5,BLAKELY>if you don't take me where I want to go.

925
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,240
<34-6,CASTLE>32号码头有什么
<34-6,CASTLE>Okay, what's at Pier 32?

926
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,400
<34-7,BLAKELY>我们一到那儿
<34-7,BLAKELY>Once we're there,

927
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,470
<34-7,BLAKELY>我一定知无不言
<34-7,BLAKELY>I'll tell you what you want to know.

928
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,720
<34-8,CASTLE>你是你所处领域的佼佼者
<34-8,CASTLE>You were top of your field,

929
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,490
<34-8,CASTLE>还是教授兼中情局的顾问
<34-8,CASTLE>a professor, an advisor for the CIA.

930
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,290
<34-8,CASTLE>为什么要伪造自己的死亡呢
<34-8,CASTLE>Why fake your own death?

931
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,110
<34-9,BLAKELY>我为了中情局毁掉了不少国家
<34-9,BLAKELY>I brought down nations for the agency.

932
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,140
<34-9,BLAKELY>我扮演了上帝的角色  但是
<34-9,BLAKELY>I played God, but...

933
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,570
<34-9,BLAKELY>我的关键理论没考虑到人力的消耗
<34-9,BLAKELY>my Linchpin theory didn't factor in the human cost.

934
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,840
<34-9,BLAKELY>我知道他们永远都不会让我离开  只好装死
<34-9,BLAKELY>I knew they'd never let me leave, so I died

935
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,710
<34-9,BLAKELY>再重生
<34-9,BLAKELY>and was reborn.

936
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,790
<34-10,CASTLE>唯一的知情人就是特雷西吗
<34-10,CASTLE>And the only one who knew was Tracy?

937
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,340
<34-11,BLAKELY>她是我赖以生存的生命线
<34-11,BLAKELY>She was my lifeline.

938
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,500
<34-11,BLAKELY>她把顾问工作的方向转到了我的理论上
<34-11,BLAKELY>She steered consulting work my way.

939
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,970
<34-11,BLAKELY>我曾帮助非洲减低霍乱发生率
<34-11,BLAKELY>I helped reduce cholera in Africa.

940
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,020
<34-11,BLAKELY>我曾预言只要有一次非暴力反抗
<34-11,BLAKELY>I predicted that a lone act of civil disobedience

941
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,250
<34-11,BLAKELY>就会引发阿拉伯世界的起义和重组
<34-11,BLAKELY>would trigger an uprising and remake the Arab world.

942
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,120
<34-11,BLAKELY>我干过一些好事
<34-11,BLAKELY>I-I did good things.

943
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,280
<34-11,BLAKELY>是谁杀了特雷西
<34-11,BLAKELY>Who killed her?

944
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,220
<34-12,BECKETT>和想要启动潘朵拉的是一个人
<34-12,BECKETT>The same man that's trying to pull off Pandora.

945
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,760
<34-13,BLAKELY>你是说他们想要实施那个计划吗
<34-13,BLAKELY>You mean, they're trying to make it happen?

946
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,080
<34-13,BLAKELY>这比我想象的还要严重
<34-13,BLAKELY>This is even worse than I thought.

947
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,300
<35-1,BECKETT>好了  交代吧
<35-1,BECKETT>All right, talk.

948
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,950
<35-2,BLAKELY>我得先进去
<35-2,BLAKELY>I need to go inside first.

949
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,910
<35-3,BECKETT>你不老实交代潘朵拉的事  就哪也别想去
<35-3,BECKETT>You're not going anywhere until you tell me about Pandora.

950
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,170
<35-3,BECKETT>潘朵拉是什么
<35-3,BECKETT>What is it?

951
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,820
<35-4,BLAKELY>是我起草的一份白皮书的名字
<35-4,BLAKELY>It was the name of a white paper that I wrote.

952
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,950
<35-5,CASTLE>为谁起草的
<35-5,CASTLE>For whom?

953
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,650
<35-6,BLAKELY>一个智囊机构曾雇我
<35-6,BLAKELY>I was hired by a think tank

954
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,450
<35-6,BLAKELY>来分析美国安全系统的弱点
<35-6,BLAKELY>to identify weaknesses in U.S. security

955
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,420
<35-6,BLAKELY>以便他们对发现的弱点进行巩固和维护
<35-6,BLAKELY>so they could be shored up, protected.

956
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,500
<35-6,BLAKELY>我发现了一个令人担忧的弱点
<35-6,BLAKELY>I found an alarming vulnerability --

957
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,500
<35-6,BLAKELY>一个与经济相关的关键
<35-6,BLAKELY>a linchpin that was tied to the economy

958
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,950
<35-6,BLAKELY>能造成我们前所未见的
<35-6,BLAKELY>that would cause crisis and devastation

959
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,200
<35-6,BLAKELY>危机和破坏
<35-6,BLAKELY>beyond anything we'd ever seen.

960
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,970
<35-6,BLAKELY>多米诺骨牌会永不停歇地倒下去
<35-6,BLAKELY>The dominos would just never stop falling.

961
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,300
<35-6,BLAKELY>我让特雷西去跟进这个智囊团的进展情况
<35-6,BLAKELY>I asked Tracy to follow up with the think tank,

962
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,450
<35-6,BLAKELY>但却发现他们并不存在
<35-6,BLAKELY>but they don't exist.

963
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,910
<35-6,BLAKELY>不管他们是谁  我把会给美国
<35-6,BLAKELY>Whoever they are, I gave them the blueprint

964
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,150
<35-6,BLAKELY>带来毁灭的蓝图交给了他们
<35-6,BLAKELY>that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.

965
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,660
<35-6,BLAKELY>布莱克利博士
<35-6,BLAKELY>Dr. Blakely,

966
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,250
<35-7,CASTLE>关键是什么
<35-7,CASTLE>what is the linchpin?

967
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,210
<35-8,BLAKELY>怎么会有一群鸽子呢
<35-8,BLAKELY>A flock of pigeons?

968
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,980
<35-9,BECKETT>布莱克利  你所谓的关键到底是什么
<35-9,BECKETT>Blakely, the linchpin, what is it?

969
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,390
<35-10,BLAKELY>鸽子除非逃避捕食者的追击
<35-10,BLAKELY>Pigeons don't fly in flocks

970
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,150
<35-10,BLAKELY>不然它们是不会成群逃窜的
<35-10,BLAKELY>unless they're fleeing a predator.

971
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,560
<35-10,BLAKELY>他们来了
<35-10,BLAKELY>They're here.

972
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,270
<35-11,BECKETT>等一下  等等
<35-11,BECKETT>Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait!

973
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,590
<35-12,CASTLE>布莱克利
<35-12,CASTLE>Hey! Blakely!

974
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,210
<35-14,BECKETT>挺住
<35-14,BECKETT>Come on. Come on!

975
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,080
<35-15,BECKETT>-贝克特  -抓稳了  卡塞尔
<35-15,BECKETT>- Beckett!  - Hold on, Castle.

<35-15,BECKETT>-抓稳了  -刹车  贝克特
<35-15,BECKETT>- Hold on!  - Brake! Beckett!
