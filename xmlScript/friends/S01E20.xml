<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, that is so sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I feel violated. And not in a good way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>So have you called her yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Joey and Ross</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Her answer machine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>So, uh, why didn't you say anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Okay, okay, what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Okay, they're just talking...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What? What? What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Oh!... Right!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey Rach!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>How'd it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Not a good day for birds...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>That's, that's nice twice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Duh, where've you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I have my reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Nooo, it wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content> Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hey, I've been honing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>What was with the dishes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content> Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Great, now he's waving back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>What kinda stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>You cook naked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.</content></utterance>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>No, it was. It was very very good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Well, what about Mindy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Oh, way, way better than Mindy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Bernice</speaker><content> Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content> Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I had a bra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Bobby</speaker><content>Hey, Dr. Farber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Barry</speaker><content>All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Can I use your phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Joey</speaker><content>Maybe she never got your message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>...desperate, needy, pathetic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How many beeps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>She answered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>All</speaker><content>Hey! Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>How'd he take it?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>Monica</speaker><content>You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>You-you had what?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>If it helps, I could slide over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content>It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>Phoebe</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>Ross</speaker><content> I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>Chandler</speaker><content>Hello? Hello?</content></utterance>

Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Mindy</speaker><content>Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content> Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Mindy</speaker><content>Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What? What's what you were afraid of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Mindy</speaker><content>Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Mindy</speaker><content>I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>Rachel</speaker><content>Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.</content></utterance>
