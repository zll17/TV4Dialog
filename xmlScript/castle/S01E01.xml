<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATHERINE BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Alison Tisdale. 24. Grad student at NYU, part of the social work program.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nice place for a social worker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Daddy's money. Neighbours called to complain about the music - when she didn't answer they had the super check on...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No signs of struggle. He knew her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>He even bought her flowers. Who says romance is dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I do, every Saturday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, lipstick wouldn't hurt.  I'm just sayin'...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what did he give her besides roses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Two shots to the chest. Small calibre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does this look familiar to anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, but I'm not the one with a thing for freaky ones. Just give me a Jack shot Jill over Bill so I can get my collar and go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, but the freaky ones require more. They reveal more. Look at how he left her: covered modestly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, despite all of the effort, all of the preparation, you won't find any evidence of sexual abuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You really get that from just this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This. Plus, I've seen this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You've seen it before. Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Roses on her body? Sunflowers on her eyes? Don't you guys read?!</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>What kind of idiot kills off his best-selling main character?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you asking me as my blood-sucking publisher or my blood-sucking ex-wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Oh, is that what you're doing? Punishing me by killing the golden goose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, c'mon, I may be petty and shortsighted, but I'm not that petty and shortsighted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Really? Then why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Writing Derrick used to be fun. Now it's like work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>God forbid you should work. You could have retired him. You could have crippled him. You could have had him join the friggin’ circus. But no, you had to put a bullet through his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, real messy too. Big exit wound. Don't worry, Derrick Storm is not the golden goose here, I am. I wrote half a dozen best sellers before him. What makes you think I'll stop now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>I don't know, the fact the new book was due nine weeks ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can't rush genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Genius, Richard? Try blockage. I heard you haven't written in months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>My sources are very reliable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, they're wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>They better be. If I don't have a new manuscript on my desk in the next three weeks, Black Pawn is prepared to demand the return of your advance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wouldn't dare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Try me. Just try me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know I already returned that advance; I spent it divorcing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Really, doll-face, who does homework at a party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I have a test next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So do I -- liver function. You don't see me studying.  All right, give me a hit of the bubbly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Make that two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Hey, kiddo, sales must be slippin', they're only serving the soft stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, sweetie. So, Mother--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Shh Shh Shh! Not so loud, I'm still hoping to get lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you tell Gina I was having trouble writing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, I told her nothing of the sort. ...I may have said something about spending your days moping in your underwear waiting for post time at Belmont, but hey, you're an artist, it's expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We had a deal; I let you live with us, but you don't talk about my work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What's to talk about? You haven't done any since I've moved in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, he hasn't!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever I have and haven't done, I would just appreciate it if you wouldn't share it with my ex-wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, what's the big deal--Hang on, sweetie, I just got a hit on my grey-dar. Bingo! No ring. Stand back kids, mama's goin' fishin'. Ha ha ha...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You should have me committed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>For what? Letting her move in? I think it's sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It won't be when I strangle her. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You know I'm only fifteen, right? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're an old soul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, well, me and my soul can wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When I was your age... I can't tell that story, it's wildly inappropriate, which, oddly is my point. Don't you want to have wildly inappropriate stories that you can't tell your children?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I think you have enough of those for the both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Life should be an adventure. You want to know why I killed Derrick? There were no more surprises. I knew exactly what was going to happen every moment of every scene. It's just like these parties - they've become so predictable. 'I'm your biggest fan!' ' Where do you get your ideas?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And the ever popular, 'Will you sign my "chest?"'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That one I don't mind so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, well, FYI, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just once I'd like someone to come up to me and say something new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Where would you like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions about a murder that took place earlier tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That's new.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. You've got quite a rap sheet for a best-selling author: disorderly conduct, resisting arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Boys will be boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It says here that you stole a police horse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Borrowed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah. And you were nude at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was spring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And every time the charges were dropped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What can I say? The mayor is a fan, but if it makes you feel any better, I'd be happy to let you spank me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. This whole bad-boy charm thing that you've got going, might work for bimbettes and celebutantes. Me? I work for a living. So that makes you one of two things in my world: either the guy who makes my life easier, or the guy who makes my life harder. And trust me, you do not want to be the guy who makes my life harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>'kay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alison Tisdale. Daughter of real estate mogul Jonathan Tisdale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's dead. Did you ever meet her? Book signing? Charity event?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's possible. She's not in my little black book, if that's what you're asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about this guy? Marvin Fisk. Small claims lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Most of my claims tend to be on the...um... large side. So what's this got to do with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fisk was found murdered in his office two weeks ago. I didn't put it together until I saw the Tisdale crime scene tonight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Flowers For Your Grave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And this is how we found Marvin Fisk, right out of Hell Hath No Fury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like I have a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, a really deranged fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you don't look deranged to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hell Hath No Fury? Angry wiccans out for blood? C'mon! Only hardcore Castle groupies read that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do any of these groupies ever write you letters? Disturbing letters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, all my fan mail is disturbing. It's an occupational hazard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because, sometimes in cases like this, we find that the -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>...contact the subject of his obsession. I'm also pretty well versed in psychopathic methodologies. Another occupational hazard. And do you know, you have gorgeous eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I take it that you won't have any objection to us going through your mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Knock yourself out. Can I get copies of those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Copies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have this poker game, it's mostly other writers, Patterson, Cannell, you know, bestsellers. You have no idea how jealous those would make them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That I have a copycat. Oh my gosh, in my world that's the red badge of honor. That's the criminal Cooperstown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>People are dead, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm not asking for the bodies, just the pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think we're done here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> I'm just a gal who can't say no. I'm in a terrible fix. I always say "C'mon let's go, just when I ought’a" -- hey! Kiddo! I'm just showing Bert here how we did it at the Palace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does he know it's your theme song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BERT</speaker><content>Ready to bring it home, Ducky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yay. Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BERT</speaker><content>Five, six, seven, eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> I'm just a fool when lights are low...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're missing the late show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I saw it in previews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We got a new lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>His name is Bert. He does magic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let's hope he disappears by morning. C’est après minuit dans un school night. Don't you turn into a pumpkin or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Not when your dad's been escorted away by cops. How was the slammer? Anyone make you their b*itch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry, Switchblade, I still belong to you.  Baby bird?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Already brushed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your loss. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So are you going to tell me about it or do I have to look it up on the fan sites?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, we had a deal. Surf all the Internet you want, but stay off the fan sites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Seriously dad, are you in some kind of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Despite my best efforts, no. They want my help on a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently, somebody's been killing people the way I kill them in my books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That's horrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How many?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two, so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, just so senseless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Murder usually is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nope, murder usually makes a great deal of sense: passion, greed, politics. But senseless here is the books the killer chose. Hell Hath No Fury, Flowers for Your Grave, my truly lesser works. Why would a psychotic fan pick those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Maybe because he's psychotic? C'mon, it's bedtime. You can figure it out in the morning.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What are those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle's greatest hits. You're gonna familiarize yourselves with all of his murder scenes so we don't miss any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Got any on tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>First victim, male. Lawyer. Second victim, female social worker. Somewhere in these books, those two are connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> From the library of Katherine Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have a problem with reading, Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, check it, girl, you're totally a fan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. Of the genre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right. Of the genre. That's why you're blushing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What are you, twelve? Profiling indicates a perp with low intelligence, someone who has -- or thinks he has -- a personal relationship with our author. So that's where we start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I work dead bodies all day, the last thing I want to do when I go home is read murder books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Aren't you curious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Curious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About how people can do these kinds of things to one another? Whoever did this read Castle's books, and somewhere in those pages is the answer to where he'll strike next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>OTHER COP</speaker><content>Is all that Castle's mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His fans love him almost as much as he loves himself.  Can you take that back to briefing, please? Did we hear back from the lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Scene was negative for DNA and prints -- just like Fisk. Guy's careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about Tisdale and Fisk, any connection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Other than your boy there? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What's he doin' here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe he likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain. Yes, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Mr. Castle has offered to assist with the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's the least I can do for the city I love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Considering the nature of the crime scenes, I think it's a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, can I talk to you for a minute. In private?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. No, it's just the way your brow furrows when you're thinking... It's cute. I mean, not if you're playing poker. Then it'd be deadly, but otherwise...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can I ask you a question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why are you here? You don't care about the victims, so you aren't here for justice. You don't care that the guy's aping your books, so you aren't here 'cause you're outraged. So what is it, Rick? Are you here to annoy me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm here for the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why those people? Why those murders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sometimes, there is no story. Sometimes the guy is just a psychopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's always a story. Always a chain of events makes everything make sense. Take you for example. Under normal circumstances, you should not be here. Most smart, good-looking women become lawyers, not cops. And, yet, here you are. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't know, Rick. You're the novelist. You tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you're not bridge-and-tunnel -- no trace of the boroughs when you talk, so that means Manhattan. That means money. You went to college. Probably a pretty good one. You had options. Yeah, you had lots of options. Better options. More socially acceptable options. And you still chose this. That tells me something happened. Not to you, you're wounded, but you're not that wounded. And it was someone you cared about. It was someone you loved. And you probably could have lived with that, but the person responsible was never caught.  And that, Detective Beckett, is why you're here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cute trick. But don't think you know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The point is, there's always a story, you just have to find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think I just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shot anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you ever shoot a guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Lab's got lifts off the letter.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I don't know where you went. We looked all over for you. You took up with that girl - </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Man's got the mayor on speed dial. The rich really are different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want him? He's yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A control freak like you with something you can't control? No no no, that's going to be more fun than Shark Week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, you'll have your prints in an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Castle? Half of the guys here are waiting for prints. You don't just jump the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I think somebody feels threatened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm not threatened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, I get it. I can call the mayor and you can't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have procedure. Protocol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, and you always come to a complete stop at a red light, and you never fudge your taxes. Tell me something, you ever have any fun? You know, let your hair down, drop your top, a little Cops Gone Wild?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You do know I'm wearing a gun?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>COP</speaker><content>Maintenance found her an hour ago. Kendra Pitney, she lives in the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let's get her out of the water.  Um, you just stay here, and don't touch anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi, I'm Richard Castle. I'm consulting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Richard Castle, the author?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>On my better days. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Lanie Parish, Medical Examiner. I love your books. You know, you have a real gift with the details of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought I told you to stay over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got lonely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You got a C.O.D.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not until I do the full exam, but this wasn't a stabbing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lack of blood around the wound suggests she was dead before it was inserted. No foam around the mouth, so we know she didn't drown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh, you're good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, she was killed first then posed, just like the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. Can I have a word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a homicide investigation, not a day at Disneyland. If I give you an order, I expect you to obey it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then you don't know me very well. You know, in my book, the dress was blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don't try to change the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Tisdale and Fisk know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We haven't found a connection. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about motive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's a serial killer; he doesn't need motive.  Beckett. They got a match off the print. Kyle Cabot. He's in Brooklyn. We got him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>EXT</speaker><content>CABOT RESIDENCE</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stay here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>OTHER COP</speaker><content>Beckett, you gotta see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! That's creepy!  I was never a Scout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alison's blouse. I'm guessing he kept trophies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>22 calibre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Show me your hands!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's still not speaking. State medical records indicate he's got pervasive developmental disorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that explains his fixation with me. PDD sometimes manifests as an obsession with a single subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, your super fan also has a history of delusions.  Guess who his social worker was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alison Tisdale!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Her files indicate he was on some pretty heavy anti-psychotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Limited intelligence. Thinks he has a personal relationship with his hero, looks like the profile was right, Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what? That's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What more do you want? Evidence is in his apartment, we can connect him with the three victims. Two from the diner where he worked, and Tisdale was his social worker. Call the D.A. Get him legal aid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> it's too easy! The reader would never buy it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This isn't one of your books, Castle. Out here, we find a guy standing over a body with a gun, he's usually the guy who did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know this kid was in and out of the system for years. It doesn't seem like he ever got the proper treatment til Alison Tisdale took over his case file. She's the one who got him a job at the diner, and her notes seem to say he was doing okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, we can let the D.A. worry about all that now. Our job is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, um, can you leave the box? I'll take care of it tomorrow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>Castle, I'm kinda glad that you killed off Storm -- less competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>Twenty to you, Cannell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>Cough up some of that TV money and you'll find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>I know that look. Story trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>You don't see me putting a bullet through Alex Cross's head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you know what, just for that I'm going to call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>So what's the problem, Ricky? Maybe we can help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm working on this thing. It starts with a famous author. Some psycho starts staging murders like the way he does in his books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>This is Castle we're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, crime scenes are clean. Doesn't leave any fingerprints, doesn't leave any DNA, but the psycho writes the author a fan letter with his prints all over it. Well, that leads the cops to his apartment where they find enough evidence to convict him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, they arrest him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>That's terrible. No wonder you're blocked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>JAMES PATTERSON</speaker><content>Where's a twist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, right, like maybe someone set this kid up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I have just the guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's a novelist’s habit to poke through other people's mail, check in their medicine cabinets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why are you still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just came by to give you this. A little something to memorialize our brief partnership. Don't look so suspicious, go on, open it. . I got you an advance copy. I even signed it to you. Not that you're a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks, that's actually kinda sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was nice to have met you, Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He didn't.  Oh, he did!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Richard Castle, you are under arrest for felony, theft, and obstruction of justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You forgot making you look bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, for a minute there, you actually made me believe that you were human. Cuff him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, bondage! My safe word is apples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh, there's no need to be gentle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you find me anyways?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm a detective, that's what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My mother told you, didn't you? By the way, the rose petals in the Tisdale murder are grandiflora, not hybrid teas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll make a note of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you probably should, since it means Kyle Cabot is innocent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Thank you, officer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hello, Father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello, Daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I wish I could say I was surprised. It's my fault, really. He never had a father figure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that's not true, Mother. I had lots of father figures. I see you've met Captain Montgomery and Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And they have agreed to drop the charges, if you agree to behave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>No more interference with this case, Mr. Castle. Do we understand each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. But you still got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> I really. Must you always...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nah. Nonono, don't tell me he got to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please, he didn't get to me. She did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Alison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Marvin Fisk, first murder. Kyle knew him from the diner. Then he kills Alison, his social worker, and then he kills Kendra Pitney, also from the diner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, he starts with a murder of convenience, and then escalates to a murder of someone he knows very well, and then goes back to a murder of convenience. It doesn't make any sense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Somebody set up Kyle to take the fall. Somebody who knew enough about his fixation with me to use it to get away with murder. That means we're not looking for a serial killer, we're looking for a good-old-fashioned murderer. Someone with motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You think the victims were somehow related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Police would have found it by now. Now, if I were writing the story, the killer would have wanted only one of the victims dead. He would have killed the other ones just to cover up the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How do you get away with one murder by committing two more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At one death you look for motive, at two deaths... at two you look for a connection. At three, you look for someone like Kyle. At three, you don't need motive because mentally unstable serial killers don't usually have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That makes about as much sense as Mousetrap. I did that play eight times a week for a year. I still have no idea what it's about.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle was right. If he was trying to follow his books, then the roses on Alison's body were wrong, and Fisk should have been suffocated by a plastic bag, not strangled with a necktie. And Kendra's dress should have been blue, not yellow. For an obsessive, it would have been impossible not to get the details right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, if it wasn't him, then who was it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The killer had to have known both his intended victim and Kyle fairly well. Only victim that had any real knowledge of Kyle's obsessive condition would have been Alison Tisdale.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alison's the key, she's the one that the killer is trying to hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>As far as we know, she wasn't seeing anyone and none of her other case files fit the profile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, somebody had to know something about her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if the killer found out about Kyle through Alison, then Alison must have been the intended target. Somebody wanted Alison dead. Just have to figure out why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>If I have to keep bailing you out, you're going to have to raise my allowance. By a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mine too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi, I'm Rick Castle. I have an appointment to see Mr. Tisdale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Yes. Mr. Castle. He's expecting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is he, now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is not what it looks like...this... Okay, this is exactly what it looks like, but I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You comin'?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Alison ever mention having enemies or being threatened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>JONATHAN TISDALE</speaker><content>People loved her. All she wanted was to make the world a better place. I told all of this to the other detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know, sir, we're just following up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Alison know anybody who could have profited from her death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>JONATHAN TISDALE</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, I may be rich, but my daughter was not. She abhorred money. What little she had, she gave to charity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Tisdale, Fortune magazine estimated your net worth at nearly 100 million dollars. Is that true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>JONATHAN TISDALE</speaker><content>I don't check day to day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But it's in the ballpark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>JONATHAN TISDALE</speaker><content>I've been lucky, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Appreciate your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happens to all that money if something happens to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>JONATHAN TISDALE</speaker><content>Half of my estate goes to my charitable foundation and the rest to my children. I mean, my son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was that all about?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who's dying? Tisdale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Want a hot dog? I want a hot dog. What do you take on your... ..Ow. Ow. Apples, apples, apples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What makes you think he's dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ugh. See those pictures in his office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's much thinner now. Like sick thin, not work out thin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His daughter was just murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the way he kept touching his hair, like he's self-conscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He wears a piece?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's a good one, but it's new to him. Chemo's relatively recent. And he was wearing makeup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's trying to look healthier than he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doesn't want his shareholders to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he's got cancer, that doesn't mean that he's terminal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But it's a much better story if he is. You interview the brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There was never a reason to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Kate Beckett. Rick Castle. We'd like to ask you some questions about your sister.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>Yeah, anything I can do. Let's head inside. Last time I saw her, about a month ago at Dad's, you know, I still can't believe she's gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>Everybody loved her. My sister she just wanted to see the best in people. Even that kid who killed her. You know she did everything she could to help that guy. Even brought him around here once to see if I could get him a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>I can't afford to, all right? My employees mess up, I lose my bond. I don't know. Maybe if I'd helped him things would be different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did your sister react when your dad told you he was dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>She was upset. We both were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now that she's dead, your inheritance stands to double.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>What are you suggesting? You already caught the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we did. But the first things his lawyers will do is shift suspicion to someone else. Someone with motive. Then they'll stick me on the stand and ask me why I didn't investigate and then the jury will have doubts. And we don't want them to have doubts, do we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you'll have to excuse me for asking, but where were you the night of your sister's murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>I was traveling. On business. Actually, I was out of the country for all three murders.  Here, check the stamps on that if it's useful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Absolutely unassailable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was sure it was him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, don't take it so hard. After all, you're just a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, come on. He's lying! I mean, I get him knowing where he was the night of his sister's murder, but the other two victims? He didn't pause. He didn't ask for dates. He didn't even check his calendar, but he was ready with an alibi. In my experience, innocent people do not prepare alibis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I was right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, give me the dates and flights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why can't you just admit I was right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because he totally fooled you.  He totally bought the alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had a fleeting moment of self-doubt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His credit card company confirms he paid for three roundtrip tickets. The dates coincide with the three murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So according to his credit card, Tisdale was out of the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute, now I'm not right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means the passport stamps were forged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I'm going to call passport control and have them check the logs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's, uh - not how he would have done it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got a better idea, Ricky?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Second passport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how would he get one of those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, with his money? Trust me, on the black market it'd be a piece of cake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he leaves the country on his own, comes back with the other passport, commits murder, flies out and then comes back in on his own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perfect alibi, perfect murder…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>…But almost impossible to prove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless you find the second passport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He's gotta be freaked after your little meet and greet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Keep eyeballs on him. If he moves, I wanna know. The things that people will do for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This guy kills his own sister in cold blood and killed more people to cover it up. He's either a world-class sociopath or there's a lot more to this story than just money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Judge Markway, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Markway! Tell him I say hello.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Now. Seriously, they're redoing the entire back nine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh man, I love that course. When are they going to re-open?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Judge, I hate to break up Golf Digest, but I have an exigent situation here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Very well, Detective, play through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need a search warrant. She needs a search warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For the home and office of Harrison Tisdale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Harrison Tisdale? As in Jonathan Tisdale's son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Murdered his sister and killed two more people to cover up the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Murder. The Tisdales. You better be long and straight on this one, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Harrison's father is terminally ill, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>What? I just saw him at a benefit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hope you took a picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With the sister out of the way, the son will inherit all of it.  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's also a twisted, emotional angle in there; I don't want to bore you with the details but family, and vengeance. Shakespearean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Harrison just left work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's probably heading home to destroy the evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Are you sure you can tie him to the other victims?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Through a patient of his sister's that he was trying to frame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>It's days like this I wish I was back in civil division. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.  Soon.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we got, guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>OTHER COP</speaker><content>Get this: junior's business is going under, he's tens of millions in debt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What with his sister's share of the Tisdale fortune he stands to pay off his debt and then some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, if you're going in you should be armed. My backup's in the glove compartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This time you’re staying put.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>OK. Beckett. Very funny. Joke’s over! Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cuff me once, shame on you. Cuff me twice... Shame on me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>Just a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Open the door, Harrison. Open the door. It's NYPD. We have a warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey... Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's coming down the fire escape.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easy, easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let him go, Harrison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easy, easy, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, except psycho here needs a breath mint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Hey Harrison, you know what's bothering me? If you were that deep in debt, why didn't you just ask your father for the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you are not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what I think? I think you did ask. I think you asked and he said no. I think he always said no. A self-made man like that, I bet he thought you were weak for asking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>He was the one who was weak. I was trying to make something of my life and all he cared about was her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's why you killed her. It wasn't just for the money. You wanted to punish him before he died. Take away the only thing he loved. That's a pretty good story!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Harrison, let him go. It's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>HARRISON TISDALE</speaker><content>It's not over. It's not over. Drop the gun or I swear to God, I'll--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me you saw that! You're gonna put that in your report, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can I see the cuffs, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What the hell were you thinking? You could’ve gotten yourself killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The safety was on the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you could've told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where's the fun in that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, guess this is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t have to be. We could, uh, go to dinner. Debrief each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why, Castle? So I can be another one of your conquests?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or I could be one of yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was nice to meet you, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's too bad. It would’ve been great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have no idea.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You wanted to see me, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah. I just got a call from the mayor's office. Apparently, you have a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A fan, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Rick Castle. Seems he’s found the main character for his next set of novels. A tough but savvy female detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m flattered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Don’t be. He says he has to do research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Oh yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, listen...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, he is like a nine year-old on a sugar rush... totally incapable of taking anything seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>But he did help solve this case. And when the Mayor’s happy, the Commissioner is happy, and when the Commissioner's happy, I’m happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How long, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>That’s up to him.</content></utterance>
