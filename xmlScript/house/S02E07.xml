<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Got it, you're morally outraged. Now can we get through this part? 'Cause the next part's awesome. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>How do you rationalize something like this? You broke into Stacy's therapist's office--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Borrowed a key</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>--and stole her treatment notes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nope! I made copies. Mark is, and I quote  "Withdrawn, passive-aggressive, won't communicate, like he resents me because I can walk."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>I don't want to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up. Meanwhile, she can't stop thinking about  I can't read that, is she obsessed with a Grey Horse? Or me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It says she thinks you're an annoying jerk. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a pet name.  Here's the kicker. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They're not having sex? </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Doctor cleared him, but no liftoff. She's frustrated so she's doc-blocking me. Paperwork, seminars, meddling with my patients</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Great, now you've got the proof you need. Just take those personal psych records to Cuddy, that'll show her Stacy's out of control.  You ignoring me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>While looking for my newspaper, efficient huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Over here! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Dr Wilson, I want you to meet my stalker</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Your waiting room sucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I am not treating you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>What, because you're a closet-case? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Err... we're not... err... together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> He is so self-loathing.  Well, we've got to go now, so maybe see you after work--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>No, no, no! Ah...  nobody can figure out what's wrong with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well your shirt is gaping at the collar, means you lost weight, you're flushed, that's fever, and you're short of breath. And finally there's the KS lesion on your face; means you're HIV positive, you've progressed to full-blown AIDS. So you're sick because your immune system is shot and someone sneezed on you.  Can I be excused now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Brilliant, but,  my immune system is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your concentration camp physique begs to differ. Get your T-cell count re-checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I've already done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>They test for T-cell lymphoma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>It was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>All of this will be fascinating to an HIV specialist. Now let go of my cane before it becomes your new boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Honey, I will marry it if you would look at my file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Congress says you can't, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't touch him. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He's going into anaphylactic shock.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Go see Stacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We gave him epi, he's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You need a lawyer, go see Stacy. You hit a patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Four words, two mistakes. He's not a patient, and I didn't hit him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Of course you didn't, go see Stacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I didn't cause the anaphylaxis. It's probably one of his HIV meds abacavir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I'll pass that along; make sure the ER takes him off it. Go see Stacy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You have to treat him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Medically, this case is a snooze-fest. AIDS plus infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You don't treat him he charges you with assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just 'cause he says I hit him doesn't make it true. Watch,  I am surrounded by naked cheerleaders  See?  Although I like my chances of some action this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I forgot Wednesday was hooker day. This could've waited!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You make me meet you at your house. Your husband is conveniently absent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Mark's at physio, I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator.  I saw a rat last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well, I'm surprised your feet are touching the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>I barely slept.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What was Mark up to? Memory serves, quick climb up Mt. Gregory, and you dozed through a seal hunt. Clubbing, shrieking. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What're you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Sorry, it's driving me nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You hate washing dishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>People change. I could make sure you’d sleep like a baby tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Rather take care of that myself. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I was referring to the rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Trenton Pests is sending a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's not what you think. I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes, but actually we're having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>We're working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>Mark</speaker><content>Wow, wish I'd become a doctor. Place would be spotless. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Take ten minutes, cure the guy, and stop whining. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I give you Kalvin Ryan; so flamboyant in person, so boring on paper. Obviously got an opportunistic infection, probably TB or PCP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Have you read his file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I started, but I found the characters two-dimensional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He went to an HIV clinic last week. Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV. It's not an infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>HIV clinic. So few patients, so much money;  re-do the tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The results make sense. Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.That's strong enough to fight infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Fine, parasite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Nope, stool sample was negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Two months ago, he was down to 30 T-cells, then he changed his meds, his immune system rebounds, his viral load drops, everything's getting better but he's getting sicker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Face it; this might be an interesting case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What if his immune system is too strong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>An auto-immune disease? With HIV, that's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep. It wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight. When it doesn't find an active infection, starts attacking the harmless remnants of old infections. Immune reconstitution syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His meds made him so much better, he made himself sick. Sounds pretty--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>BORING! This is so not interesting. Chest X-ray and find the old infections, start him on steroids.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If you're wrong, steroids will tank his immune system. He'll get worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Now THAT would be interesting. Where's the coumadin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>If your patient's got a blood problem then blood thinners aren't exactly--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's for Stacy's rat; death by anti-coagulation. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Trying to win Stacy back by killing an animal... very caveman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't want her back. I just want her to admit her feelings for me. I go to Cuddy, Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her. Either way, I'm happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> If you want her back, either tell her, or, better yet, shut up, and cry yourself to sleep like everybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Hi, this is Mark Warner, 1724 Spring Street. Listen, you don't need to send that guy down, we caught him. No, you should send the bill to Princeton-Plainsboro hospital. Attn: Dr James Wilson, yeah. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Your lymph nodes aren't swollen. That’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Maybe Dr Chase should check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Sorry mate,  hands full.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>He's too pretty to be straight. You ever done any modeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Does anyone actually fall for that line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Every day. Why do you think I became a photographer? I'm guessing you guys didn't think about dating on career day. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I love my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Really? You seem more the 'find it exceptionally satisfying' type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm not sure there's a difference. Your mom died of diabetes. How's your dad's health?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Last I heard he had cirrhosis. Love, is love, satisfying is ‘social validation, fun can wait’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I have fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Yeah, she's got some scheduled for February. Last you heard? Your father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>He threw me out when I was 16. It's just as well; I got tired of getting BB guns for my birthday when I'd asked for a Barbie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Dads can be real sweethearts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Mmm, sensitive, AND cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's cute.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>It ran into that heating vent right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hopefully Mark's anger will go away eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He's not angry, just doesn't like you. Nothing unique there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Didn't seem really wild about you, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He's fine with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's angry. Said so in group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Of course he's angry; he's looking at months of painful physio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content> He's mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>There's no way he said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Past tense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Might be the hospital. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content> What!?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Bad time? Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His lungs are too scarred to tell which infection triggered the immune reconstitution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He a smoker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Yes, and possibly more than cigarettes. His tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not surprising. Not medically relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>His heart looks a little enlarged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>That's a typical side-effect of AZT. What are Kalvin's most recent infections?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Toxo, CMV and PCP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Well let's assume it's one of those. Give him Ganciclovir for the CMV...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Whoa, we can hardly hear you. Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>House</speaker><content>In a closet. Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up. Ganciclovir for the CMV, Sulfadiazine for the Toxo, Bactrim for PCP. Gotta go. It's killing time. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Your tox screen came back positive for--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Crystal meth aaand ecstasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Recreational drugs are dangerous to begin with, but for someone with HIV...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I didn't mistake them for vitamins. I'm a PNP boy. Party and Play. Drugs and sex.  You don't approve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Does the sex include condoms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>If he's negative, sure. If he's positive,  why put on a raincoat if you're already wet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You could get hepatitis or another strain of HIV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Or I could get hit by a bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>AIDS isn't a death sentence anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I don't want to have any regrets. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>How long have you been coughing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content> About an hour or so. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Try to take a deep breath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I think its blood. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>Doctor</speaker><content>I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis. Your chances of conversion are slim, but I'd like to put you on three antiviral medications; finavir, zidovudine and lamivudine. There are side-effects - headache, nausea, vivid dreaming. You'll be tested for HIV in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Very interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth, that's interesting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>The coughing part, not the in Cameron part. New symptom, blood vessel ruptured in his lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I closed the tear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well it takes immune reconstitution off the table. What's it put on the table?  Its ok, she's not here. You can skip the nice guy acts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You know some human beings are actually capable of human feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Could be Kaposi's Syndrome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No edema, no blood in urine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>KS on his face could mean KS in his lungs, with bleeding from the lesions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I would have seen them when I repaired the tear in his lung. Wegener's granulomatosis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Wegener's would have responded to the steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe you should go home, take the rest of the day. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh this is good, he's pretending to care, you're pretending not to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I think we should reconsider drugs. Kalvin uses crystal meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Concerned enough about his health to stalk me while indulging in deadly street drugs.  Study in contradictions. Interesting. Still not medically relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could be, if his drugs were tainted. They cook meth with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins  Foreman, you're with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I need a consult on another case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You have another case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's a hip-pocket deal. Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Wry Neck. Is he an athlete?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's a regular runner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Any pain associated with movement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>None that he's complained of </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Best case scenario, an infection in the ear or lungs; worst case, brain stem tumor. Should do an MRI, CAT scan, full work-up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Uhh… I don't think so  No insurance.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> No drugs in here. I'll take the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>How about a drink after work? Take your mind off what happened.  Cameron?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I might have HIV, a drink's not going to wash it away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> There's like zero chance of you contracting the virus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Big difference between 'like zero' and 'zero'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>What did the infection control guy tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He was very reassuring, kept reminding me that the hospital covers all my medical costs. Apparently forgot to mention that if I do test positive, that they'll pass it on to legal and legal will dig up any dirt they can trying to prove that I'm a drug user or tramp, and that's why I have HIV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>It's not like they're going to find anything, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Check this out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Kalvin's a photographer. The broken bulbs were props. Glass is from 1930's fluorescent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Some of the bulbs have date stamps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs contained large amounts of beryllium. Beryllium dust inflames the lungs, they get rigid, patient can't breathe.  My father co-authored a paper on acute berylliosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Phew! For a moment there I thought you were smart. Cameron, get a biopsy of Calvin's lung tissue. Run a spectrographic analysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I can handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No reason to risk exposing the entire team. Then who would I torment?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I'm sorry. About what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's best not to talk. You're going to feel a sharp pinch. This actually is going to grab a piece of your lung.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>What were you guys looking for at my hotel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Your drugs. Thought maybe you'd used toxic meth. We'll know if you're exposed to beryllium in a few hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Well if you're still curious, it's in my bag over there on the chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You brought drugs into the hospital?! Glad I wasted my time at your hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I told you I used; you didn't ask me for a sample. You're not pissed about this, you're mad because I coughed blood on you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Oh, would you stop being nice! It's useless and worse, it's boring. Get angry! I had one stupid night, I end up with HIV, do you have any idea how pissed off I was?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well I had to, Mark isn't here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He has physio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh really? How's he doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>What happened with all the cheese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any coumadin. I named your rat.  Steve's tilting his head. Any neurologist will tell you that suggests an infection or brain stem tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Death cures both those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well we can't kill him. If it's an infection, it could be caused by something in your house, something that could affect you guys . Smell this,  does it smell like urine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Oh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You missing any asparagus? Ok, stuff these.  He doesn't get better, then it’s a tumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Then what? Chemo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Steve McQueen without hair?  It's a blessing he died young. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Hello. Oh, hi honey. I'm sorry I missed you, yeah, I came home. Alright, I'll see you in a few minutes, okay, bye hon.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Chest hurts!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Heart rate’s a hundred and climbing, could be an allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Neck veins are out; must be pericardial effusion.  No wheezing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Tear in his lungs must have re-opened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kalvin, you're bleeding into the area around your heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I'm dying? I can't breathe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The blood's crushing your heart, once we remove it, you'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>If I die, please... tell my dad--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You're not going to die.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where's the blood? It's clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Only one other thing could cause this; a tumor in his heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart and several smaller ones in his lungs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>That's why his heart's enlarged, not the AZT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> You ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's fine, probably getting bored with the question. Masses in the heart and lungs, what kind of cancer are we looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>They may not be cancerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>This is classic Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma; HIV positive patient with a primary heart mass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It could be sarcoidosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>His lung tissue is negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So's an ear infection, but since he didn't test positive for that either…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I wanna do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed?  Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So… how is the patient's father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>‘Tell my dad I'm sorry?’ Might as well wave the red flag at a bull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He's not coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Well it's not a tragedy, dad doesn't want to see him, he doesn't want to see the dad. You're the only one who wants them together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He asked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He thought he was dying. Dying people lie too. Wish they'd work less, they'd been nicer, they'd opened orphanages for kittens. If you really want to do something, you do it; you don't save it for sound bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What did you say when you thought you were dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content> On the other hand,  his dad tossed him out. So what's our guy want to apologize for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Everybody has regrets.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>If the growths in your lungs and heart are sarcoid, your body will recognize this material and we'll see a reaction on your arm.  Did you really want to see your dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Did you call him?  Thanks. He would have come, try to straighten me out. How are you holding up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I'm fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Convincing. What did you do with my drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The lab disposes of them after analysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Too bad. They could have done you some good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not really my thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>You know I hope you don't have it, but getting HIV might have been the best thing that ever happened to me. I used to be a good boy. Never wanted to piss anybody off… playing by the rules makes everybody else happy. Now I'm happy. </content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So you just show up every time he's at physio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Course not! Also when he's at group therapy, or out for dinner with friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>And when she happens to mention to Mark that you dropped by?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You tell your wife everything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>It's a… process.  But Stacy doesn't have any reason to hide this from Mark.  As far as she knows, Mark's okay with you being there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible, 'cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me. And you know why she thinks that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Because she still has feelings for you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>If you're right, she did tell him, and I don't get through the door tonight. But if I'm right… </content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Til something happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He's not going to come out with us right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We are downwind, and he seems to have hearing loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He's not blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Steve McQueen does not run from danger. Antibiotics on the other hand… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He ate around the pill? Smart!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Admit it, you like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>He's alright… for a rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You wanna now how cool he is? His urine showed traces of hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead. He's a smoker. Your husband's been lighting up; which is particularly stupid, it could cause his AIP to…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Okay, I blow my smoke into the vents so Mark doesn't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I always knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Bluffing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You started two weeks after my surgery. Menthols, then lights after a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>Why didn't you say anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>'Cause it helped me monitor your misery level. One trip outside was a good day, upwards of six you were in hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>You could have asked me how I was!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I already knew. Sorry you were miserable.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Uh huh. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I thought you disposed of the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Not all of it. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I'm not going to grovel, dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>That's not what I'm asking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Like hell it isn't!  You said you didn't call!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't mind me. Just here for the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Yeah well, there's not going to be any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What happened to the big apology? Yesterday he was all ‘Daddy, I'm so sowwy.’</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>This is none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You should have thought of that before you stalked me. Now I'm interested.  So what's he got to apologize for? You're the one who tossed him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Now why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I don't know. 'Cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words of The Wiz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>That's a lie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>42nd Street? Much easier to just get drunk and beat him. Explains his hating you;  also your cirrhosis. Also why the more I talk, the more you sweat. What it doesn't explain, is why he's gotta apologize to you.  Residual guilt for sharing your special toy with other boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Just leave it alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just want to leave the bigot with some peace of mind after you're gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing to do with him being gay! Now Kal brought this on himself, with what he did to his mother!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He steal her signature look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>No. No, he killed her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Kalvin lied!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, that certainly is shocking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed a transplant, they tested Kalvin, he was a match. He was also positive for HIV, mom never found a qualified donor, she dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Tragic tale. Undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement. Too much coffee this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>He didn't kill her. Our bodies aren't donor farms for our parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's not 1980. We know how HIV is transmitted! If Kalvin got HIV through unprotected sex, dad has every right to be pissed!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>So you always use a condom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Uhh... yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Brother's on the down-low got to</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Huh, not ready for any Foreman Juniors yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Working girls are sticklers. You're not going to poll Chase? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I'm not an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Obviously not. Who doesn't sleep with a drugged out colleague when they have a chance? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Where's Wilson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>We got the result for the Kveim test. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>So… I have cancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>In all likelihood, yeah. Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>And I am… dying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>We need to biopsy the tumor. It's near your aorta so… getting that sample carries serious risks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Is my dad still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He hasn't been in?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Ativan. It’ll help settle you down. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why are you so calm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Not coming off meth helps. Last night probably shouldn't happen again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Do you think I want it to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>When two people have had sex, unless it sucks, if they can do it again, they're gonna do it again. And that's when things get complicated. And it didn't suck. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>So now you've got to drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life. Could hit another patient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Nyah, don't like to repeat myself. People will say I'm formulaic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I can't do that, Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke-free environment. Cigarettes aggravated his infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The rat is actually sick? That thing could infect the entire hospital!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Steve's infection is not contagious to humans. I'm an idiot. How did I miss mycoplasmosis? Was that the kid's father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. Remember the Black Death? Started with rats</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's he doing in the hallway? His kid getting his biopsy already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>He just won't go in the room. Who knows what else he has - parasites? Bacterial infection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Kid doesn't have parasites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not the kid, the rat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Was he still sweating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Rats only sweat through their tails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Not the rat, the dad!  Where are they from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Err… Montana. What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You were right, it's a parasite. Cancel the biopsy. It’ll kill him.  Hey daddy, come with me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Yeah, uhh… I'm not going in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Your son asked to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content> Why is he here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content> He wanted to talk to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you two use to hunt together? Foxes. Did you kill foxes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>It’s Montana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Those masses in your chest are not tumors. They're parasitic cysts from a bug called echinococcus. Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard, they can hunker down for decades -- growing, spawning, shopping, putting on plays.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I've been tested for parasites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-26"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, it's cancer. You happy? The cysts isolate the parasites, keeping them from showing up in stool samples, even in blood tests, cardiac--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-27"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>All right, you don't need me for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-28"><speaker>House</speaker><content>But you've got the same things in your liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-29"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>I have cirrhosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-30"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Liver cysts have identical symptoms with one addition, fever. Now liver cysts we can test for. Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's. So, option A, we draw some blood--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-31"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>No, look, you're not touching me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-32"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You see, this is why I need you here. I want you to tell your son that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-33"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content> You err… never expressed a shred of regret for what happened to your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-34"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Geez, dad…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-35"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>If you'd have worn a damn rubber, you'd have been fine; could have saved her life. You wouldn't be lying here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-36"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it! You're really mad at him for killing himself and for destroying everything you love. I don't have time for this, are you going to apologize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-37"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>I'm living my life the way I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-38"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Are you going to give me some blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-39"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>Look, if he doesn't give a damn then neither do I!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-40"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay. Option B. Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-41"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>She was a diabetic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-42"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>You know you don't know a thing about my Suzanne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-43"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Either Suzanne wanted to die, or she was both fat AND stupid. Used a Twinkie instead of a gun. And girls with big appetites, well they just can't get enough - of anything!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-44"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-45"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Probably nibbled on every devil dog in the county!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-46"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content>SHUT UP!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-47"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Just in case I'm not making myself clear, I don't mean the delicious snack…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-48"><speaker>Dad</speaker><content> You son of a bitch! Yeah? Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-49"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Thank you, means I can do this  We're going to need some epi in here, stat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-50"><speaker>Kalvin</speaker><content>Are you out of your mind?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-51"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You said you didn't care.  Notice how you can't breathe?  Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which!  I'm gonna schedule surgery.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-55"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You baited him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-56"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You're right. I was asking for it. The low-cut blouse, the 'Do-Me' pumps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-57"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>You flooded his gut with a parasite, he could sue. Go see Stacy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You haven't had a single visitor except for your dad. Drugs are great, HIV freed you, your dad hates you, you're so happy. Everything's a lie! You blame yourself for your mom's death. You're not trying to have fun, you're trying to self-destruct. You wanna kill yourself? Fine, but stop recruiting!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I'm the doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>My concern is purely legal.  Looks okay, does it hurt?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I just know you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content>And I know you. You're confident, arrogant, but you're never certain unless there's a reason to be certain. One other person knew, I told you I was seeing Dr Harper. You can easily get into her office, you read my file.  You read my file?  The dishes, the concern, the, oh, acting like a human being? You have… This whole time you've been manipulating me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You knew I had an angle the moment I poured soap onto a scrub brush.  You could have thrown me out, or ignored me, or found another exterminator. You didn't even tell Mark that I kept coming by. You LET this happen because you wanna be with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>Stacy</speaker><content> I don't anymore. Get out.</content></utterance>
