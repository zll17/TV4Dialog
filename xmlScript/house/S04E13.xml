<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> It's not my fault, I don't use nurses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Cuddy was looking for you, said she'd send you down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I know, that's why I'm here. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CAMERON</speaker><content>Because Cuddy hasn't found you yet. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Seriously? It's a very useful tool.  Complain, you make people miserable. They do what you want to make the misery go away.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content> No, you're ignoring the big symptom.  What if we're looking at both the flu and decent parenting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, you two are perfectly healthy. This guy wasn't pandering, he wasn't vanilla nice, he was nice without any aspiration for personal gain. I'm thinking genetic defect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Niceness is a defect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Three cavemen, see a stranger running towards them with a spear. One fights, one flees, one smiles and invites him over for fondue. That last guy didn't last long enough to procreate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>And how long has the patient been... suffering?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>At least as long as his wife has known him, 11 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>The chances of him having an undiagnosed pathology for that long...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>What are you saying? That evolution is wrong?  Where do you think we are, 21st Century America?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>He's saying that statistics are true too. That the world is a bell curve, most of us fall within the standard deviation, but there are outliers. And if we believe in the existence of extreme jerkiness, which I suspect that we do...  Then we also have to accept the existence of the opposite extreme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>You want it to be a symptom because then we're supposed to be jerks, which means you don't even have to try to be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Okay, maybe I'm biased, let's take a vote. Who thinks that niceness is not a symptom?  And who thinks that their vote counts?  You two  check out his home for toxins. Taub and Thirty-One...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>Thirty-One?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that either way was good with you. Taub and Thirteen, MRI for tumors and EEG for nerve damage. Test whatever comes out of him for everything else.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Too much axis tilt.  Don't release until your thumb's at the bottom of the ball.  I assume Wilson was busy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Still, it was nice of you to invite me, this is fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No, it wasn't. No, it isn't. I didn't invite you to be nice, I invited you because bowling isn't one of the two things guys do by themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>What's the second thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Other hand. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Well if people are incapable of being nice, why bother having the word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Ah, the ontological proof of niceness. The existence of the word proves the existence of the concept. Look out for those minotaurs on your drive home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>I thought motives didn't matter, only results mattered. So what are you going to do to screw up Wilson's relationship so you don't have to listen to me while you bowl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I wish the best for them and their tragically deformed children. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Well, she's good... At being bad. You might not be able to destroy her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well as long as I give it my best shot, I can hold my head high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CHASE</speaker><content>Cameron had this one insufferable friend. She wasn't going to get rid of her and I sure wasn't going to join them, so I just said, see her on Thursday's. I know it's not as exciting as an exploding birthday cake, but, hell, I don't want to hang out with her every night anyway.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content> Deal with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He needs a mother figure. I'm not saying you're not entitled to spend time with him, I'm just saying I'm entitled too. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I don't know how to deal with him when he's being reasonable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>This is reasonable? This is crazy. You're not a child, you can make your own plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>No, crazy is what House would normally do in this situation... Swap your lubricant with superglue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The man knows me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>This is his way of accepting us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>If he's not home till midnight, we won't be asleep till almost 2:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Wilson? Make a ruling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Uh no. You two are like dogs circling each other in the park.  And I say that with all the love in the world. You need to sniff each other's butts, bare your teeth, and arrive at some strange detente. Otherwise, you'll end up biting each other's eyes out. Again, with all the love in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I'll let you sniff first.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>A bad one.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Your attitude towards supervisory personnel is disrespectful, and a disturbingly large proportion of your comments are racist or sexist.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Nice in the sense that your toaster is nice for making you breakfast. It's the only thing his wiring will let him do.  He has William's syndrome.  Your husband is missing the genes that make him suspicious.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Or she scabbed. Depends on your point of view. So what do we think? New symptom? Or just a wife beater?  Hey, time for you to take this baby for a spin. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> We, uh, loaded him full of prednisone to try to fix the liver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Good news is, he's running out of organs to fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Prednisone could cause Roid rage, which could cause hypertension, which results...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Roid rage after six hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>At that rate, by sundown, he'll have eaten most of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content> Uh, it still could be penicillin, allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>How does a fried liver put him into a rage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>It's not frying his liver, it's frying his syphilis. The penicillin's working, the real patient is emerging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So... syphilis prevents domestic violence. I'm going to be even more attractive to the ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>I was going to test for a heart issue before the syphilis. PFO could explain the heart attack and reduced blood flow to the brain could explain the rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, they're all good ideas.  Okay, let's take a vote. How many think it's the roids talking?  And who's for the penicillin?  And how about whatever she said?  Someone hasn't raised their hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> Whatever I decide?  You're setting me up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content> PFO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The PFO's have it.  I just hope the bubble test is positive or it's no more Mr. Nice Guy. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>This is not good.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>He didn't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>FOREMAN</speaker><content>He never cares.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>THIRTEEN</speaker><content>He didn't vote. He always cared about one thing, solving the puzzle but he was irrelevant to that diagnosis. He had no opinion of his own. He now cares about nothing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well, that's not swearing, that's shrugging. It's actually the opposite of swearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I won't tell Amber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>My team thinks that I have syphilis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Why do they think you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because I knew that they had access to an old blood sample, and I knew they'd test it sometime for something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>Why would you swap your blood? What are you afraid they'll find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> Shut up, you're missing the point. Now, they think that I'm on penicillin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> Is this some clever practical joke that I'm not aware of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>And as I get better, I get nicer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content> That's brilliant. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Foreman thinks I actually value his opinion.  Thank god he said PFO, or I'd have had to do some dancing. You got time for bowling?  Come on, it's work hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>I'll get my shoes.  So we don't need to talk about...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>WILSON</speaker><content>So you're going to keep screwing...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>What if we lower House's dosage? Maybe stabilise him, he doesn't get worse, he doesn't get better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Quite the line to walk, if we're wrong he dies of neurosyphilis.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>House doesn't have syphilis, he switched the blood samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>House told Wilson, I wanted to ruin House's day. See ya. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>We're idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>We're not idiots, positive blood test means positive blood test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>TAUB</speaker><content>Apparently not.  There they are, let's see if they...  Uh, what are you doing? We're not done.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Oh! Uh... I know this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Either one, he has syphilis...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>I was going to say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Or two, the test was wrong twice, or three, he gave us someone else's blood. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Amber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Get that idiotic smile out of my face. I've got to go on a killing spree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Or, four, he has something that tests positive for syphilis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> It's not chagas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>He worked in Costa Rica before he was married.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Is two a spree, or do I have to kill you too? Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>I've heard of remote tribes that actually practice acts of kindness, or the chagas caused encephalitis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The MRI showed no signs...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>Until we started him on steroids, compromised the immune system and let the infection flare up. I did another one.  It's not much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content> It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis?  Damn. That should have been my epiphany.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>What's the bad news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>The cure is a grueling course of pills. It's like one a day for a month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>JEFF</speaker><content>Now you're just trying to make me laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Yeah, like that's a challenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content>You have chagas disease. It's a parasite, it's been asymptomatic for ten years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Well not quite. Your brain's been swollen, not enough to see but enough to alter your personality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>Now we're back to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>He screamed at you, you don't think he can change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>That was because of the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>So you think drugs are more powerful than parasites?  I mean... The ones we're going to give you to treat the parasites obviously are but... I stand by the principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content> I'm not worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>KUTNER</speaker><content> Neither am I.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>It was brought to my attention that on occasion, I am not respectful of hospital hierarchy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>The word was "contemptuous."  Well phrased, thoughtful.  Identically phrased.  These are all the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Because, underneath it all, we are all the same. And Foreman refused to type his up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Well, it's more than I expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>There's an extra one in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Your treatment of patients is non-existent because you're not a doctor, you're an administrator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>Foreman convinced me that these can be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> Your management of employees is, well, let's face it, they're outside carrying signs.  The strike ended, the nurses have been back for two shifts already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>You'd think I'd have noticed. What exactly did they do around here?  You act like employees should fear and respect you, but your eyes tell us...  Actually your eyes tell us nothing because we're looking at your boobs.  Which tell us that you're desperate to have someone jump on you and tell you they love you one grunted syllable at a time. What you want, you run away from. What you need, you don't have a clue. What you've accomplished makes you proud, but you're still miserable.  Please sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content> I got a call from Amber today. Says there's been a violation of your contract. You've been seeing Wilson on her time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>HOUSE</speaker><content>She breached confidentiality. You can let it slide, officer. We're even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>CUDDY</speaker><content>Yes, you are. You're both losing fingers.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>What's the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>JEFF</speaker><content>The ketchup. There's something wrong with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content> Tastes fine. Is anything else?</content></utterance>
