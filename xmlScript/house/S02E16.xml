<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She needs a lot of sleep these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Please. Ms Bardach, I haven't seen her for a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>I'll see how she's feeling. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>You know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>All done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Yeah. I uh... scrubbed for 45 seconds, did the nails, all the way down to the elbows. The whole deal. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>Are you sick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>No! No no no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content> Cough? Sore throat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>No no no. I just... sometimes I sneeze when I look at lights. Always have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>I'm sorry, you'd better--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>I would never get her sick. Please.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>A mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Got me by the bouncer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>She's crazy! She's let me out like 6 times in the last 2 months, every time is just to go to the hospital, I'm a prisoner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Aww, it's ok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>It's ugly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>No. I wasn’t looking at the scar anyways. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Take off your mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Uhh... if your mom comes in here...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Hey, give me a kiss or I'll kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Your skin... are you ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Melinda can you...hey what's wrong? What's wrong, is it your heart? What's wrong?! Mrs Bardach!!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Melinda, I don't know how to use this, I've never used one of these before!</content></utterance>

</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Cuddy called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I know. Saw the caller ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Young girl, anaphylactic shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You answered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Turns out, that's what stops the ringing. It's a weird case.  I thought you did the dishes last night. It was your day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I did. Those are new. Midnight snack. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>For a midnight snack you made a pot roast. The same pot roast I made last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah. Actually it was after midnight. Today is your day, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You want me out of here, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No it's fine if you stay. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>The place I was going to move, the guy never called, otherwise I'd already be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>I said it's fine if you stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah, that's why you're making me miserable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maybe I just want to make sure you do your fair share around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>That... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's weird about it? The girl with the allergies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Yeah. She's immuno-compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>What? You asked me--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>House</speaker><content>You knew that I was interested, that gives you a valuable bargaining chip. Could have had me doing dishes for a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Ok.  The allergic reaction happened while she was in a clean room.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Why did she have a clean room in her home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Heart transplant. The immune system's in the toilet, mommy builds her little angel a John Travolta quality bubble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Six months after the transplant, she doesn't need to be confined to a clean room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Six months without putting out, Dr Cuddy doesn't NEED to wear thong panties, but it's not our call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>I was wondering when you'd get around to my panties. She's had 4 days of work-ups. They've tested everyone who came anywhere near that room, everything in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Maybe it's not what was there; it's what she was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Exercise allergy. Love it. What sort of exercise could a strapping young man and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly be--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Mom was in the room within seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>So the boyfriend brought in an allergen and is lying about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Or the girl snuck out and she's lying about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Or the parents are lying about the room being clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>These are your big ideas? Somebody's lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Hasn't let me down yet. Re-check mom, dad, the girl, the boy, the room and the home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Any of you have a new soap? Detergent? Perfume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> And you haven't been outside recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>How could I? I'm trapped up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>You're not trapped, it's just safe--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>They won't even tell me the alarm code. Just tell her I can go back to school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Until we've cleared this up </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Fine. Find out what I'm allergic to and I'll stay away from it. Then I can go back to school. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's up to your parents, but err... medically, there's no reason...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Hah. Told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>Could I speak to you outside for a second, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>You know, this is hard enough without you--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>She asked my opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She is 16-yrs-old, lie to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>When I was eight, my mom she... she hated--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>I know, I... I need to loosen up. I'm overprotective, I saw Finding Nemo, I get it, I don't need another story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You're not just being overprotective; you're one of the most overprotective parents I've ever seen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She has the best private tutors. I let her friends visit, I'm not going to apologise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Just giving you my thoughts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She almost died 3 times during her childhood. Penicillin, bee stings, peanuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>I've seen her file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>Six months ago, we leave her home alone for the first time on a weekend. She goes out, buys one chocolate chip cookie, peanut butter in the dough. She's forgotten her epi pen, she drives to the hospital, passes out, has an accident. Steering wheel crushed her chest. She ended up losing her heart. So when you say to me that I'm one of the most overprotective parents you've seen, please, please introduce me to the ones who were more protective. So that I can find out what they're doing right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's allergic to having a sucky social life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Give the parents a break; they're just trying to keep her healthy. Everything in here is labelled hypo-allergenic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Check it anyway.  Cameron. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>This place is cleaner than her hospital room. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No alarm on this window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's a 20-foot drop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You can get to the tree from here, there's some bark scraped off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Sure, a heart transplant girl swung down there on a vine. Maybe she was hooking up with Tarzan and cheetah by the elephant graveyard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or, Jane stayed in the tree house, Tarzan came up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Ok, erm... I spent most of the night, Friday, but if her mom finds out about that, she will totally freak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>You guys had sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Yeah but... you know, I did everything I could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content> Latex allergy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>What do you mean, like a condom? We didn't...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You had unsafe sex? The whole unsafe thing didn't tell you something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Yeah... but we didn't like... we didn't... plan on it, you know... just... I don't know, we're in love. We've been dating for 2 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Practically a lifetime.  How about a semen allergy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>We're going to need a semen sample.  You can use the bathroom over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Right, uh... how do I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Aim and shoot. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>No thinking about Dr Cameron, we'll know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> We should tell her parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Why stop there, call the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Melinda's a minor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>And if we nip it in the bud here, teenagers will never again have sex. The parents will find out when they get the bill anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Oh, so you're fine with them finding out as long as you don't have to tell them personally?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content> Too bad it's not you giving the sample. We'd be done by now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Test was negative. No semen allergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on the night before the anaphylaxis, I don't buy that it's unrelated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>He loves her. Did everything he could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Love is an emotion certain people experience, similar to happiness. No, maybe I should give a more relatable example.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh snap! What did he do to protect her, brillo-pad his privates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I assume he washed and he...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Oh good work, assumptions are so much faster than actual questions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content> You the boyfriend? Need to borrow you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>What is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Did you take anything to stay healthy? Something stronger than an apple a day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content> Is he ok?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>He's just tired. From being in a coma so long. What'd you take? Don't worry, he can keep a secret.  Antibiotics? Penicillin? Any of those names ring a bell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Yeah, uh... my friend Elliot, his dad had like a whole bottle that he hadn't finished so I swiped it and took a bunch for like a week. There's no way I was going to risk breathing germs on Melinda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>This is the one downside of teenage sex. You're idiots. You almost killed your girlfriend.  She's allergic to penicillin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content> What do you think there was still some on my lips? I brushed my teeth!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Think lower, and more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content> I mean... it can... it can go through your stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Totally, dude! There's this administrator here, whenever she gets sick she just gives me the prescription.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>But you know they tested Melinda, they said she wasn't allergic to my stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Yeah, 4 days later. By that time the penicillin was crusting up a sock in the bottom of your hamper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>Dan</speaker><content>Do you have to tell her it was my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>No. Great part of being a grown-up, you never have to do anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>You're releasing her? What happened? What did you find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>The test on your house ruled out any environmental allergens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>Yeah, but what caused this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>We believe it's highly unlikely that this set of circumstances will repeat itself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>What set of circumstances?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's good news. She's healthy, but you might want to talk--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Cameron!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>I can't breathe!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Getting the epi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> No murmurs, no friction, no obstruction--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>Lewis</speaker><content>Give her the shot!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>What are you waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>She's coughing up white sputum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Crackling two thirds of the way up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Look at her neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She is vomiting, could you give her the shot?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>It's not an allergy, it's her heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What's the good news, what's the bad news? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Congestive heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Is which?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>I don't know, it just sounded like you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>New puzzle piece, always good news. What's the bad news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We've got 2 puzzle pieces from 2 different puzzles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Seems that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>What if her anaphylaxis wasn't anaphylaxis. Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could cause a seizure and then heart failure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>House</speaker><content>And get cured by a mommy-wielded epi pen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What if there really are two puzzles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>You think she had 2 unrelated rare conditions in one week?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We explained the anaphylaxis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>House</speaker><content>What do you mean 'we'? I did! Guess I thought I did, maybe I didn't. Still, it was all me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>And heart problems aren't so rare for someone who's had a heart transplant. I say we assume House was right about the anaphylaxis--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>House</speaker><content>It is tempting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> Heart failure could be either infection, coronary disease, or rejection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Sorry, there's a reason they call it the WHITEboard. It's not my rule. What ties both of these conditions together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Ok, we can all stare at each other or we can investigate what caused the heart failure. Just the heart failure. You wanna give me that BLACK marker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>There's no fever, so it's probably not infection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Or no fever because she's been on immuno-suppressants for about 6 months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Let's do a CT, get a heart biopsy... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not yet. So I hear you don't want teenagers having sex. Teen suicide rate isn't high enough for you already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>I just think those two are brats. Girl undercuts her mother any chance she gets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah it's the daughter's fault, has nothing to do with mom infantilising her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Good point. Explains why parents who don't pay attention get such nice well-adjusted children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>What's this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Think its vegetation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Yeah, the kind made of muscle that opens your heart valves. It's nothing. She's clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's good news. You don't show any signs of coronary artery disease.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>So what's next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Well, blood work to rule out infection, and then a heart surgical biopsy to rule out rejection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>But you don't think you're going to rule out both things, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>I'm going to lose this heart, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Hopefully we'll find the problem and fix it. You'll keep your heart a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>How long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>There could be drug breakthroughs that allow you to keep it for decades more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>Yeah. That's the answer my cardiologist always gives me. I looked it up on the web. It's like... 5 or 10 years, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> That's about the average.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>Melinda</speaker><content>That's why I need to have a life. Why can't you convince my mom to let me go back to school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Melinda, you've got bigger worries right now than missing school. Until we figure out what's wrong with your heart, the safest place for you to be is right here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content> Where is...  the hooker, I assume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>House</speaker><content> Right up here, buddy. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>You said you'd hang the stethoscope if you were having sex.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She was under anesthesia for the biopsy, if she lost oxygen...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Fasciculation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>Lewis</speaker><content>Is that serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's paralysis. And it's ascending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>She's going to lose the use of her legs?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>At this rate it'll be up to her lungs in a matter of days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>House</speaker><content>So... anaphylaxis, heart failure and paralysis. We couldn't put the first two together; I'm guessing we can't put all three together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Tick paralysis? Could also explain the anaphylaxis, maybe even the--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Penicillin allergy explains the allergic reaction much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Particularly because tick paralysis is usually accompanied by a tick. We did two comprehensive physicals looking for insect bites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Can we put any two of those together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>How about we stipulate? You argue that there must be something to connect all 3 symptoms, you mocked us for not figuring it out and finally you let us discuss the paralysis on its own because it's what's gonna to kill her. Now it's ascending, MRI's are clean so rule out stroke or aneurysm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>ALS? MS?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>Spinal lesion from leukaemia?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>Chase</speaker><content>She's immuno-suppressed. What about botulism?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Not unless she's been walking around on her hands the last couple of days. Botulism paralysis is descending, not ascending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>Cameron</speaker><content>Could be a virus. West Nile, even Polio with her immune system shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Get an LP. And do PCRs for the viruses. And get an EMG to check for Guillain-Barre. Foreman's right, we've got to find out why she's paralysed.  But not before staring at me dumbly for a few seconds. </content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>We ran more tests on your daughter. We took a lumbar puncture; got some spinal fluid and we brought it to the lab to look for infections that could be affecting her brain. We also did an EMG to check how her muscles and nerves are responding to electrical impulses. Unfortunately, her muscles are showing increased weakness above the knee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>You mean she's getting worse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>The LP and PCRs ruled out Polio and West Nile. We think its Guillain-Barre. Her body's immune response goes haywire, starts attacking the peripheral nerves. It causes muscle weakness and paralysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>Lewis</speaker><content>How bad is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>It's serious, but Guillain-Barre usually responds very well to plasmapheresis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>You see the plasma, the clear liquid part of her blood, contains most of the antibodies which are overreacting and attacking her nervous system. The machine spins her blood in a centrifuge and separates parts of the blood based on weight. White blood cells are the heaviest, then the red cells, then platelets and plasma. We discard the stuff that's causing all the trouble and return the good blood cells back to her body in a replacement fluid. If it works, we'll see results in a couple of days.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-38"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She's going to need a trans-venous pacing wire. Ok, magical tick hunt is over!  Only real doctor stuff now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-39"><speaker>House</speaker><content>She's just going to get worse. Ticks produce more toxins the longer they feed. She's going to be dead in an hour, even if you pump her heart full of jet fuel. Unless you let me find the tick.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-41"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>The only thing I know for sure is that your daughter's heart won't last another 20 minutes without treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-42"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Okay, just need one final instruction, when I find the tick on the autopsy, do you want to know? I'm thinking not, probably will make coping easier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-43"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Stop talking to them!  Page Borsisky in Cardiology and get her team down here, stat.  Get them out of here, get House out of here too. Dr Wilson, I could use your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-44"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Well I don't know if the dopamine's enough. She may need an inamrinone lactate. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-45"><speaker>Barbara</speaker><content>Why? What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-46"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>She doesn't--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-47"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>She might need stronger pressers and they don't have any in radiology.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-48"><speaker>Cuddy</speaker><content>Inamrinone can cause arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-49"><speaker>Wilson</speaker><content>Not inamrinone could cause death. Death's worse. We have to get her up to the ICU.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>House</speaker><content>None of them! The building's on fire! We treat her symptoms, she dies, we find the cause, she lives. That tick is an IV drip of poison, we unhook it, she'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content> This is my last atropine. Buys us about 3 minutes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>House</speaker><content>Maxilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>Foreman</speaker><content>Checked.  Down to 38. We don't have a lot of time, we've got to--</content></utterance>
