421 The One With The Invitation

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.]
Chandler: Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Joey: I know. Ross is getting married.
Chandler: Phoebe is, making people.
Joey: Everybody’s doing stuff!
Chandler: And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Joey: (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler: No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Joey: No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Chandler: Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!
Joey: Yeah!
Chandler: We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: What-what’s up?
Joey: We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler: Yeah baby!
Phoebe: Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!
Chandler: (dejected) Yeah, well…
Joey: We could get that Everest video though.
Chandler: Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
Joey: And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandler’s excited.) Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Chandler: (dejected) Oh, well…
Phoebe: So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
Chandler: Yeeeeahhhh.
Joey: Yeah. Yeah.
Chandler: But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Joey: Yeah we are!
OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Ross’s apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.]
Emily: So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ross: Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her some envelopes.)
Emily: Yeah, they’re fine.
Ross: Yeah?
Emily: If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
Ross: Sure. Why not?
Emily: Really?
Ross: Yeah?
Emily: I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Ross: Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?
Emily: Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.) More tea?

Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
Ross: You think?
Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

Rachel: Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…
Chandler: This isn’t one of those uh, y’know "If she doesn’t come, we-we don’t, we don’t come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…
Monica: You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?

CLOSING CREDITS
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do whilst in London.]

Joey: It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
Chandler: Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
Joey: I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Chandler: If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Joey: Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
