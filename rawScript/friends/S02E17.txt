OPENING TITLES 
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Chandler, and Ross are seated. Rachel is walking over with coffee and a piece of pie.]
[Someone bumps into Rachel and she drops the pie in a guy's hood that's seated at the table. She improvises by using the plate as a saucer for the coffee.]
RACHEL: OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece.
[Phoebe enters]
PHOEBE: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.

GUY: What're you doing?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is outside the bathroom yelling at Ross who's in the bathroom.]
MONICA: Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.

MONICA: But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
JOEY: I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
PHOEBE: Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
JOEY: You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
MONICA: I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
[Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is sitting between Rachel and Ross.]
ROSS: I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
CHANDLER: But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
ROSS: Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
RACHEL: Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.

There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.

CHANDLER: Alright, so what's it about?
JOEY: Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
CHANDLER: Well I like both eggs equally.
JOEY: Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
CHANDLER: Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Monica are fighting over the remote.]

MONICA: I just can't stand you being here all the time.
ROSS: Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
MONICA: Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
ROSS: Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
MONICA: Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
ROSS: You hated me when we were kids?
MONICA: Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
ROSS: Why did you hate me?
MONICA: Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
ROSS: And that wasn't fun for you?
MONICA: Duh-huh!
ROSS: I can't believe you hated me.
MONICA: Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
ROSS: Really?
MONICA: Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
ROSS: I can do that.
MONICA: Then I won't have to kill you.

[Phoebe enters]
PHOEBE: Hey.
ALL: Hey.
PHOEBE: Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
ALL: No.
PHOEBE: Yes.
RACHEL: Well, how did you find out?
PHOEBE: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
MONICA: So what're you gonna do?
PHOEBE: Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
MONICA: Sure.
PHOEBE: I mean this poor woman.
ROSS: What woman?
PHOEBE: The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
RACHEL: OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
PHOEBE: Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.
[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]
CHANDLER: Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
EDDIE: No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
CHANDLER: [stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
EDDIE: Y-, y-, you like that show?
CHANDLER: You don't like that show?
EDDIE: Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
CHANDLER: Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
EDDIE: I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
CHANDLER: Oh o-, OK man.
[Joey's place. He's watching Baywatch, lauging. He goes to say something to Chandler in the other chair but no one's there. He goes to call Chandler but decides not to.]
[Chandler's. He's playing foosball by himself.]
[Joey's. Playing ping pong by himself.]
[All by myself is playing. Chandler is sitting in front of a window while it's raining outside. We see Joey through a rainy window. The camera zooms out to show it's just his tabletop water sculpture.]
CLOSING CREDITS
