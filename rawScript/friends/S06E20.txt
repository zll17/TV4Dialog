Joey: Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.
Phoebe: (tremendously overacting) Fine! I’ll do it without you! (Joey gives her thumbs up) I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own! (Joey closes the door to his bedroom.) You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!

Phoebe: I am.
Rachel: Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.
Joey: You really think so?
Rachel: Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
[And with that we go into the save the budget portion of the show, which features flashbacks from previous episodes. The first set of auditions feature high lights or low lights of Joey’s acting career. The first flashback is from The One With The Lesbian Wedding.]
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is there to watch Joey's first scene as Dr. Drake Remoray.]

Rachel:  I'm sorry, what?
Monica:  What?
Ross:  Excuse me?
Joey:  It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (Does this intense look where it looks like he's smelling a fart.)
Chandler:  Oh, ok.
Joey: (there's a gunshot on TV) There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..." (Does the smell-the-fart look.)

Joey: (on stage in an Austrian accent) Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)

A thing through which you can tinkle,
Or play with, or simply let hang...

Chandler: Oh, are we playing this?!
Joey: (entering, dejectedly) Hey.
Chandler: Hey! How’d the audition go?
Joey: Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!
Ross: Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
Joey: Yeah, did I fool ya?
Ross: Totally!
Chandler: So it did go well.
Joey: Oh, it went amazingly well!
Ross: Great!
Chandler: Oh that’s great!
Joey: Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Ross: Wow!
Joey: And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…
Ross: Oh, I love that guy! (Laughs.)
Chandler: Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Ross: (stops laughing) What am I doing?
Joey: I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Chandler: Well, it is overdue.
Ross: Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
Joey: There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
Ross: Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

Ross: (jumping to his feet in anger) What?
Dr. Leedbetter: Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Ross: You-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
[Cut to an outside shot of the museum.]
Ross:  (losing control, we hear him shout outside) MY SANDWICH?!!!
[Cut to a shot of a park.]
Ross: MY SANDWICH!!!!!! (Ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)

(The duck quacks.) You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
Monica: (startled) Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?
Chandler: (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!
Monica: We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.

Chandler: As crazy as soccer?
(The phone rings and Joey answers it.) 
Joey: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey listens.) Well, nobody told me! (Listens) Who’d you talk to? (Listens and turns around to see Chandler trying to finish the message.) Nevermind! (Hangs up.)
Chandler: You mean you didn’t get it from this?
Joey: The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Chandler: Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Joey: How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!
Chandler: I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.
Joey: Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Chandler: Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?
[Joey just laughs as a third set of flashbacks featuring Chandler’s mistakes starts. The first flashback is from The One With The Prom Video.  It's Chandler telling Phoebe how much he hates the bracelet Joey bought him.  They're both at Central Perk.]
Chandler:  You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Phoebe:  It's not that bad.
Chandler:  Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]

Chandler:  Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…
Joey:  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler:  No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey:  What?!! That’s even worse!!
Chandler:  How is that worse?!
Joey:  I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Chandler:  You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Joey:  Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
[Cut back to Joey and Rachel’s apartment.]
Chandler: Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
Joey: Name one!
[Chandler proceeds to point out Joey’s errors in this forth set of flashbacks. The first flashback is from The One With The Cat.   Chandler has just returned home to see that their apartment has been cleaned out and finds Joey trapped in the entertainment center.]

Lorraine: She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.

Commercial Break
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Rachel are consoling Chandler.]
Chandler: I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
Monica: Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there? (Chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…
Chandler: Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
Rachel: Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Chandler: Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
Rachel: Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
Monica: Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay…
Chandler: You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?
Rachel: I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.

Ross: It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Ross: I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
Rachel: What?!!
Ross: I fell asleep!
Rachel: (mocking him) You fell asleep?!
Ross: It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Rachel: Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)

Rachel: Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
Monica: Did you just flick me?
Rachel: OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]

(Rachel tackles Monica onto the couch.)
Phoebe: Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
(They wrestle on the couch for a little while until Monica gets the upper hand and pulls Rachel off of the couch by her sock.  Monica removes Rachel's sock and starts beating her with it.)This leads to wrestling on the floor. This finally angers Phoebe.)
Phoebe: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
(Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear.)
Monica and Rachel: Ow! Ow! Ow!
Phoebe: I know!  I know!  I know!

Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you!

Ending Credits
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Joey and Phoebe are reading a scene from Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.]
Joey: Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Phoebe: (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
Joey: Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry you.
(Suddenly Ross jumps up from behind the counter armed with a plastic gun. By the way, he’s overacting too.)
Ross: That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when you’re dead!
Joey: Ross, you don’t have to yell.
Ross: There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. 
Phoebe: I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where’d Ross go?"
Ross: Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
Phoebe: Yeah?
Ross: Oh my God. I mean…
Joey: Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
Phoebe: (To Ross) He’s holding us back.
Ross: Totally.
